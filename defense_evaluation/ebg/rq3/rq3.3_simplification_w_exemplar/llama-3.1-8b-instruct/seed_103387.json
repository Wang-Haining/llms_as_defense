            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper looks at two ways to understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The first way is called the biological model. This model looks at things like genes and medical problems that can affect sleep. The second way is called the sociocultural model. This model looks at how sleep is affected by things like race, income, and where people live.\n\nThe biological model studies how genes and medical problems can affect sleep. For example, a study with mice found that special molecules called orexin help regulate sleep and wakefulness. The study showed that a certain kind of receptor in the brain called GABAB can affect sleep. The researchers found that a special medicine called baclofen can help mice sleep. This means that the research on mice can help us understand how sleep works in humans.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how sleep is affected by things like where people live and how much money they have. If people inherit a problem with their GABAB receptors, it can affect their sleep. This can make it hard to do everyday tasks like going to school or work.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem that can be caused by different things. It can be a primary sleep disorder, which means it is a sleep problem on its own. Or it can be caused by another mental health problem. Insomnia can also be caused by medical problems or taking certain substances.\n\nThere are different types of sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and others. Insomnia is when a person has trouble sleeping, and hypersomnia is when a person has trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that involves falling asleep suddenly.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how things like race, income, and where people live can affect sleep. For example, some people may have trouble sleeping because of stress or because they do not have a comfortable place to sleep.\n\nThis paper will look at the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the research.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we will explain what the disorder is. Next, we will discuss how to diagnose it. Finally, we will talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. The brain cannot process sound correctly. People with CAPD can hear normally, but have trouble with things like understanding what is said in a noisy room. They can hear, but their brain does not work correctly to help them understand.\n\nThe first time people talked about CAPD was in the 1950s. They called it “auditory imperception.” Researchers started testing children with communication problems back then. In 1954, an Italian team developed tests for children with these problems. In 1961, a scientist named Kimura created a way to test how the brain works when we hear two things at the same time.\n\nCAPD makes it hard for people to do several things. They may have trouble knowing where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sound. They may not be able to tell when someone is being sarcastic. One sound can block out another sound. They may not be able to understand how to use sounds to do things. And they may not be able to tell when sounds are in the right order.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a person must be tested. This can be done by a specialist who listens to what the person does and how they respond to different sounds. There is no single test that can diagnose CAPD. Many tests ask the person to do things like listen to a series of words or numbers. Some tests also record the sounds in the ear and see how the person responds.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that disguises can be useful, but they can also cause problems. If a person hides their true identity for too long, they may lose themselves. Ending a deception can also be difficult. It may cause people to be angry or sad. They may feel hurt because they were tricked.\n\nDisguises can also cause problems in relationships. For example, in Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself. She is very good at pretending, but it makes her feel alone. She is not close to the women around her. This causes her more problems.\n\nViola's disguise also causes confusion. People think she is a man named Sebastian. Another woman, Olivia, falls in love with the wrong person. This is a big problem.\n\nThe play also shows how disguises can help people hide their true feelings. For example, Olivia and Orsino, two main characters, seem to have hidden feelings for each other. But they do not act on these feelings because Viola is pretending to be a man. When Viola's disguise is discovered, it makes Olivia and Orsino face their hidden feelings.\n\nSome people think that Olivia's feelings for Viola were not real. They think she was just attracted to Viola because she thought she was a man. But Olivia's behavior is also suspicious. She quickly stops loving Viola and starts to love the \"real\" Sebastian. This shows that Olivia may be making fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThe play is saying that disguises can be complicated and cause problems. People must decide between being true to themselves and keeping their relationships. It is not always easy.",

When the British took control of Tanganyika (East Africa) in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. Germans did good work in Kamerun and other colonies, according to writers at that time.\n\nBut in South West Africa, the situation was very bad. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach Africans. In South West Africa, the government did not help very much. Missionary groups taught many Africans, but they did not have much money or help from the government. The government spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in the colony. They made sure Europeans had good education. These education policies lasted a long time in South West Africa. Other German colonies had many Africans who could read and write. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated.\n\nThere are many books and articles about education in the German colonial empire. Many of these are in German and were written a long time ago. These books mainly described the education systems in the colonies. Later, writers in English wrote more about education in the German colonies. They compared education in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. One important book is by Cohen, who studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says the number of white settlers in South West Africa made the education system in this colony different.\n\nSouth West Africa has a mild climate, but it is also a desert. Many Europeans lived there because it was a good place to live. In 1913, over 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 lived in East Africa, which had the next largest number of European settlers.",
            "Many kinds of music are part of the Popular Music group. This group has changed a lot in the last 100 years. New kinds of music are being added every year. Most kinds of music have broken down into smaller groups. For example, rock music has many smaller groups like heavy metal.\n\nHeavy metal music is one of the most interesting kinds of music. It shows many different feelings, but usually it is dark and sad. People who make heavy metal music started to make their own kinds of music. This started a chain of new kinds of music. Now there are many kinds of heavy metal.\n\nIt is hard to say what heavy metal is. Many kinds of music have joined it. But it started from something. To understand heavy metal music, you must know where it came from.\n\nHeavy metal is a kind of music that is dark. It is loud and has a lot of beat. People who make heavy metal music are very good at their instruments. They show this in their music. Heavy metal music is also often about complicated feelings and is influenced by drugs. Many people used psychedelic drugs in the 1970s. This led to new and strange music. Heavy metal music has many dark qualities. It shows feelings that most music does not show.\n\nHeavy metal has taken some of its ideas from the Romantic Era. This era was very emotional and sad. Many heavy metal songs are about these strong feelings. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a famous heavy metal song. It shows the darker side of the Beatles. This song was a response to another song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau painted his dream. But his dream was not just in the painting. It was also his own dream as an artist. The Dream, a painting from nineteen ten, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a magical place in her dream. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be recognized and admired by other artists and people who love art. But he had a big problem. He had to choose between being like other artists and being himself.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know something about his life. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, eighteen forty-four, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a businessman. Rousseau grew up without any formal training in art. He worked for many years until he was forty. He was an employee of the government, collecting taxes at the border. People sometimes called him a customs inspector.\n\nRousseau's first wife died when their eight babies were young. He was left with one daughter, Julia, and a lot of sadness. He wanted a new life. He started painting to find comfort. Rousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful pictures of peasants. He was a folk painter. He painted about common people like himself.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was not educated in art, and he started painting late in life. Many other artists were famous and well-known during that time. Rousseau did not get recognition until Matisse became famous. A writer said that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a special way to avoid being boring. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as a good artist.\n\nThe Dream is Rousseau's work that shows his big problem. He wanted to fit in and be accepted, or be himself and be different. This was a problem he had his whole life.",
            "Many people think there is a strong connection between what is right and wrong (ethics) and what is beautiful (aesthetics). I think there is a good reason for this. A famous writer, John Keats, once said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. That is all / You know on earth, and all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life, but we often know when something is beautiful or right without being taught. We try to explain why something is beautiful or right, but we can't always give a complete answer. Our studies of morality and beauty are not just about rules, but about understanding why something is good or beautiful. \n\nWhen people talk about why a painting or a book is good, they often use words like \"good\" or \"beautiful,\" but it's hard to describe exactly what makes it so. For example, when someone talks about the famous painting \"Mona Lisa,\" they might talk about the background or the face, but it's hard to explain why it is so special. When asked why they like a certain book or picture, people often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think that's true for both art and morality. Even if we try to explain the good qualities of a piece of art or a moral idea, there is something more to it that we can't fully explain. This \"something\" is what I think makes art and morality special.\n\nI think art and morality are connected because they both touch us deeply, even if we can't fully understand them. They are hard to explain, but we know when we experience them. This connection is especially strong when we talk about literature. Literature is a special kind of art that deals with values and what is right and wrong. We find meaning and values in literature that we can apply to our lives.",
            "The Germany of today is a strong country with a special culture. It is a mix of different parts and influences. You can feel this mix in many cities, like München near the Alps and Kiel near the Baltic Sea. The same feeling is in cities like Köln on the Rhine River and Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many different groups and tribes have lived there. The country we know today comes from these different groups.\n\nGermania is the land where the Germans come from. But where did the name \"Germania\" come from? Some people think it comes from a group called the Tungrians, who were also called Germans. They lived near the Rhine River. They fought with a group called the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" to talk about the Germanic tribes. He got this word from the Gauls. Caesar used it to talk about the tribes he had not conquered. He wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He said they lived beyond the Rhine River and fought with the Gauls all the time.\n\nOther people think the name \"Germania\" comes from a spear called a \"ger.\" Or it might come from an old Irish word that means \"to shout.\" This means the Germans were loud.\n\nA Roman historian named Tacitus wrote a book about the origins of the Germans. He said they were the original people of the area. They did not come from other places and mix with other groups. They were a separate people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They would go to Germany to trade and fight, but they did not stay. The Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire and traded with them. They also served in the Roman army.",
            "I stared down at the view in front of me. My mind was empty and blank. I looked at the picture without thinking about it. My thoughts came and went quickly. It was like my mind was watching something, but not really thinking about it. \n\nI used to want to learn how to draw. When I was a little boy, six years old, I wanted to draw. I got a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people how to draw. It says to put a square around a picture to make it simpler. This helps people see what is important. \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. I had trouble thinking about the table as a simple plane. I was too busy looking at all the details. I felt like I was seeing something amazing. \n\nMany artists, like Picasso and Monet, used different colors in their work. I wanted to be a good artist. I wanted to make something special. I named my picture \"Work in Brown.\" \n\nMy hand was moving to draw, but then it stopped. I was using the toilet. I was trying to get rid of something. It was brown and not pretty. I wanted to get rid of it. I had a mop in my hand. I was standing with my feet apart, wearing a green tie. I was not happy about the mess. \n\nI tried to clean it, but it would not go down the toilet. I got frustrated. I thought about how I must be the only one to clean the bathroom at Rite Aid. I got some toilet paper and put my hand in it. I was trying to get my hand clean. \n\nI used toilet paper to make my hand clean. It was hard to do. I had to bend down and use my hand to take out the dirty thing. It was a sad and dirty job. I was not happy about it.",
            "Many young people are killed in car accidents.  There are several reasons for this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say that one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving.  Young drivers also have little experience behind the wheel.  This causes more accidents and more bad driving.  Teens do worse when they drive with their friends.  A study in California showed that older passengers are safer.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make driving safer for teens by limiting the hours they can drive and who they can take with them.  But some think these rules are not enough.  The problem is that teens are not ready to handle the risks of driving.  A psychologist says 18 is too young to get a driver's license.  He says young people often want to take risks for fun.  It makes sense to wait until this wanting to take risks goes away.\n\nIf we give driver's licenses to young teens, we will see more accidents.  The number of people killed in car accidents will be very high.  In a few years, a lot of new drivers will be on the road.  We can make a law to solve this problem.  Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car.  A learner's permit can still be given before a full license.  People must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours.  The number of hours can be the same as most states now use.  This law would help stop teen drivers from getting hurt.\n\nThis idea is not new.  We just need to make it a national law so it helps everyone.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films. I wanted to watch all the trick films made from 1895 to 1901. There were 15 of them. These films make use of special editing to create tricks. My study focused on how these films use words and examining some special features of a few later films.\n\nMost trick films from that time are set in one place. They do not use camera movement. They use long and medium shots. They follow a rule that one shot of film equals one scene. However, some early films break these rules by using more than one shot.\n\nA common feature of trick films is that they are filmed inside a set with a front stage. The camera does not move from this position to follow actors or objects. This style comes from the theatre and magic shows. Because of this style, actors do not move towards or away from the camera. They only move from side to side.\n\nFor example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the stage. The camera does not move with them.\n\nMost trick films are long shots and, less often, medium shots. Close-up shots are not used in any of the trick films from the Edison collection. This is because the theatre and magic shows do not use close-up shots. The audience sees the whole performance at one time, framed by the stage borders.\n\nMost trick films are short, lasting about one minute or less. They often show short magic tricks, such as disappearing and switching acts with little story. However, a single shot in a trick film can be made up of several joined shots to create an illusion. For example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look shows the moment when the shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins, even though the whole film is one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, but his work in politics made him famous for his ideas about freedom and government.  He believed that farming was the best way to live.  This idea helped shape his ideas about the government and its power.  He wanted to protect and help farmers like himself.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States was lucky.  It did not have old traditions that could block the creation of a good government.  He believed people have natural rights that are very important.  These rights include freedom and the right to own property.  He thought these rights should be safe from the government.  He said that in a natural state, people with strength and bad intentions often win.  But in a civilized society, this should not be true.\n\nTo make a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should help people be good and not evil.  He believed that the government should be fair and just.  He said governments are like people – they can be good or bad.  He believed that good principles are those that protect property, help farming, and are fair to all people.  A good government would work well no matter who is in charge.  He thought people are motivated by self-interest, but this is not always bad.  It is bad when it hurts others.\n\nJohn Taylor wanted the government to follow the rules of the Constitution closely.  He wanted a small government with only the powers listed in the Constitution.  He thought a big government is expensive and can be unfair.  But he also thought that following the rules too strictly can be a problem.  He believed that the Declaration of Independence is more important than the Constitution.  It says the United States is a group of states, not just one country.",
            "There was a big drop in the number of people filling out the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a problem. It was hard to know why this happened. The winter season had started at the college. Fewer people ride bicycles or walk to school. This could be one reason for the drop. It was also the end of the fall semester. People were busy with schoolwork and finishing their grades. They may not have had time to fill out the log. The holiday season started in December. Students and teachers do not have to come to school. This means there were fewer people who needed to use the log. Classes started again in late January. But the number of log submissions was still low in February. It was hard to understand why this was. Maybe projects like this start strong and then slow down. We tried to make the project exciting again with Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special promotion. It worked and more people filled out the log in March.\n\nIt is hard to get people to change their habits. Many people like to drive their cars because it is free to do what they want, when they want. This is a big problem for projects like ours. We need to give people good reasons to change their behavior. We gave prizes to people who participated. The prizes were gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. It would be interesting to know if bigger prizes would have worked better. For example, giving away a bicycle or a car could have helped. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had given better prizes over time, that might have helped. The prizes we gave were good at first. But if we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, people might have been more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security that tracks a group of stocks, a commodity, or a basket of assets. It is more flexible than an index fund and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of diversification and single stock ownership. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy just one share. The cost of an ETF is lower than that of a mutual fund. However, you pay a commission for each trade, like with a stock. There are many ETFs available, each with its own benefits and costs.\n\nWe are looking at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of its assets. We want to know if the benefits of owning a single ETF are the same as owning a group of the 10 stocks it holds. We also want to know if there are better ways to own these stocks to get the best results.\n\nTo make it easier, we are only looking at the top 10 holdings. Here are the stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a special calculation to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's risk and return. The chart below shows the calculations.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. It also has a lower risk, or beta, of 0.12. This means it could be a good option. However, we need to make sure the difference is not just by chance.\n\nTo do this, we look at the standard deviation of each stock and compare it to the ETF. Standard deviation is a way to measure risk.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land.\" This poem is considered one of his best. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in two places. The word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil, an old Roman writer. Virgil used it to describe an island north of Britain.\n\nBut Poe got the word from another source. He liked the writing of German authors. A man named Karl J. Arndt wrote a book about Poe and another writer. Arndt said Poe copied some of this other writer's work. This other writer was Goethe.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer of Germany. He wrote a play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part came out the year Goethe died, 1832. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king who loses his wife. He starts drinking and crying. He then decides to die.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both suffer from loss and drink a lot. Goethe's \"Faust\" was also turned into a romantic play by H.P. Grattan in 1842. This was a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" He used it at the beginning and end of the poem.\n\nPoe and Goethe are connected through their writing. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a place called Thulé. It is a dark and lonely place. Poe's poem can be read as a companion to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" In Goethe's poem, the king is alone and sad. He has lost his will to rule or live.\n\nPoe admired the work of other writers. He respected Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a British writer. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of his respect for Tennyson. Many copies of Goethe's work were published after the original came out, so Poe would have seen it.",
            "Under California law, can a customer hurt in a fall on applesauce in a grocery store get extra money as punishment? This is because the store manager, Martin, was told twice about the spill and did nothing for 30 minutes to clean it up. He was eating dinner.\n\nA judge will not quickly reject Jennifer Palmer’s claim for extra money as punishment. To get this extra money, Palmer must show that Martin on purpose did something wrong that he knew would hurt someone. She must also show that his actions were very bad. Palmer can say that Martin should have known the danger of not cleaning the spill because many people slipped and fell in the store in the months before her accident. Martin knew this, but he still did nothing.\n\nPalmer can also say that Martin’s actions were very bad because six people slipped and fell in 2009 and he did not take action to keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was busy eating dinner and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill. Martin said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. Before Palmer fell, five other people had slipped and fallen at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for money to pay for her injury and for extra money as punishment.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money as punishment if the other person acted with “badness, cheating, or evil.” The law says that evil means doing something to hurt someone on purpose or doing something very bad without trying to hurt someone. Courts have said that behavior is evil when someone knows that their actions will hurt someone and they do it anyway.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at a college in Canada.  One big question in class was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this is a more important question now than ever.  Looking back at what happened since 9/11, I have seen how the media talked about Islam and extremists.  I don't think it was possible in 2001 for an American president with a Muslim background, like Barack Obama, to be elected.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad interests me.  I learned that his history is different from how I thought it was.  I used to think Muhammad forced people to become Muslims.  But his story says he was a victim.  He was humble and kind.  People came to him because they believed in his ideas.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and what Muhammad did.  One example is when he shared food with many people and there was enough for everyone.  I think the writers of his story wanted to show that Muhammad was a kind and honest person.  But this makes me think they are taking away from Jesus' teachings and trying to make Muhammad seem special.\n\nI also don't like that many stories in the biography are from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less real.  I think it's not good to use stories that are not direct.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the story tries to make Muhammad seem like a great and kind person.  But history shows that he did not act that way.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story about Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "This text is about the history of Christianity. After Jesus lived, the ideas he believed in were not followed. Instead, people moved forward with new ideas. If we look at history, we see that Christianity moved away from its start. Now, today, more people are thinking about the past and wanting to go back to the original ideas. They want to know what Jesus really said and meant.\n\nIn the future, people will become more interested in the past. They will want to know what was true about Jesus and what was not. This will take a long time, but it will happen. People will try to go back to the ideas Jesus had when he was alive. This will make Christianity return to its original form. A movement will grow and people will try to remove the new ideas that were added. They will go back to what Jesus said, not what others said later.\n\nAs this happens, the church will still be strong, but the new ideas will disappear. There will be less difference between different groups of people who believe in Christianity. They will become more alike. This is not the first time this has happened. Remember when Christians were treated badly by the Roman Empire? Later, the Roman Empire became Christian. Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly, but now they have leaders. The Christian religion will go through a big change. This change will take people back to the beginning.\n\nA way to make this happen is to look at Jesus' words as examples, not as things that must be true. So, what happened after Jesus lived?\n\nWe can look far back in history and see that there was only one religion, Judaism. This was the start of Christianity. People believed in one God and the Jewish scriptures were important. When the Romans took control of Jerusalem, the Jewish people were not all alike. They were divided into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.",
            "I think the book The Jungle shows that people are often selfish and only look out for themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. \n\nOne main way is the factory owners and managers. They want to make their factories big and powerful. They do not care about people or animals who might be hurt by their actions. The book says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky.\" This shows the big damage that factories are doing. The owners do not care about the pollution from the factories or the dirty water from the animal pens. \n\nThe owners and managers also did not care about their workers. The workers were very poor and worked in bad conditions. The factory owners would do anything to make more money. The book says, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a cauldron of hatreds and jealousies.\" This means the owners and workers did not care about each other. The workers were forced to work very long hours, and then the owners would lay them off without giving them any money or help finding a new job. \n\nIn the past, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant the factory owners and managers could do what they wanted. The workers lived in very bad conditions and were treated like slaves. The book says, \"Here is a population on the verge of starvation. They depend on the factory owners for their lives, and the owners are just as cruel as old-time slave drivers.\" This means the workers were treated very badly and had no way out of their situation.",
            "Many authors use special ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his book The Great Gatsby. He pairs words that do not usually fit together to create a certain feeling. He also gives meaning to a symbol, then uses it to create a certain feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses colors in a special way. He gives a special meaning to white and gray, and uses them to show the reader a certain feeling. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning for white and gray. White is like a nice, important color, and gray is like an old, faded color.\n\nFitzgerald shows this meaning at the beginning of the book. He says people are always wearing white. For example, Daisy and Jordan are always dressed in white. Even Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. But then Fitzgerald shows people who are not wearing white. He uses these colors to show that some people are more important and some are not.\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors for common things. He says Nick goes down \"white chasms\" when he goes to work. He says the names of people at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\". He uses these colors to show that some things are important and some are not.\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to show that some people are not important. He says Daisy is dressed in white, and people start to think of her as just a person that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this method to make readers feel a certain way about Daisy.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The climate is mild and sunny. Many types of food grow well here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a strong demand for organic food in San Diego. Many people want to buy food from local farms that use natural methods. Some farms offer tours and let visitors walk on the land. This type of farm can get government help and also make money from tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This can lead to more wildlife in the area. But organic farming can be more expensive than other types of farming. It takes more work to remove weeds and pests, and to fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Organic farms are often smaller than big farms, so they do not have the same efficiency.\n\nThe chosen land is a 160-acre area next to the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California. The land has chaparral, grass, and oak trees, and is near the Cleveland National Forest. This area is home to many types of plants and animals. Some of these animals are in danger, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople have lived on this land for a long time. First, it was Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of a original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing or wood production for many years.\n\nI looked at a real estate website to find a property, and then I researched government programs that can help small farmers. I found an organic farm in the same area that is an example of what this land might become.",
            "Culture is very important in any negotiation. What culture is and what it means can be tricky to understand. A culture is not the same everywhere or for everyone. People often think of a culture as a specific thing. But it is not. For example, saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are polite\" is not true. Every person is different. \n\nTo understand a culture, you must learn about its history, its attitudes and its values. You must not judge a culture as good or bad. You must accept it for what it is. This is especially important when you are dealing with a culture that is very different from your own.\n\nIf you are in a foreign country, you must respect its traditions and customs. You must be honest and show respect. If you are in a place where the culture is very different from your own, you must be extra careful. You can learn a lot about a culture by studying its history, its values and its customs. \n\nA company also has its own culture. This is true even in the same country. Every company is different. For example, some companies encourage people to work long hours while others give them more time off. You can see the culture of a company by looking at how its employees dress, how they communicate with each other and how they hire new people. \n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell you why people behave in certain ways. If people in a culture value harmony, they will not want to cause trouble. If people in a culture value winning, they will want to win at all costs. Understanding these values will help you in a negotiation. You must also try to learn about the person you are negotiating with. This will help you to make a good deal.",
            "The Bible says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is found in the Christian Bible and is also a point made by Thomas Aquinas. Both writers are trying to say God exists. We can compare their ideas because they both think of God as the God of the Bible.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea first. He says that God is like a truth inside our minds. We know God exists because we know God is true. Anselm thinks we don't need proof from outside to know God. This is called faith. We trust in God without needing proof.\n\nNow, let's look at St. Thomas Aquinas. He says we can know God exists through reason. We can see proof that God is real. Aquinas uses five different ideas to help us understand God. These ideas are change, causation, contingency, excellence, and harmony. He thinks that if we know the parts of something, we can know the whole. He says we can know God just by looking at the world around us.\n\nThese two writers have different ideas about how to know God. Anselm thinks faith is enough, but Aquinas thinks reason is better. We will discuss this further.",
            "A long time ago, over two thousand five hundred years, a prince was born. He would one day be called Buddha. He grew up and later rejected the world. He became very wise and his teachings formed the new religion of Buddhism. But Buddhism has changed over time. This is clear in the country of Sri Lanka, where people celebrate the annual water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is very important, but it was not taught by Buddha. It shows that Buddhism is different today than it was when Buddha was alive. This is true for many things, from small traditions to the main ideas of the religion.\n\nThis change is caused by many things, both from inside and outside Buddhism. Inside Buddhism, some people's ideas have changed over time. Outside Buddhism, other people's ideas have also made Buddhism different. Sometimes these changes are small and sometimes they are big.\n\nWe will use some special words in this discussion. Internal means a force that comes from people who believe in Buddhism. External means a force from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A hostile force is one that hurts or wants to hurt Buddhism. A benign force is one that does not want to hurt or help Buddhism.\n\nFirst, we will look at the main ideas of Buddhism. These ideas are very important. Buddhists look to three things for help: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the teachings, which include many texts. These texts are divided into three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the universe. These ideas include the idea of no soul, suffering in life, and that everything is changing.\n\nIf people understand these ideas, they can stop suffering. Suffering is a cycle of life and death. This cycle is called Sansara. When people are enlightened, they will no longer suffer from desire, hatred, and delusion. Buddhists also follow rules to live a good life. Laypeople follow five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have sex with someone you should not, and do not take too much drink. Monks and nuns follow many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries with a long history of rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The biggest problem between the two countries was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States defeated Mexico and took control of Texas and the American Southwest. Many other problems happened between the two countries. These problems ended just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans did not agree on many things, such as religion, customs, and traditions. They also had different interests. \n\nThis is like many other countries that have a long rivalry with a neighbor. Countries that share a border often have disagreements that lead to a rivalry. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with a long history of rivalry. David M. Pletcher (1977) says, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). These two countries are close to the United States and have been rivals for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States. \n\nThe two countries disagreed on religious issues. This is a problem that has happened many times in history. Sally Frahm (2001) says, “In the past, Americans were opposed to Catholicism” (p. 86). Like the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was partly about ideas and partly about what each country wanted. In this case, the ideas were about religion. The two countries did not trust each other because of the distrust between the English and Spanish. This distrust was a big problem in the early days of their relationship. \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 problems between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these problems were about territory. The United States and Mexico had many disagreements about border raids and other problems along the border. These problems did not end until both countries used their armies to control their borders. (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) says the rivalry between the two countries started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. The rivalry ended when the United States stopped trying to take more land from Mexico and instead wanted to help Mexico in other ways.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick suddenly. I was a nurse at that time. I chose nursing because my childhood was not safe. People said, \"You'll always get a job because people will always be sick.\" I wanted a safe job. My dream was to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow I am 46 years old and single. I have no money and I cannot work. To this day, I am still sick. I get money from the government because I am too sick to work. After 15 years, I have nothing. Every day is hard. I am not safe, I am not secure, and I do not like how I feel about myself.\n\nBut I know one thing is true. I would not have made it without my family and friends helping me. I was very weak when I got sick. When disaster strikes, people do not feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things will always happen. We cannot guarantee that everything will be okay. No matter how well we prepare, some things are too big for one person to handle.\n\nI agree that we should not trust the government too much. But I think we should help each other instead of relying on the government. We should learn to ask for help and to help others.\n\nThe people who built this country did not do it alone. They helped each other. They shared what they had. The people who crossed the country in wagons did not do it alone. They worked together.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and first aid supplies. But I also know my neighbors. That is the most important thing. Get to know the people who live near you. They can be your friends in hard times.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time. Are there limits that stop this change from happening? Scientists still do not fully understand this. In nineteen seventeen, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said it is hard to describe the shapes of living things using math. However, scientists are now using math to study how shells grow in certain animals.\n\nWe are studying how the shells of a certain type of animal called Prunum change over time. We are using math and experiments to understand how these changes happen. We looked at pictures of Prunum shells and used math to create models of how the shells might look. We then compared these models to real shells.\n\nA shell is a tube that grows over time. It turns in a circle, or spiral, as it grows. This spiral is made up of many round circles, called whorls. Whorls are connected by a line called a suture. The last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The tip of the spiral is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, and from the front. The most common way to look at a shell is from the side, with the front facing the viewer.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we look at it from the top and find the first line that divides the shell. We then count the whorls from this line, counting a quarter of a whorl if it is not a whole one.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a path that the animal walks through time and space as it grows its shell. We can follow this path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the whorl. We can use math to represent this path. Once we have this math, we can change the way the shell grows.",
            "Indonesia has problems with many babies dying before they are one year old and after they are born.  This has not gotten better in the last ten years.  Indonesia is working to meet its goals made in 2000.  But the country is not improving as fast as it should in the important areas of child and mother health.\n\nOne good thing is that now 72% of babies have a trained health worker helping them when they are born.  But this number still has problems.  Some of these workers are not doctors and cannot help if a problem happens during birth.  This means many women die during birth.  Indonesia is not doing enough in this area.\n\nAnother problem is that fewer children under five who get sick with diarrhea are getting help from a health worker.  We also do not have enough information about how well mothers are taking care of themselves after giving birth.\n\nFew mothers in Indonesia have a surgery called a cesarean section.  This is not good.  Even in cities, only 7% of mothers have this surgery.  In small towns, it is only 2%.  This means that many women in small towns do not have easy access to healthcare.\n\nSome people do not have healthcare services because they are too poor.  They cannot afford to pay for the help they need.  This is a big problem.\n\nSo, the big question is: how can Indonesia fix these problems?  Should the country make special programs to help one area at a time, or should it make the healthcare system better overall?  Making special programs can be good because they have clear goals and can make things happen quickly.  But making the healthcare system better can help more people and is more important in the long run.\n\nThe problem with making special programs is that they can take money and workers away from other areas of healthcare.  This can cause other problems, like making it harder for people to get the help they need.",
            "Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two novels that do not follow the normal way of Victorian novels.  Victorian novels are known for being very detailed about the lives of the wealthy people of that time.\n\nBut these two novels are different. They have mystery and strange events that make the characters more interesting. This makes us understand their feelings and reasons for doing things.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Oliver heard many confusing and scary ideas in his head. It was as if he was still talking to two men who were angry with each other. He was unsure of his body and his mind. He heard the sound of guns and people shouting. He saw lights and felt a lot of noise. He was moved quickly away from the noise. He felt pain all the time.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange events like this help us understand Oliver's feelings. These events show what hurts Oliver and what he thinks about the world around him. Later in the book, Oliver remembers the time he was shot. He remembers it like a dream. He is still in pain and does not know what to do. The pain makes him feel scared. It makes him think that he cannot control his life.\n\nOliver feels sad and helpless. He does not try to control what happens to him. This shows that Oliver does not have much control over his life. He is easily hurt by the people around him. He is hurt by Fagin, the old man who owns him.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, there is also a strange and scary time. The day was short and night was long. It was not a normal day. The night was quiet but felt very long. Some people thought that time was passing slowly.",
            "I worked with a group that helped students after school. I helped them with their studies. I worked with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I thought something was strange. Some words he could read easily, but others he could not. He spoke good English, but I was sure he was of Latino descent. I met his mother one day. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. We used a few words in Spanish to talk. I then understood the problem. Adrian was good at reading, but he did not know the alphabet. I tried to help him. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story for two reasons. First, it shows that language can be a big problem in schools. Second, it shows that the problem is not always easy to see. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We all know that this is a problem. So, what do we do? In Adrian's case, I helped him with reading. But for other children who do not speak much English, the problem is more complicated. There is no one answer. We need to use many different ways to help.\n\nOne good idea is the dual language system. This means teaching children in two languages. Not just for children who speak Spanish at home, but for all children. This system works well. Children in dual language classes do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is not worth the money. But it is true. All children would benefit from this system if we used it more. To make it work, we do not need all teachers to be bilingual. But we can have helpers who are bilingual. This can make a big difference.",
            "Most of us are told from a young age that there is something bigger than us. Some people go to Sunday school, others to the Temple, and some search for answers on their own. Many of us believe what our parents teach us. But some of us disagree and think there is no more to life than what we can see and touch. We may change our values many times. Each person's idea of spirituality is different.\n\nMy father said cardinals are his favorite birds. We sat on our front porch and listened to the rain. Rain poured down from the gutters and drowned the plants. My father looked out at the rain, thinking or remembering something. He was thinner and looked tired. His hair was thinning too. I was afraid and sad because my father was going to die. I didn't want to talk about it because it would make it more real. I hugged him and sat close to him.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my birthday. He was in pain, but treatment kept him alive a few more months. I didn't understand why he had to suffer so long. I thought to myself, what kind of God would do this? I didn't say any prayers that night. If God existed, I thought, he wasn't listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to watch my father die. I chose to remember him the way he lived, not how he died. My father would have wanted me to be happy, not sad. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for the news. But no one called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a combination of old and new ideas. Ian Watt describes it as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" Many people have different opinions about Gothic novels. Some think they are not very deep, while others think they are great. The first Gothic novel was written by Horace Walpole in 1764. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Walpole used old ideas and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story.\n\nWalpole's \"Gothic Story\" combines old and new elements. He used old theatrical ideas and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story. The Gothic genre also uses old ideas about medieval times, such as gothic architecture and traditions.\n\nWhen \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things. Some people thought it was old-fashioned and not very sophisticated. The combination of old and new ideas makes Gothic novels remain popular for a long time.\n\nOne idea that is important in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. Chivalry is a medieval idea about how to be a good knight. In \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the idea of chivalry is used to show what is good and what is not. The writers of Gothic novels, like Walpole, thought that society was not living up to the ideals of chivalry.\n\nThe character Frederic in \"The Castle of Otranto\" is a good example of chivalric ideas. He is a prince who has suffered a lot and is very polite and kind. He is an example of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that is often used in Gothic stories.\n\nThe Gothic genre is complex and has many different ideas. It uses old and new elements to create a new kind of story. Gothic novels often use chivalric ideas to show what is good and what is not. They often use old ideas about medieval times to create a new kind of story.",
            "Supply chain management is a system of processes. These processes take goods from the customer's order to the raw materials stage, then to the supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver explained how to plan, do, and control these processes to please customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts to supply chain management: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base for all the other steps. Production decides when, why, where, and how products will be made. To do this, managers must know what customers want. To find out what customers want, managers look at the market. The market is the biggest sign of what customers need. Once managers understand customer needs, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory will make them best. This helps meet customer demand and make customers happy.\n\nThe next step is for managers to plan work and take care of equipment. Production is very important. If anything goes wrong, it can cost the company time and money.\n\nSupply is the second important part of supply chain management. Supply means making strategic decisions about what a company can do well and who to partner with. A company may have many teams working on a single product. Each team has its own equipment, workers, and special skills. The manager decides which team is best for each task. The manager may also decide to work with another company to help make the product. This is called outsourcing. The goal is to be fast and flexible while saving money.",

            "Duke Ellington’s legacy in jazz music is very important. He lived a long time and was able to write many great songs. Ellington is not always on the piano in his compositions, but he was great at writing music that showed off the talents of each band member. He created a framework for soloists to improvise, and also wrote music with a clear style that fit each piece. This made his orchestra sound unique.\n\nEllington understood the sound of each player and how they worked together. He used this understanding to write some of the most innovative jazz music ever. He also used voice as a musical instrument in his music. This was something new and exciting at the time.\n\nA good example of this is his song “Creole Love Call.” In this song, Ellington uses voice in a way that adds texture and color to the music. It is a slow, twelve-bar blues song with six parts. Each part is different, and shows off the skills of the different band members.\n\nPart one is a call and response between voice and reeds. The voice begins smooth, but gets rougher at the end. Part two has a muted trumpet solo that emphasizes some sad notes. Part three has a clarinet solo that is high and exciting. Part four has the whole band playing together, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections. Part five is the most exciting part, with the reeds making the call and the brass and rhythm sections playing in a special way. Part six is like the first part, but the voice sounds like an instrument.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music in many of his songs. This was a new and interesting way to write music. He was a master of making his band sound great.\n\nIn another song, “Hot and Bothered,” Ellington uses his skill at writing tight music to make a call and response between the trumpet and voice sound rich and full. He also uses the trombone to create a new sound.\n\nEllington’s music is full of new and interesting ideas. He was a true master of jazz.",
            "She never felt complete. This feeling started when she was 14 years old. It was still there when she was 17. She knew she wanted a person, not just a thing.

She had thought about it for many years, but could not find the answer.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm people who did not argue. They rarely argued with her, too. They just wanted her to be happy. But they worried about her independent spirit. She was a happy person with a fun personality.\n\nToday was not a peaceful day.

            "This study was to see if eating a diet like the people eat in the Mediterranean area can help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.  The researchers looked at a diet called the aMed diet. It is a special diet that includes lots of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains. It also includes fish and less animal products and saturated fats.\n\nPast studies showed that people who eat the Mediterranean diet have lower risk of death from heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke. So, this study wanted to find out if the aMed diet can help lower the risk of stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 for 20 years. The women were all nurses who were part of a bigger study of 121,700 nurses in 11 states. The researchers asked the women about what they ate six times between 1984 and 2004. They used a special form to ask about their food habits. Almost all the women kept participating in the study for 20 years.\n\nThe researchers found out about heart disease and stroke cases by looking at medical records and reports. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like smoking, body weight, and exercise. To get a better idea of the women's eating habits, they averaged the scores from the food forms over two years.\n\nThe results showed that women who ate more like people in the Mediterranean area had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Women who ate the most like this had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who ate the least like this.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market crashed, and some big companies were in trouble. We ask: how did this happen and how can we stop it from happening again? In simple words, the economic problem was caused by people in power making selfish and foolish decisions. They forced banks to give out bad loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks then sold these bad loans to other companies, and when people could not pay, the banks were in trouble.\n\nThe roots of the problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular so he changed the rules to make it easier for people to get loans. This made it easy for banks to give out bad loans. In 1999, a writer for the New York Times wrote: “Fannie Mae, a company that helps people buy homes, was under pressure to give out more loans to people with little money. This could cause problems when the economy gets bad.” He said this would lead to a big problem that would need help from the government.\n\nMany things happened that made the economy get worse. Banks gave out new kinds of loans that were hard to understand. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These loans connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. This made people and banks very dependent on the housing market. When the housing market crashed, they were in big trouble.\n\nThe five biggest banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's total money. In the end, some banks went out of business and others became smaller and had to follow strict rules. Fannie and Freddie, two big companies that helped people buy homes, had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky. It's when you tell your readers a lot of information all at once, usually to explain something that happened before the story starts. This can be boring and make your readers lose interest.\n\nMany writers know the rule \"Show, don't tell.\" But even experienced writers can still get stuck in long parts of the story where nothing happens. This is called exposition. It's like a voice in your head that says, \"Let's get the history out of the way so we can get to the good parts.\"\n\nExposition is like a character telling another character a long story. It's when an author tells the reader what happened before the story starts.\n\nImagine reading a story. You are told that the main character met her husband, got married, and he was murdered. You wouldn't expect that to take two pages. You would want to see how the husband loved his wife and how she loved him. You would want to understand why his death was so important.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add \"meat\" to the story. You need to show the reader how the characters feel and what they think. You can't just tell them. You need to make them care about what's happening.\n\nIt's easy to rush past some parts of the story. But that's where the best writing happens. Take the time to show your readers what's going on. Don't just tell them. Give them something to think about and feel.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. The police arrested him. His name is Shad Hostettler. The news did not show her picture.

Nobody has been arrested yet. The police are investigating.\n\nI think the news did not give enough time to this story. If a white person had been shot, the news would have spent more time on it. But because the man is black, the news did not spend much time on it.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot by a bullet. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police want help to find the person who did it. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe news also said there will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be in the middle to low eighties. They only talked about this for a short time. They wanted to keep us watching.\n\nThe news also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road. A man robbed the store. He is black. He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. I think they talked about his color too much.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer in Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months. That is 25 years.

            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is hard to break and is very special. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, anger, and hurt feelings. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves when they look at their brother. In bad times, the true nature of this connection is shown. When brothers feel strong emotions, they often pay a price. Part of understanding these emotions is dealing with the results of those emotions. When you look at your brother, you see a part of yourself. You see how others see you, but also how you really are. Your actions and the results of those actions show your true character.\n\nThe story of \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this connection between brothers. The two boys are very different. One is healthy and strong. The other is sick and weak. They go on a journey together. Disappointment and pride are strong feelings that come out in the end. Only one brother survives. The story shows how the strong brother feels about his little brother. He wanted a brother to play with and to teach things to. But the little brother was sick and could not do the things the strong brother wanted. The strong brother felt angry and sad. He even thought about hurting the little brother. But when the little brother smiled, the strong brother felt happy and loved him. This shows that the strong brother really loved his brother.\n\nThe story says that brothers understand each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. What brothers feel and do shows who they really are. In the story, the strong brother feels many strong feelings. He feels angry and sad, but he also feels happy and loving. The story teaches us about the connection between brothers.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and make decisions. As time passed and technology improved, people used new words to describe the brain. At first, it was like a piece of paper, then a book, and now it is like a computer. These comparisons are not very useful and can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. It changes these feelings into electrical signals. The brain uses these signals many times. It uses two ways of processing: bottom-up and top-down. Bottom-up means the brain puts simple information together. Top-down means the brain uses what it already knows to make things easier.\n\nLet's say you see a picture of a black box. Bottom-up helps you see the box's color, shape, and edges. Top-down helps you recognize it as a box. You might also think it's a black box on a white background.\n\nThe brain decides what is important and what to do with the information. This is called the attention filter. You can think about many things at the same time, but the filter helps you focus on what's important. For example, you might hear your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information. This includes three types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. The information is encoded first. It is like a code. There are different codes for different types of information. For example, when you hear words, the brain uses the words' sounds, shapes, and meanings.\n\nThe brain keeps information by using electrical signals. This signal goes between certain brain cells for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in special proteins in the brain.\n\nScientists have many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some come from computer science, and some come from studying the brain. The semantic network idea says that the brain has nodes, or points, that are connected. These points are linked because they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to the word \"table,\" which might be connected to the word \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He uses a story to show what could happen if people value community above the individual. The people in the story are told what is good for them, and they are not allowed to think for themselves.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are conditioned to be happy and not to question the government. They are told to obey the World Controller. This is not a real democracy, but a system where one person is in charge.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism by showing how people are controlled. They are not allowed to think about their relationships with others in the community. They are only interested in making money and being happy. The people at the bottom of the social ladder, called Deltas, Gammas, and others, are not free to make their own choices. They are told what to want and how to want it. This is called false consciousness.\n\nThe people at the top of the social ladder, called Alphas and Betas, know about the system, but they do not do anything to change it. They are comfortable with their place in society.\n\nHuxley also shows that people in Brave New World do not have deep relationships. They do not really know each other. They talk about each other's bodies, not about their feelings. This is not a real way to live. It is a way to keep people from thinking for themselves.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are happy to do what they are told. They do not want to be different or to question the government. This is a criticism of capitalism and how it controls people.\n\nHuxley is saying that technology and capitalism can take away people's freedom and ability to think for themselves. He is warning us about what could happen if we do not be careful.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room, which is far from the rest of the school. It takes a long time to walk from my home to classes in other parts of campus. I have to walk from Stuart Hall to the Willard building, which can take up to 25 minutes. Sometimes it's hard to walk in bad weather.\n\nI learned that a long time ago, the East Halls dorms were not connected to the rest of the school. There was empty land between them. Now, the empty space has buildings and sports fields.\n\nAs the campus grows, it's harder to move around. The best solution is to ride a bike. But a bike by itself is not enough. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be easy for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after a long time. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around.\" Riding a bike is good exercise and very efficient. You can ride 30 miles or more after eating a simple breakfast.\n\nI live off campus, which is far from the center of campus. I bought a bike and it's the smartest thing I've done this year. It takes 5 minutes to ride to Thomas building, which is where I have class. If I don't have my bike, I have to walk, which would take 30-40 minutes. That's a lot of extra time.\n\nIf I have to walk a lot, it will take over two and a half hours every week. That's too much time for me. I'm too busy. A bike helps me save time and be more efficient."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I want to help people in need. I want to work with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who are being hurt or neglected. I also want to help families who are having problems.\n\nThe values I will bring to this job are important. They include helping others, treating people with respect, being honest, and working hard to improve myself so I can help people better. These values are important to me, not just for my job, but also for my life.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. But I was not sure what job I wanted. In high school and college, I saw many people avoid their problems and some made bad choices. This made me think about a career in Psychology. But I was still not sure. So I took a break after I finished college in 2009.\n\nOne day that summer, I visited a friend. She had a 16-year-old boy visiting her. He was very nervous. She told me why he was there - to escape his mean parents. The next day, I went to the parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and explained that I was a psychologist. They asked me to talk to the parents. When I asked them about the boy, they seemed nervous and made excuses. This made me think about how I could help children like this boy.\n\nI also care about social justice. We say that each person is important, but we often want to be like everyone else. I am different and I do not want to be limited by what others think. In high school and college, I stood up for what I believed in. I wore clothes that were my style, I had bright hair colors, and I spoke out against racism and unfairness. I will continue to stand up for what I believe in.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The first way is called the biological model. This model looks at things like genes and medical problems that can affect sleep. The second way is called the sociocultural model. This model looks at how sleep is affected by things like race, income, and where people live.\n\nThe biological model studies how genes and medical problems can affect sleep. For example, a study with mice found that special molecules called orexin help regulate sleep and wakefulness. The study showed that a certain kind of receptor in the brain called GABAB can affect sleep. The researchers found that a special medicine called baclofen can help mice sleep. This means that the research on mice can help us understand how sleep works in humans.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how sleep is affected by things like where people live and how much money they have. If people inherit a problem with their GABAB receptors, it can affect their sleep. This can make it hard to do everyday tasks like going to school or work.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem that can be caused by different things. It can be a primary sleep disorder, which means it is a sleep problem on its own. Or it can be caused by another mental health problem. Insomnia can also be caused by medical problems or taking certain substances.\n\nThere are different types of sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and others. Insomnia is when a person has trouble sleeping, and hypersomnia is when a person has trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that involves falling asleep suddenly.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how things like race, income, and where people live can affect sleep. For example, some people may have trouble sleeping because of stress or because they do not have a comfortable place to sleep.\n\nThis paper will look at the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the research.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we will explain what the disorder is. Next, we will discuss how to diagnose it. Finally, we will talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. The brain cannot process sound correctly. People with CAPD can hear normally, but have trouble with things like understanding what is said in a noisy room. They can hear, but their brain does not work correctly to help them understand.\n\nThe first time people talked about CAPD was in the 1950s. They called it “auditory imperception.” Researchers started testing children with communication problems back then. In 1954, an Italian team developed tests for children with these problems. In 1961, a scientist named Kimura created a way to test how the brain works when we hear two things at the same time.\n\nCAPD makes it hard for people to do several things. They may have trouble knowing where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sound. They may not be able to tell when someone is being sarcastic. One sound can block out another sound. They may not be able to understand how to use sounds to do things. And they may not be able to tell when sounds are in the right order.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a person must be tested. This can be done by a specialist who listens to what the person does and how they respond to different sounds. There is no single test that can diagnose CAPD. Many tests ask the person to do things like listen to a series of words or numbers. Some tests also record the sounds in the ear and see how the person responds.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that disguises can be useful, but they can also cause problems. If a person hides their true identity for too long, they may lose themselves. Ending a deception can also be difficult. It may cause people to be angry or sad. They may feel hurt because they were tricked.\n\nDisguises can also cause problems in relationships. For example, in Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself. She is very good at pretending, but it makes her feel alone. She is not close to the women around her. This causes her more problems.\n\nViola's disguise also causes confusion. People think she is a man named Sebastian. Another woman, Olivia, falls in love with the wrong person. This is a big problem.\n\nThe play also shows how disguises can help people hide their true feelings. For example, Olivia and Orsino, two main characters, seem to have hidden feelings for each other. But they do not act on these feelings because Viola is pretending to be a man. When Viola's disguise is discovered, it makes Olivia and Orsino face their hidden feelings.\n\nSome people think that Olivia's feelings for Viola were not real. They think she was just attracted to Viola because she thought she was a man. But Olivia's behavior is also suspicious. She quickly stops loving Viola and starts to love the \"real\" Sebastian. This shows that Olivia may be making fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThe play is saying that disguises can be complicated and cause problems. People must decide between being true to themselves and keeping their relationships. It is not always easy.",
            "German colonial rule was very bad. The Germans were very cruel to the Ovaherero and Nama people in South West Africa. This is just one example. The German colonial empire was different in many ways. It had different rules and leaders in different places. The education system was also different in different colonies. When the British took control of Tanganyika (East Africa) in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. Germans did good work in Kamerun and other colonies, according to writers at that time.\n\nBut in South West Africa, the situation was very bad. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach Africans. In South West Africa, the government did not help very much. Missionary groups taught many Africans, but they did not have much money or help from the government. The government spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in the colony. They made sure Europeans had good education. These education policies lasted a long time in South West Africa. Other German colonies had many Africans who could read and write. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated.\n\nThere are many books and articles about education in the German colonial empire. Many of these are in German and were written a long time ago. These books mainly described the education systems in the colonies. Later, writers in English wrote more about education in the German colonies. They compared education in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. One important book is by Cohen, who studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says the number of white settlers in South West Africa made the education system in this colony different.\n\nSouth West Africa has a mild climate, but it is also a desert. Many Europeans lived there because it was a good place to live. In 1913, over 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 lived in East Africa, which had the next largest number of European settlers.",
            "Many kinds of music are part of the Popular Music group. This group has changed a lot in the last 100 years. New kinds of music are being added every year. Most kinds of music have broken down into smaller groups. For example, rock music has many smaller groups like heavy metal.\n\nHeavy metal music is one of the most interesting kinds of music. It shows many different feelings, but usually it is dark and sad. People who make heavy metal music started to make their own kinds of music. This started a chain of new kinds of music. Now there are many kinds of heavy metal.\n\nIt is hard to say what heavy metal is. Many kinds of music have joined it. But it started from something. To understand heavy metal music, you must know where it came from.\n\nHeavy metal is a kind of music that is dark. It is loud and has a lot of beat. People who make heavy metal music are very good at their instruments. They show this in their music. Heavy metal music is also often about complicated feelings and is influenced by drugs. Many people used psychedelic drugs in the 1970s. This led to new and strange music. Heavy metal music has many dark qualities. It shows feelings that most music does not show.\n\nHeavy metal has taken some of its ideas from the Romantic Era. This era was very emotional and sad. Many heavy metal songs are about these strong feelings. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a famous heavy metal song. It shows the darker side of the Beatles. This song was a response to another song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau painted his dream. But his dream was not just in the painting. It was also his own dream as an artist. The Dream, a painting from nineteen ten, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a magical place in her dream. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be recognized and admired by other artists and people who love art. But he had a big problem. He had to choose between being like other artists and being himself.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know something about his life. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, eighteen forty-four, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a businessman. Rousseau grew up without any formal training in art. He worked for many years until he was forty. He was an employee of the government, collecting taxes at the border. People sometimes called him a customs inspector.\n\nRousseau's first wife died when their eight babies were young. He was left with one daughter, Julia, and a lot of sadness. He wanted a new life. He started painting to find comfort. Rousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful pictures of peasants. He was a folk painter. He painted about common people like himself.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was not educated in art, and he started painting late in life. Many other artists were famous and well-known during that time. Rousseau did not get recognition until Matisse became famous. A writer said that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a special way to avoid being boring. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as a good artist.\n\nThe Dream is Rousseau's work that shows his big problem. He wanted to fit in and be accepted, or be himself and be different. This was a problem he had his whole life.",
            "Many people think there is a strong connection between what is right and wrong (ethics) and what is beautiful (aesthetics). I think there is a good reason for this. A famous writer, John Keats, once said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. That is all / You know on earth, and all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life, but we often know when something is beautiful or right without being taught. We try to explain why something is beautiful or right, but we can't always give a complete answer. Our studies of morality and beauty are not just about rules, but about understanding why something is good or beautiful. \n\nWhen people talk about why a painting or a book is good, they often use words like \"good\" or \"beautiful,\" but it's hard to describe exactly what makes it so. For example, when someone talks about the famous painting \"Mona Lisa,\" they might talk about the background or the face, but it's hard to explain why it is so special. When asked why they like a certain book or picture, people often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think that's true for both art and morality. Even if we try to explain the good qualities of a piece of art or a moral idea, there is something more to it that we can't fully explain. This \"something\" is what I think makes art and morality special.\n\nI think art and morality are connected because they both touch us deeply, even if we can't fully understand them. They are hard to explain, but we know when we experience them. This connection is especially strong when we talk about literature. Literature is a special kind of art that deals with values and what is right and wrong. We find meaning and values in literature that we can apply to our lives.",
            "The Germany of today is a strong country with a special culture. It is a mix of different parts and influences. You can feel this mix in many cities, like München near the Alps and Kiel near the Baltic Sea. The same feeling is in cities like Köln on the Rhine River and Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many different groups and tribes have lived there. The country we know today comes from these different groups.\n\nGermania is the land where the Germans come from. But where did the name \"Germania\" come from? Some people think it comes from a group called the Tungrians, who were also called Germans. They lived near the Rhine River. They fought with a group called the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" to talk about the Germanic tribes. He got this word from the Gauls. Caesar used it to talk about the tribes he had not conquered. He wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He said they lived beyond the Rhine River and fought with the Gauls all the time.\n\nOther people think the name \"Germania\" comes from a spear called a \"ger.\" Or it might come from an old Irish word that means \"to shout.\" This means the Germans were loud.\n\nA Roman historian named Tacitus wrote a book about the origins of the Germans. He said they were the original people of the area. They did not come from other places and mix with other groups. They were a separate people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They would go to Germany to trade and fight, but they did not stay. The Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire and traded with them. They also served in the Roman army.",
            "I stared down at the view in front of me. My mind was empty and blank. I looked at the picture without thinking about it. My thoughts came and went quickly. It was like my mind was watching something, but not really thinking about it. \n\nI used to want to learn how to draw. When I was a little boy, six years old, I wanted to draw. I got a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people how to draw. It says to put a square around a picture to make it simpler. This helps people see what is important. \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. I had trouble thinking about the table as a simple plane. I was too busy looking at all the details. I felt like I was seeing something amazing. \n\nMany artists, like Picasso and Monet, used different colors in their work. I wanted to be a good artist. I wanted to make something special. I named my picture \"Work in Brown.\" \n\nMy hand was moving to draw, but then it stopped. I was using the toilet. I was trying to get rid of something. It was brown and not pretty. I wanted to get rid of it. I had a mop in my hand. I was standing with my feet apart, wearing a green tie. I was not happy about the mess. \n\nI tried to clean it, but it would not go down the toilet. I got frustrated. I thought about how I must be the only one to clean the bathroom at Rite Aid. I got some toilet paper and put my hand in it. I was trying to get my hand clean. \n\nI used toilet paper to make my hand clean. It was hard to do. I had to bend down and use my hand to take out the dirty thing. It was a sad and dirty job. I was not happy about it.",
            "Many young people are killed in car accidents.  There are several reasons for this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say that one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving.  Young drivers also have little experience behind the wheel.  This causes more accidents and more bad driving.  Teens do worse when they drive with their friends.  A study in California showed that older passengers are safer.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make driving safer for teens by limiting the hours they can drive and who they can take with them.  But some think these rules are not enough.  The problem is that teens are not ready to handle the risks of driving.  A psychologist says 18 is too young to get a driver's license.  He says young people often want to take risks for fun.  It makes sense to wait until this wanting to take risks goes away.\n\nIf we give driver's licenses to young teens, we will see more accidents.  The number of people killed in car accidents will be very high.  In a few years, a lot of new drivers will be on the road.  We can make a law to solve this problem.  Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car.  A learner's permit can still be given before a full license.  People must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours.  The number of hours can be the same as most states now use.  This law would help stop teen drivers from getting hurt.\n\nThis idea is not new.  We just need to make it a national law so it helps everyone.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films. I wanted to watch all the trick films made from 1895 to 1901. There were 15 of them. These films make use of special editing to create tricks. My study focused on how these films use words and examining some special features of a few later films.\n\nMost trick films from that time are set in one place. They do not use camera movement. They use long and medium shots. They follow a rule that one shot of film equals one scene. However, some early films break these rules by using more than one shot.\n\nA common feature of trick films is that they are filmed inside a set with a front stage. The camera does not move from this position to follow actors or objects. This style comes from the theatre and magic shows. Because of this style, actors do not move towards or away from the camera. They only move from side to side.\n\nFor example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the stage. The camera does not move with them.\n\nMost trick films are long shots and, less often, medium shots. Close-up shots are not used in any of the trick films from the Edison collection. This is because the theatre and magic shows do not use close-up shots. The audience sees the whole performance at one time, framed by the stage borders.\n\nMost trick films are short, lasting about one minute or less. They often show short magic tricks, such as disappearing and switching acts with little story. However, a single shot in a trick film can be made up of several joined shots to create an illusion. For example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look shows the moment when the shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins, even though the whole film is one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, but his work in politics made him famous for his ideas about freedom and government.  He believed that farming was the best way to live.  This idea helped shape his ideas about the government and its power.  He wanted to protect and help farmers like himself.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States was lucky.  It did not have old traditions that could block the creation of a good government.  He believed people have natural rights that are very important.  These rights include freedom and the right to own property.  He thought these rights should be safe from the government.  He said that in a natural state, people with strength and bad intentions often win.  But in a civilized society, this should not be true.\n\nTo make a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should help people be good and not evil.  He believed that the government should be fair and just.  He said governments are like people – they can be good or bad.  He believed that good principles are those that protect property, help farming, and are fair to all people.  A good government would work well no matter who is in charge.  He thought people are motivated by self-interest, but this is not always bad.  It is bad when it hurts others.\n\nJohn Taylor wanted the government to follow the rules of the Constitution closely.  He wanted a small government with only the powers listed in the Constitution.  He thought a big government is expensive and can be unfair.  But he also thought that following the rules too strictly can be a problem.  He believed that the Declaration of Independence is more important than the Constitution.  It says the United States is a group of states, not just one country.",
            "There was a big drop in the number of people filling out the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a problem. It was hard to know why this happened. The winter season had started at the college. Fewer people ride bicycles or walk to school. This could be one reason for the drop. It was also the end of the fall semester. People were busy with schoolwork and finishing their grades. They may not have had time to fill out the log. The holiday season started in December. Students and teachers do not have to come to school. This means there were fewer people who needed to use the log. Classes started again in late January. But the number of log submissions was still low in February. It was hard to understand why this was. Maybe projects like this start strong and then slow down. We tried to make the project exciting again with Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special promotion. It worked and more people filled out the log in March.\n\nIt is hard to get people to change their habits. Many people like to drive their cars because it is free to do what they want, when they want. This is a big problem for projects like ours. We need to give people good reasons to change their behavior. We gave prizes to people who participated. The prizes were gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. It would be interesting to know if bigger prizes would have worked better. For example, giving away a bicycle or a car could have helped. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had given better prizes over time, that might have helped. The prizes we gave were good at first. But if we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, people might have been more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security that tracks a group of stocks, a commodity, or a basket of assets. It is more flexible than an index fund and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of diversification and single stock ownership. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy just one share. The cost of an ETF is lower than that of a mutual fund. However, you pay a commission for each trade, like with a stock. There are many ETFs available, each with its own benefits and costs.\n\nWe are looking at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of its assets. We want to know if the benefits of owning a single ETF are the same as owning a group of the 10 stocks it holds. We also want to know if there are better ways to own these stocks to get the best results.\n\nTo make it easier, we are only looking at the top 10 holdings. Here are the stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a special calculation to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's risk and return. The chart below shows the calculations.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. It also has a lower risk, or beta, of 0.12. This means it could be a good option. However, we need to make sure the difference is not just by chance.\n\nTo do this, we look at the standard deviation of each stock and compare it to the ETF. Standard deviation is a way to measure risk.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land.\" This poem is considered one of his best. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in two places. The word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil, an old Roman writer. Virgil used it to describe an island north of Britain.\n\nBut Poe got the word from another source. He liked the writing of German authors. A man named Karl J. Arndt wrote a book about Poe and another writer. Arndt said Poe copied some of this other writer's work. This other writer was Goethe.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer of Germany. He wrote a play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part came out the year Goethe died, 1832. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king who loses his wife. He starts drinking and crying. He then decides to die.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both suffer from loss and drink a lot. Goethe's \"Faust\" was also turned into a romantic play by H.P. Grattan in 1842. This was a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" He used it at the beginning and end of the poem.\n\nPoe and Goethe are connected through their writing. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a place called Thulé. It is a dark and lonely place. Poe's poem can be read as a companion to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" In Goethe's poem, the king is alone and sad. He has lost his will to rule or live.\n\nPoe admired the work of other writers. He respected Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a British writer. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of his respect for Tennyson. Many copies of Goethe's work were published after the original came out, so Poe would have seen it.",
            "Under California law, can a customer hurt in a fall on applesauce in a grocery store get extra money as punishment? This is because the store manager, Martin, was told twice about the spill and did nothing for 30 minutes to clean it up. He was eating dinner.\n\nA judge will not quickly reject Jennifer Palmer’s claim for extra money as punishment. To get this extra money, Palmer must show that Martin on purpose did something wrong that he knew would hurt someone. She must also show that his actions were very bad. Palmer can say that Martin should have known the danger of not cleaning the spill because many people slipped and fell in the store in the months before her accident. Martin knew this, but he still did nothing.\n\nPalmer can also say that Martin’s actions were very bad because six people slipped and fell in 2009 and he did not take action to keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was busy eating dinner and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill. Martin said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. Before Palmer fell, five other people had slipped and fallen at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for money to pay for her injury and for extra money as punishment.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money as punishment if the other person acted with “badness, cheating, or evil.” The law says that evil means doing something to hurt someone on purpose or doing something very bad without trying to hurt someone. Courts have said that behavior is evil when someone knows that their actions will hurt someone and they do it anyway.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at a college in Canada.  One big question in class was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this is a more important question now than ever.  Looking back at what happened since 9/11, I have seen how the media talked about Islam and extremists.  I don't think it was possible in 2001 for an American president with a Muslim background, like Barack Obama, to be elected.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad interests me.  I learned that his history is different from how I thought it was.  I used to think Muhammad forced people to become Muslims.  But his story says he was a victim.  He was humble and kind.  People came to him because they believed in his ideas.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and what Muhammad did.  One example is when he shared food with many people and there was enough for everyone.  I think the writers of his story wanted to show that Muhammad was a kind and honest person.  But this makes me think they are taking away from Jesus' teachings and trying to make Muhammad seem special.\n\nI also don't like that many stories in the biography are from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less real.  I think it's not good to use stories that are not direct.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the story tries to make Muhammad seem like a great and kind person.  But history shows that he did not act that way.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story about Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "This text is about the history of Christianity. After Jesus lived, the ideas he believed in were not followed. Instead, people moved forward with new ideas. If we look at history, we see that Christianity moved away from its start. Now, today, more people are thinking about the past and wanting to go back to the original ideas. They want to know what Jesus really said and meant.\n\nIn the future, people will become more interested in the past. They will want to know what was true about Jesus and what was not. This will take a long time, but it will happen. People will try to go back to the ideas Jesus had when he was alive. This will make Christianity return to its original form. A movement will grow and people will try to remove the new ideas that were added. They will go back to what Jesus said, not what others said later.\n\nAs this happens, the church will still be strong, but the new ideas will disappear. There will be less difference between different groups of people who believe in Christianity. They will become more alike. This is not the first time this has happened. Remember when Christians were treated badly by the Roman Empire? Later, the Roman Empire became Christian. Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly, but now they have leaders. The Christian religion will go through a big change. This change will take people back to the beginning.\n\nA way to make this happen is to look at Jesus' words as examples, not as things that must be true. So, what happened after Jesus lived?\n\nWe can look far back in history and see that there was only one religion, Judaism. This was the start of Christianity. People believed in one God and the Jewish scriptures were important. When the Romans took control of Jerusalem, the Jewish people were not all alike. They were divided into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.",
            "I think the book The Jungle shows that people are often selfish and only look out for themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. \n\nOne main way is the factory owners and managers. They want to make their factories big and powerful. They do not care about people or animals who might be hurt by their actions. The book says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky.\" This shows the big damage that factories are doing. The owners do not care about the pollution from the factories or the dirty water from the animal pens. \n\nThe owners and managers also did not care about their workers. The workers were very poor and worked in bad conditions. The factory owners would do anything to make more money. The book says, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a cauldron of hatreds and jealousies.\" This means the owners and workers did not care about each other. The workers were forced to work very long hours, and then the owners would lay them off without giving them any money or help finding a new job. \n\nIn the past, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant the factory owners and managers could do what they wanted. The workers lived in very bad conditions and were treated like slaves. The book says, \"Here is a population on the verge of starvation. They depend on the factory owners for their lives, and the owners are just as cruel as old-time slave drivers.\" This means the workers were treated very badly and had no way out of their situation.",
            "Many authors use special ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his book The Great Gatsby. He pairs words that do not usually fit together to create a certain feeling. He also gives meaning to a symbol, then uses it to create a certain feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses colors in a special way. He gives a special meaning to white and gray, and uses them to show the reader a certain feeling. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning for white and gray. White is like a nice, important color, and gray is like an old, faded color.\n\nFitzgerald shows this meaning at the beginning of the book. He says people are always wearing white. For example, Daisy and Jordan are always dressed in white. Even Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. But then Fitzgerald shows people who are not wearing white. He uses these colors to show that some people are more important and some are not.\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors for common things. He says Nick goes down \"white chasms\" when he goes to work. He says the names of people at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\". He uses these colors to show that some things are important and some are not.\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to show that some people are not important. He says Daisy is dressed in white, and people start to think of her as just a person that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this method to make readers feel a certain way about Daisy.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The climate is mild and sunny. Many types of food grow well here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a strong demand for organic food in San Diego. Many people want to buy food from local farms that use natural methods. Some farms offer tours and let visitors walk on the land. This type of farm can get government help and also make money from tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This can lead to more wildlife in the area. But organic farming can be more expensive than other types of farming. It takes more work to remove weeds and pests, and to fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Organic farms are often smaller than big farms, so they do not have the same efficiency.\n\nThe chosen land is a 160-acre area next to the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California. The land has chaparral, grass, and oak trees, and is near the Cleveland National Forest. This area is home to many types of plants and animals. Some of these animals are in danger, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople have lived on this land for a long time. First, it was Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of a original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing or wood production for many years.\n\nI looked at a real estate website to find a property, and then I researched government programs that can help small farmers. I found an organic farm in the same area that is an example of what this land might become.",
            "Culture is very important in any negotiation. What culture is and what it means can be tricky to understand. A culture is not the same everywhere or for everyone. People often think of a culture as a specific thing. But it is not. For example, saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are polite\" is not true. Every person is different. \n\nTo understand a culture, you must learn about its history, its attitudes and its values. You must not judge a culture as good or bad. You must accept it for what it is. This is especially important when you are dealing with a culture that is very different from your own.\n\nIf you are in a foreign country, you must respect its traditions and customs. You must be honest and show respect. If you are in a place where the culture is very different from your own, you must be extra careful. You can learn a lot about a culture by studying its history, its values and its customs. \n\nA company also has its own culture. This is true even in the same country. Every company is different. For example, some companies encourage people to work long hours while others give them more time off. You can see the culture of a company by looking at how its employees dress, how they communicate with each other and how they hire new people. \n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell you why people behave in certain ways. If people in a culture value harmony, they will not want to cause trouble. If people in a culture value winning, they will want to win at all costs. Understanding these values will help you in a negotiation. You must also try to learn about the person you are negotiating with. This will help you to make a good deal.",
            "The Bible says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is found in the Christian Bible and is also a point made by Thomas Aquinas. Both writers are trying to say God exists. We can compare their ideas because they both think of God as the God of the Bible.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea first. He says that God is like a truth inside our minds. We know God exists because we know God is true. Anselm thinks we don't need proof from outside to know God. This is called faith. We trust in God without needing proof.\n\nNow, let's look at St. Thomas Aquinas. He says we can know God exists through reason. We can see proof that God is real. Aquinas uses five different ideas to help us understand God. These ideas are change, causation, contingency, excellence, and harmony. He thinks that if we know the parts of something, we can know the whole. He says we can know God just by looking at the world around us.\n\nThese two writers have different ideas about how to know God. Anselm thinks faith is enough, but Aquinas thinks reason is better. We will discuss this further.",
            "A long time ago, over two thousand five hundred years, a prince was born. He would one day be called Buddha. He grew up and later rejected the world. He became very wise and his teachings formed the new religion of Buddhism. But Buddhism has changed over time. This is clear in the country of Sri Lanka, where people celebrate the annual water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is very important, but it was not taught by Buddha. It shows that Buddhism is different today than it was when Buddha was alive. This is true for many things, from small traditions to the main ideas of the religion.\n\nThis change is caused by many things, both from inside and outside Buddhism. Inside Buddhism, some people's ideas have changed over time. Outside Buddhism, other people's ideas have also made Buddhism different. Sometimes these changes are small and sometimes they are big.\n\nWe will use some special words in this discussion. Internal means a force that comes from people who believe in Buddhism. External means a force from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A hostile force is one that hurts or wants to hurt Buddhism. A benign force is one that does not want to hurt or help Buddhism.\n\nFirst, we will look at the main ideas of Buddhism. These ideas are very important. Buddhists look to three things for help: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the teachings, which include many texts. These texts are divided into three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the universe. These ideas include the idea of no soul, suffering in life, and that everything is changing.\n\nIf people understand these ideas, they can stop suffering. Suffering is a cycle of life and death. This cycle is called Sansara. When people are enlightened, they will no longer suffer from desire, hatred, and delusion. Buddhists also follow rules to live a good life. Laypeople follow five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have sex with someone you should not, and do not take too much drink. Monks and nuns follow many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries with a long history of rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The biggest problem between the two countries was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States defeated Mexico and took control of Texas and the American Southwest. Many other problems happened between the two countries. These problems ended just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans did not agree on many things, such as religion, customs, and traditions. They also had different interests. \n\nThis is like many other countries that have a long rivalry with a neighbor. Countries that share a border often have disagreements that lead to a rivalry. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with a long history of rivalry. David M. Pletcher (1977) says, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). These two countries are close to the United States and have been rivals for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States. \n\nThe two countries disagreed on religious issues. This is a problem that has happened many times in history. Sally Frahm (2001) says, “In the past, Americans were opposed to Catholicism” (p. 86). Like the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was partly about ideas and partly about what each country wanted. In this case, the ideas were about religion. The two countries did not trust each other because of the distrust between the English and Spanish. This distrust was a big problem in the early days of their relationship. \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 problems between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these problems were about territory. The United States and Mexico had many disagreements about border raids and other problems along the border. These problems did not end until both countries used their armies to control their borders. (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) says the rivalry between the two countries started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. The rivalry ended when the United States stopped trying to take more land from Mexico and instead wanted to help Mexico in other ways.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick suddenly. I was a nurse at that time. I chose nursing because my childhood was not safe. People said, \"You'll always get a job because people will always be sick.\" I wanted a safe job. My dream was to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow I am 46 years old and single. I have no money and I cannot work. To this day, I am still sick. I get money from the government because I am too sick to work. After 15 years, I have nothing. Every day is hard. I am not safe, I am not secure, and I do not like how I feel about myself.\n\nBut I know one thing is true. I would not have made it without my family and friends helping me. I was very weak when I got sick. When disaster strikes, people do not feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things will always happen. We cannot guarantee that everything will be okay. No matter how well we prepare, some things are too big for one person to handle.\n\nI agree that we should not trust the government too much. But I think we should help each other instead of relying on the government. We should learn to ask for help and to help others.\n\nThe people who built this country did not do it alone. They helped each other. They shared what they had. The people who crossed the country in wagons did not do it alone. They worked together.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and first aid supplies. But I also know my neighbors. That is the most important thing. Get to know the people who live near you. They can be your friends in hard times.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time. Are there limits that stop this change from happening? Scientists still do not fully understand this. In nineteen seventeen, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said it is hard to describe the shapes of living things using math. However, scientists are now using math to study how shells grow in certain animals.\n\nWe are studying how the shells of a certain type of animal called Prunum change over time. We are using math and experiments to understand how these changes happen. We looked at pictures of Prunum shells and used math to create models of how the shells might look. We then compared these models to real shells.\n\nA shell is a tube that grows over time. It turns in a circle, or spiral, as it grows. This spiral is made up of many round circles, called whorls. Whorls are connected by a line called a suture. The last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The tip of the spiral is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, and from the front. The most common way to look at a shell is from the side, with the front facing the viewer.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we look at it from the top and find the first line that divides the shell. We then count the whorls from this line, counting a quarter of a whorl if it is not a whole one.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a path that the animal walks through time and space as it grows its shell. We can follow this path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the whorl. We can use math to represent this path. Once we have this math, we can change the way the shell grows.",
            "Indonesia has problems with many babies dying before they are one year old and after they are born.  This has not gotten better in the last ten years.  Indonesia is working to meet its goals made in 2000.  But the country is not improving as fast as it should in the important areas of child and mother health.\n\nOne good thing is that now 72% of babies have a trained health worker helping them when they are born.  But this number still has problems.  Some of these workers are not doctors and cannot help if a problem happens during birth.  This means many women die during birth.  Indonesia is not doing enough in this area.\n\nAnother problem is that fewer children under five who get sick with diarrhea are getting help from a health worker.  We also do not have enough information about how well mothers are taking care of themselves after giving birth.\n\nFew mothers in Indonesia have a surgery called a cesarean section.  This is not good.  Even in cities, only 7% of mothers have this surgery.  In small towns, it is only 2%.  This means that many women in small towns do not have easy access to healthcare.\n\nSome people do not have healthcare services because they are too poor.  They cannot afford to pay for the help they need.  This is a big problem.\n\nSo, the big question is: how can Indonesia fix these problems?  Should the country make special programs to help one area at a time, or should it make the healthcare system better overall?  Making special programs can be good because they have clear goals and can make things happen quickly.  But making the healthcare system better can help more people and is more important in the long run.\n\nThe problem with making special programs is that they can take money and workers away from other areas of healthcare.  This can cause other problems, like making it harder for people to get the help they need.",
            "Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two novels that do not follow the normal way of Victorian novels.  Victorian novels are known for being very detailed about the lives of the wealthy people of that time.\n\nBut these two novels are different. They have mystery and strange events that make the characters more interesting. This makes us understand their feelings and reasons for doing things.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Oliver heard many confusing and scary ideas in his head. It was as if he was still talking to two men who were angry with each other. He was unsure of his body and his mind. He heard the sound of guns and people shouting. He saw lights and felt a lot of noise. He was moved quickly away from the noise. He felt pain all the time.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange events like this help us understand Oliver's feelings. These events show what hurts Oliver and what he thinks about the world around him. Later in the book, Oliver remembers the time he was shot. He remembers it like a dream. He is still in pain and does not know what to do. The pain makes him feel scared. It makes him think that he cannot control his life.\n\nOliver feels sad and helpless. He does not try to control what happens to him. This shows that Oliver does not have much control over his life. He is easily hurt by the people around him. He is hurt by Fagin, the old man who owns him.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, there is also a strange and scary time. The day was short and night was long. It was not a normal day. The night was quiet but felt very long. Some people thought that time was passing slowly.",
            "I worked with a group that helped students after school. I helped them with their studies. I worked with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I thought something was strange. Some words he could read easily, but others he could not. He spoke good English, but I was sure he was of Latino descent. I met his mother one day. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. We used a few words in Spanish to talk. I then understood the problem. Adrian was good at reading, but he did not know the alphabet. I tried to help him. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story for two reasons. First, it shows that language can be a big problem in schools. Second, it shows that the problem is not always easy to see. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We all know that this is a problem. So, what do we do? In Adrian's case, I helped him with reading. But for other children who do not speak much English, the problem is more complicated. There is no one answer. We need to use many different ways to help.\n\nOne good idea is the dual language system. This means teaching children in two languages. Not just for children who speak Spanish at home, but for all children. This system works well. Children in dual language classes do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is not worth the money. But it is true. All children would benefit from this system if we used it more. To make it work, we do not need all teachers to be bilingual. But we can have helpers who are bilingual. This can make a big difference.",

If God existed, I thought, he wasn't listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to watch my father die. I chose to remember him the way he lived, not how he died.

            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a combination of old and new ideas. Ian Watt describes it as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" Many people have different opinions about Gothic novels. Some think they are not very deep, while others think they are great. The first Gothic novel was written by Horace Walpole in 1764. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Walpole used old ideas and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story.\n\nWalpole's \"Gothic Story\" combines old and new elements. He used old theatrical ideas and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story. The Gothic genre also uses old ideas about medieval times, such as gothic architecture and traditions.\n\nWhen \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things. Some people thought it was old-fashioned and not very sophisticated. The combination of old and new ideas makes Gothic novels remain popular for a long time.\n\nOne idea that is important in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. Chivalry is a medieval idea about how to be a good knight. In \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the idea of chivalry is used to show what is good and what is not. The writers of Gothic novels, like Walpole, thought that society was not living up to the ideals of chivalry.\n\nThe character Frederic in \"The Castle of Otranto\" is a good example of chivalric ideas. He is a prince who has suffered a lot and is very polite and kind. He is an example of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that is often used in Gothic stories.\n\nThe Gothic genre is complex and has many different ideas. It uses old and new elements to create a new kind of story. Gothic novels often use chivalric ideas to show what is good and what is not. They often use old ideas about medieval times to create a new kind of story.",
            "Supply chain management is a system of processes. These processes take goods from the customer's order to the raw materials stage, then to the supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver explained how to plan, do, and control these processes to please customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts to supply chain management: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base for all the other steps. Production decides when, why, where, and how products will be made. To do this, managers must know what customers want. To find out what customers want, managers look at the market. The market is the biggest sign of what customers need. Once managers understand customer needs, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory will make them best. This helps meet customer demand and make customers happy.\n\nThe next step is for managers to plan work and take care of equipment. Production is very important. If anything goes wrong, it can cost the company time and money.\n\nSupply is the second important part of supply chain management. Supply means making strategic decisions about what a company can do well and who to partner with. A company may have many teams working on a single product. Each team has its own equipment, workers, and special skills. The manager decides which team is best for each task. The manager may also decide to work with another company to help make the product. This is called outsourcing. The goal is to be fast and flexible while saving money.",

            "Duke Ellington’s legacy in jazz music is very important. He lived a long time and was able to write many great songs. Ellington is not always on the piano in his compositions, but he was great at writing music that showed off the talents of each band member. He created a framework for soloists to improvise, and also wrote music with a clear style that fit each piece. This made his orchestra sound unique.\n\nEllington understood the sound of each player and how they worked together. He used this understanding to write some of the most innovative jazz music ever. He also used voice as a musical instrument in his music. This was something new and exciting at the time.\n\nA good example of this is his song “Creole Love Call.” In this song, Ellington uses voice in a way that adds texture and color to the music. It is a slow, twelve-bar blues song with six parts. Each part is different, and shows off the skills of the different band members.\n\nPart one is a call and response between voice and reeds. The voice begins smooth, but gets rougher at the end. Part two has a muted trumpet solo that emphasizes some sad notes. Part three has a clarinet solo that is high and exciting. Part four has the whole band playing together, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections. Part five is the most exciting part, with the reeds making the call and the brass and rhythm sections playing in a special way. Part six is like the first part, but the voice sounds like an instrument.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music in many of his songs. This was a new and interesting way to write music. He was a master of making his band sound great.\n\nIn another song, “Hot and Bothered,” Ellington uses his skill at writing tight music to make a call and response between the trumpet and voice sound rich and full. He also uses the trombone to create a new sound.\n\nEllington’s music is full of new and interesting ideas. He was a true master of jazz.",
            "She never felt complete. This feeling started when she was 14 years old. It was still there when she was 17. She knew she wanted a person, not just a thing. But she was not interested in boys. Some boys liked her, but she did not feel the same way. She wondered why this was happening. She had thought about it for many years, but could not find the answer.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm people who did not argue. They rarely argued with her, too. They just wanted her to be happy. But they worried about her independent spirit. She was a happy person with a fun personality.\n\nToday was not a peaceful day. She was looking for something to do when she heard a loud cry from the kitchen. She ran in and saw her mother on the floor in pain. Her mother was saying \"Ow\" over and over. The daughter ran to help. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked. Her mother said, \"Ouch, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The daughter helped her mother up and carried her to the car. They went to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a scary place. It smelled like sickness and medicine. But she was too worried about her mother to feel scared. She called for help and some doctors came. They put her mother on a bed and took her to see a doctor. The daughter was very worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool trying to get a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study was to see if eating a diet like the people eat in the Mediterranean area can help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.  The researchers looked at a diet called the aMed diet. It is a special diet that includes lots of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains. It also includes fish and less animal products and saturated fats.\n\nPast studies showed that people who eat the Mediterranean diet have lower risk of death from heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke. So, this study wanted to find out if the aMed diet can help lower the risk of stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 for 20 years. The women were all nurses who were part of a bigger study of 121,700 nurses in 11 states. The researchers asked the women about what they ate six times between 1984 and 2004. They used a special form to ask about their food habits. Almost all the women kept participating in the study for 20 years.\n\nThe researchers found out about heart disease and stroke cases by looking at medical records and reports. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like smoking, body weight, and exercise. To get a better idea of the women's eating habits, they averaged the scores from the food forms over two years.\n\nThe results showed that women who ate more like people in the Mediterranean area had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Women who ate the most like this had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who ate the least like this.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market crashed, and some big companies were in trouble. We ask: how did this happen and how can we stop it from happening again? In simple words, the economic problem was caused by people in power making selfish and foolish decisions. They forced banks to give out bad loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks then sold these bad loans to other companies, and when people could not pay, the banks were in trouble.\n\nThe roots of the problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular so he changed the rules to make it easier for people to get loans. This made it easy for banks to give out bad loans. In 1999, a writer for the New York Times wrote: “Fannie Mae, a company that helps people buy homes, was under pressure to give out more loans to people with little money. This could cause problems when the economy gets bad.” He said this would lead to a big problem that would need help from the government.\n\nMany things happened that made the economy get worse. Banks gave out new kinds of loans that were hard to understand. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These loans connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. This made people and banks very dependent on the housing market. When the housing market crashed, they were in big trouble.\n\nThe five biggest banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's total money. In the end, some banks went out of business and others became smaller and had to follow strict rules. Fannie and Freddie, two big companies that helped people buy homes, had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky. It's when you tell your readers a lot of information all at once, usually to explain something that happened before the story starts. This can be boring and make your readers lose interest.\n\nMany writers know the rule \"Show, don't tell.\" But even experienced writers can still get stuck in long parts of the story where nothing happens. This is called exposition. It's like a voice in your head that says, \"Let's get the history out of the way so we can get to the good parts.\"\n\nExposition is like a character telling another character a long story. It's when an author tells the reader what happened before the story starts.\n\nImagine reading a story. You are told that the main character met her husband, got married, and he was murdered. You wouldn't expect that to take two pages. You would want to see how the husband loved his wife and how she loved him. You would want to understand why his death was so important.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add \"meat\" to the story. You need to show the reader how the characters feel and what they think. You can't just tell them. You need to make them care about what's happening.\n\nIt's easy to rush past some parts of the story. But that's where the best writing happens. Take the time to show your readers what's going on. Don't just tell them. Give them something to think about and feel.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. The police arrested him. His name is Shad Hostettler. The news did not show her picture. They only spent two minutes on the story because it is still happening.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old man was shot. He is in the hospital. Nobody has been arrested yet. The police are investigating.\n\nI think the news did not give enough time to this story. If a white person had been shot, the news would have spent more time on it. But because the man is black, the news did not spend much time on it.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot by a bullet. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police want help to find the person who did it. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe news also said there will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be in the middle to low eighties. They only talked about this for a short time. They wanted to keep us watching.\n\nThe news also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road. A man robbed the store. He is black. He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. I think they talked about his color too much.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer in Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months. That is 25 years. He is Hispanic. I do not think his color is important for this story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is hard to break and is very special. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, anger, and hurt feelings. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves when they look at their brother. In bad times, the true nature of this connection is shown. When brothers feel strong emotions, they often pay a price. Part of understanding these emotions is dealing with the results of those emotions. When you look at your brother, you see a part of yourself. You see how others see you, but also how you really are. Your actions and the results of those actions show your true character.\n\nThe story of \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this connection between brothers. The two boys are very different. One is healthy and strong. The other is sick and weak. They go on a journey together. Disappointment and pride are strong feelings that come out in the end. Only one brother survives. The story shows how the strong brother feels about his little brother. He wanted a brother to play with and to teach things to. But the little brother was sick and could not do the things the strong brother wanted. The strong brother felt angry and sad. He even thought about hurting the little brother. But when the little brother smiled, the strong brother felt happy and loved him. This shows that the strong brother really loved his brother.\n\nThe story says that brothers understand each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. What brothers feel and do shows who they really are. In the story, the strong brother feels many strong feelings. He feels angry and sad, but he also feels happy and loving. The story teaches us about the connection between brothers.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and make decisions. As time passed and technology improved, people used new words to describe the brain. At first, it was like a piece of paper, then a book, and now it is like a computer. These comparisons are not very useful and can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. It changes these feelings into electrical signals. The brain uses these signals many times. It uses two ways of processing: bottom-up and top-down. Bottom-up means the brain puts simple information together. Top-down means the brain uses what it already knows to make things easier.\n\nLet's say you see a picture of a black box. Bottom-up helps you see the box's color, shape, and edges. Top-down helps you recognize it as a box. You might also think it's a black box on a white background.\n\nThe brain decides what is important and what to do with the information. This is called the attention filter. You can think about many things at the same time, but the filter helps you focus on what's important. For example, you might hear your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information. This includes three types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. The information is encoded first. It is like a code. There are different codes for different types of information. For example, when you hear words, the brain uses the words' sounds, shapes, and meanings.\n\nThe brain keeps information by using electrical signals. This signal goes between certain brain cells for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in special proteins in the brain.\n\nScientists have many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some come from computer science, and some come from studying the brain. The semantic network idea says that the brain has nodes, or points, that are connected. These points are linked because they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to the word \"table,\" which might be connected to the word \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He uses a story to show what could happen if people value community above the individual. The people in the story are told what is good for them, and they are not allowed to think for themselves.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are conditioned to be happy and not to question the government. They are told to obey the World Controller. This is not a real democracy, but a system where one person is in charge.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism by showing how people are controlled. They are not allowed to think about their relationships with others in the community. They are only interested in making money and being happy. The people at the bottom of the social ladder, called Deltas, Gammas, and others, are not free to make their own choices. They are told what to want and how to want it. This is called false consciousness.\n\nThe people at the top of the social ladder, called Alphas and Betas, know about the system, but they do not do anything to change it. They are comfortable with their place in society.\n\nHuxley also shows that people in Brave New World do not have deep relationships. They do not really know each other. They talk about each other's bodies, not about their feelings. This is not a real way to live. It is a way to keep people from thinking for themselves.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are happy to do what they are told. They do not want to be different or to question the government. This is a criticism of capitalism and how it controls people.\n\nHuxley is saying that technology and capitalism can take away people's freedom and ability to think for themselves. He is warning us about what could happen if we do not be careful.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room, which is far from the rest of the school. It takes a long time to walk from my home to classes in other parts of campus. I have to walk from Stuart Hall to the Willard building, which can take up to 25 minutes. Sometimes it's hard to walk in bad weather.\n\nI learned that a long time ago, the East Halls dorms were not connected to the rest of the school. There was empty land between them. Now, the empty space has buildings and sports fields.\n\nAs the campus grows, it's harder to move around. The best solution is to ride a bike. But a bike by itself is not enough. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be easy for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after a long time. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around.\" Riding a bike is good exercise and very efficient. You can ride 30 miles or more after eating a simple breakfast.\n\nI live off campus, which is far from the center of campus. I bought a bike and it's the smartest thing I've done this year. It takes 5 minutes to ride to Thomas building, which is where I have class. If I don't have my bike, I have to walk, which would take 30-40 minutes. That's a lot of extra time.\n\nIf I have to walk a lot, it will take over two and a half hours every week. That's too much time for me. I'm too busy. A bike helps me save time and be more efficient."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I also want to help families who are having problems.\n\nThe values I will bring to this job are important. They include helping others, treating people with respect, being honest, and working hard to improve myself so I can help people better. These values are important to me, not just for my job, but also for my life.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. But I was not sure what job I wanted. In high school and college, I saw many people avoid their problems and some made bad choices. This made me think about a career in Psychology. But I was still not sure. So I took a break after I finished college in 2009.\n\nOne day that summer, I visited a friend. She had a 16-year-old boy visiting her. He was very nervous. She told me why he was there - to escape his mean parents. The next day, I went to the parents' house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and explained that I was a psychologist. They asked me to talk to the parents. When I asked them about the boy, they seemed nervous and made excuses. This made me think about how I could help children like this boy.\n\nI also care about social justice. We say that each person is important, but we often want to be like everyone else. I am different and I do not want to be limited by what others think. In high school and college, I stood up for what I believed in. I wore clothes that were my style, I had bright hair colors, and I spoke out against racism and unfairness. I will continue to stand up for what I believe in.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The first way is called the biological model. This model looks at things like genes and medical problems that can affect sleep. The second way is called the sociocultural model. This model looks at how sleep is affected by things like race, income, and where people live.\n\nThe biological model studies how genes and medical problems can affect sleep. For example, a study with mice found that special molecules called orexin help regulate sleep and wakefulness. The study showed that a certain kind of receptor in the brain called GABAB can affect sleep. The researchers found that a special medicine called baclofen can help mice sleep. This means that the research on mice can help us understand how sleep works in humans.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how sleep is affected by things like where people live and how much money they have. If people inherit a problem with their GABAB receptors, it can affect their sleep. This can make it hard to do everyday tasks like going to school or work.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem that can be caused by different things. It can be a primary sleep disorder, which means it is a sleep problem on its own. Or it can be caused by another mental health problem. Insomnia can also be caused by medical problems or taking certain substances.\n\nThere are different types of sleep disorders, including insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and others. Insomnia is when a person has trouble sleeping, and hypersomnia is when a person has trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that involves falling asleep suddenly.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how things like race, income, and where people live can affect sleep. For example, some people may have trouble sleeping because of stress or because they do not have a comfortable place to sleep.\n\nThis paper will look at the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the research.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we will explain what the disorder is. Next, we will discuss how to diagnose it. Finally, we will talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. The brain cannot process sound correctly. People with CAPD can hear normally, but have trouble with things like understanding what is said in a noisy room. They can hear, but their brain does not work correctly to help them understand.\n\nThe first time people talked about CAPD was in the 1950s. They called it “auditory imperception.” Researchers started testing children with communication problems back then. In 1954, an Italian team developed tests for children with these problems. In 1961, a scientist named Kimura created a way to test how the brain works when we hear two things at the same time.\n\nCAPD makes it hard for people to do several things. They may have trouble knowing where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sound. They may not be able to tell when someone is being sarcastic. One sound can block out another sound. They may not be able to understand how to use sounds to do things. And they may not be able to tell when sounds are in the right order.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a person must be tested. This can be done by a specialist who listens to what the person does and how they respond to different sounds. There is no single test that can diagnose CAPD. Many tests ask the person to do things like listen to a series of words or numbers. Some tests also record the sounds in the ear and see how the person responds.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that disguises can be useful, but they can also cause problems. If a person hides their true identity for too long, they may lose themselves. Ending a deception can also be difficult. It may cause people to be angry or sad. They may feel hurt because they were tricked.\n\nDisguises can also cause problems in relationships. For example, in Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself. She is very good at pretending, but it makes her feel alone. She is not close to the women around her. This causes her more problems.\n\nViola's disguise also causes confusion. People think she is a man named Sebastian. Another woman, Olivia, falls in love with the wrong person. This is a big problem.\n\nThe play also shows how disguises can help people hide their true feelings. For example, Olivia and Orsino, two main characters, seem to have hidden feelings for each other. But they do not act on these feelings because Viola is pretending to be a man. When Viola's disguise is discovered, it makes Olivia and Orsino face their hidden feelings.\n\nSome people think that Olivia's feelings for Viola were not real. They think she was just attracted to Viola because she thought she was a man. But Olivia's behavior is also suspicious. She quickly stops loving Viola and starts to love the \"real\" Sebastian. This shows that Olivia may be making fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThe play is saying that disguises can be complicated and cause problems. People must decide between being true to themselves and keeping their relationships. It is not always easy.",
            "German colonial rule was very bad. The Germans were very cruel to the Ovaherero and Nama people in South West Africa. This is just one example. The German colonial empire was different in many ways. It had different rules and leaders in different places. The education system was also different in different colonies. When the British took control of Tanganyika (East Africa) in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. Germans did good work in Kamerun and other colonies, according to writers at that time.\n\nBut in South West Africa, the situation was very bad. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach Africans. In South West Africa, the government did not help very much. Missionary groups taught many Africans, but they did not have much money or help from the government. The government spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in the colony. They made sure Europeans had good education. These education policies lasted a long time in South West Africa. Other German colonies had many Africans who could read and write. But in South West Africa, most people were not educated.\n\nThere are many books and articles about education in the German colonial empire. Many of these are in German and were written a long time ago. These books mainly described the education systems in the colonies. Later, writers in English wrote more about education in the German colonies. They compared education in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. One important book is by Cohen, who studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen says the number of white settlers in South West Africa made the education system in this colony different.\n\nSouth West Africa has a mild climate, but it is also a desert. Many Europeans lived there because it was a good place to live. In 1913, over 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 lived in East Africa, which had the next largest number of European settlers.",
            "Many kinds of music are part of the Popular Music group. This group has changed a lot in the last 100 years. New kinds of music are being added every year. Most kinds of music have broken down into smaller groups. For example, rock music has many smaller groups like heavy metal.\n\nHeavy metal music is one of the most interesting kinds of music. It shows many different feelings, but usually it is dark and sad. People who make heavy metal music started to make their own kinds of music. This started a chain of new kinds of music. Now there are many kinds of heavy metal.\n\nIt is hard to say what heavy metal is. Many kinds of music have joined it. But it started from something. To understand heavy metal music, you must know where it came from.\n\nHeavy metal is a kind of music that is dark. It is loud and has a lot of beat. People who make heavy metal music are very good at their instruments. They show this in their music. Heavy metal music is also often about complicated feelings and is influenced by drugs. Many people used psychedelic drugs in the 1970s. This led to new and strange music. Heavy metal music has many dark qualities. It shows feelings that most music does not show.\n\nHeavy metal has taken some of its ideas from the Romantic Era. This era was very emotional and sad. Many heavy metal songs are about these strong feelings. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a famous heavy metal song. It shows the darker side of the Beatles. This song was a response to another song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau painted his dream. But his dream was not just in the painting. It was also his own dream as an artist. The Dream, a painting from nineteen ten, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a magical place in her dream. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be recognized and admired by other artists and people who love art. But he had a big problem. He had to choose between being like other artists and being himself.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know something about his life. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, eighteen forty-four, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a businessman. Rousseau grew up without any formal training in art. He worked for many years until he was forty. He was an employee of the government, collecting taxes at the border. People sometimes called him a customs inspector.\n\nRousseau's first wife died when their eight babies were young. He was left with one daughter, Julia, and a lot of sadness. He wanted a new life. He started painting to find comfort. Rousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful pictures of peasants. He was a folk painter. He painted about common people like himself.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. He was not educated in art, and he started painting late in life. Many other artists were famous and well-known during that time. Rousseau did not get recognition until Matisse became famous. A writer said that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a special way to avoid being boring. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as a good artist.\n\nThe Dream is Rousseau's work that shows his big problem. He wanted to fit in and be accepted, or be himself and be different. This was a problem he had his whole life.",
            "Many people think there is a strong connection between what is right and wrong (ethics) and what is beautiful (aesthetics). I think there is a good reason for this. A famous writer, John Keats, once said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. That is all / You know on earth, and all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life, but we often know when something is beautiful or right without being taught. We try to explain why something is beautiful or right, but we can't always give a complete answer. Our studies of morality and beauty are not just about rules, but about understanding why something is good or beautiful. \n\nWhen people talk about why a painting or a book is good, they often use words like \"good\" or \"beautiful,\" but it's hard to describe exactly what makes it so. For example, when someone talks about the famous painting \"Mona Lisa,\" they might talk about the background or the face, but it's hard to explain why it is so special. When asked why they like a certain book or picture, people often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think that's true for both art and morality. Even if we try to explain the good qualities of a piece of art or a moral idea, there is something more to it that we can't fully explain. This \"something\" is what I think makes art and morality special.\n\nI think art and morality are connected because they both touch us deeply, even if we can't fully understand them. They are hard to explain, but we know when we experience them. This connection is especially strong when we talk about literature. Literature is a special kind of art that deals with values and what is right and wrong. We find meaning and values in literature that we can apply to our lives.",
            "The Germany of today is a strong country with a special culture. It is a mix of different parts and influences. You can feel this mix in many cities, like München near the Alps and Kiel near the Baltic Sea. The same feeling is in cities like Köln on the Rhine River and Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many different groups and tribes have lived there. The country we know today comes from these different groups.\n\nGermania is the land where the Germans come from. But where did the name \"Germania\" come from? Some people think it comes from a group called the Tungrians, who were also called Germans. They lived near the Rhine River. They fought with a group called the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" to talk about the Germanic tribes. He got this word from the Gauls. Caesar used it to talk about the tribes he had not conquered. He wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He said they lived beyond the Rhine River and fought with the Gauls all the time.\n\nOther people think the name \"Germania\" comes from a spear called a \"ger.\" Or it might come from an old Irish word that means \"to shout.\" This means the Germans were loud.\n\nA Roman historian named Tacitus wrote a book about the origins of the Germans. He said they were the original people of the area. They did not come from other places and mix with other groups. They were a separate people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They would go to Germany to trade and fight, but they did not stay. The Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire and traded with them. They also served in the Roman army.",
            "I stared down at the view in front of me. My mind was empty and blank. I looked at the picture without thinking about it. My thoughts came and went quickly. It was like my mind was watching something, but not really thinking about it. \n\nI used to want to learn how to draw. When I was a little boy, six years old, I wanted to draw. I got a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people how to draw. It says to put a square around a picture to make it simpler. This helps people see what is important. \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. I had trouble thinking about the table as a simple plane. I was too busy looking at all the details. I felt like I was seeing something amazing. \n\nMany artists, like Picasso and Monet, used different colors in their work. I wanted to be a good artist. I wanted to make something special. I named my picture \"Work in Brown.\" \n\nMy hand was moving to draw, but then it stopped. I was using the toilet. I was trying to get rid of something. It was brown and not pretty. I wanted to get rid of it. I had a mop in my hand. I was standing with my feet apart, wearing a green tie.

I had to bend down and use my hand to take out the dirty thing. It was a sad and dirty job. I was not happy about it.",
            "Many young people are killed in car accidents.  There are several reasons for this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say that one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving.  Young drivers also have little experience behind the wheel.  This causes more accidents and more bad driving.  Teens do worse when they drive with their friends.  A study in California showed that older passengers are safer.\n\nCalifornia and other states try to make driving safer for teens by limiting the hours they can drive and who they can take with them.  But some think these rules are not enough.  The problem is that teens are not ready to handle the risks of driving.  A psychologist says 18 is too young to get a driver's license.  He says young people often want to take risks for fun.  It makes sense to wait until this wanting to take risks goes away.\n\nIf we give driver's licenses to young teens, we will see more accidents.  The number of people killed in car accidents will be very high.  In a few years, a lot of new drivers will be on the road.  We can make a law to solve this problem.  Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car.  A learner's permit can still be given before a full license.  People must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours.  The number of hours can be the same as most states now use.  This law would help stop teen drivers from getting hurt.\n\nThis idea is not new.  We just need to make it a national law so it helps everyone.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films. I wanted to watch all the trick films made from 1895 to 1901. There were 15 of them. These films make use of special editing to create tricks. My study focused on how these films use words and examining some special features of a few later films.\n\nMost trick films from that time are set in one place. They do not use camera movement. They use long and medium shots. They follow a rule that one shot of film equals one scene. However, some early films break these rules by using more than one shot.\n\nA common feature of trick films is that they are filmed inside a set with a front stage. The camera does not move from this position to follow actors or objects. This style comes from the theatre and magic shows. Because of this style, actors do not move towards or away from the camera. They only move from side to side.\n\nFor example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the stage. The camera does not move with them.\n\nMost trick films are long shots and, less often, medium shots. Close-up shots are not used in any of the trick films from the Edison collection. This is because the theatre and magic shows do not use close-up shots. The audience sees the whole performance at one time, framed by the stage borders.\n\nMost trick films are short, lasting about one minute or less. They often show short magic tricks, such as disappearing and switching acts with little story. However, a single shot in a trick film can be made up of several joined shots to create an illusion. For example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look shows the moment when the shot with Mary's \"severed head\" begins, even though the whole film is one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republicanism.  He was a farmer, but his work in politics made him famous for his ideas about freedom and government.  He believed that farming was the best way to live.  This idea helped shape his ideas about the government and its power.  He wanted to protect and help farmers like himself.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States was lucky.  It did not have old traditions that could block the creation of a good government.  He believed people have natural rights that are very important.  These rights include freedom and the right to own property.  He thought these rights should be safe from the government.  He said that in a natural state, people with strength and bad intentions often win.  But in a civilized society, this should not be true.\n\nTo make a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should help people be good and not evil.  He believed that the government should be fair and just.  He said governments are like people – they can be good or bad.  He believed that good principles are those that protect property, help farming, and are fair to all people.  A good government would work well no matter who is in charge.  He thought people are motivated by self-interest, but this is not always bad.  It is bad when it hurts others.\n\nJohn Taylor wanted the government to follow the rules of the Constitution closely.  He wanted a small government with only the powers listed in the Constitution.  He thought a big government is expensive and can be unfair.  But he also thought that following the rules too strictly can be a problem.  He believed that the Declaration of Independence is more important than the Constitution.  It says the United States is a group of states, not just one country.",
            "There was a big drop in the number of people filling out the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a problem. It was hard to know why this happened. The winter season had started at the college. Fewer people ride bicycles or walk to school. This could be one reason for the drop. It was also the end of the fall semester. People were busy with schoolwork and finishing their grades. They may not have had time to fill out the log. The holiday season started in December. Students and teachers do not have to come to school. This means there were fewer people who needed to use the log. Classes started again in late January. But the number of log submissions was still low in February. It was hard to understand why this was. Maybe projects like this start strong and then slow down. We tried to make the project exciting again with Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special promotion. It worked and more people filled out the log in March.\n\nIt is hard to get people to change their habits. Many people like to drive their cars because it is free to do what they want, when they want. This is a big problem for projects like ours. We need to give people good reasons to change their behavior. We gave prizes to people who participated. The prizes were gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. It would be interesting to know if bigger prizes would have worked better. For example, giving away a bicycle or a car could have helped. We did not change the prizes during the project. If we had given better prizes over time, that might have helped. The prizes we gave were good at first. But if we had announced bigger prizes in December and January, people might have been more interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a security that tracks a group of stocks, a commodity, or a basket of assets. It is more flexible than an index fund and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of diversification and single stock ownership. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy just one share. The cost of an ETF is lower than that of a mutual fund. However, you pay a commission for each trade, like with a stock. There are many ETFs available, each with its own benefits and costs.\n\nWe are looking at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of its assets. We want to know if the benefits of owning a single ETF are the same as owning a group of the 10 stocks it holds. We also want to know if there are better ways to own these stocks to get the best results.\n\nTo make it easier, we are only looking at the top 10 holdings. Here are the stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a special calculation to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's risk and return. The chart below shows the calculations.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. It also has a lower risk, or beta, of 0.12. This means it could be a good option. However, we need to make sure the difference is not just by chance.\n\nTo do this, we look at the standard deviation of each stock and compare it to the ETF. Standard deviation is a way to measure risk.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land.\" This poem is considered one of his best. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in two places. The word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil, an old Roman writer. Virgil used it to describe an island north of Britain.\n\nBut Poe got the word from another source. He liked the writing of German authors. A man named Karl J. Arndt wrote a book about Poe and another writer. Arndt said Poe copied some of this other writer's work. This other writer was Goethe.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer of Germany. He wrote a play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part came out the year Goethe died, 1832. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king who loses his wife. He starts drinking and crying. He then decides to die.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. They both suffer from loss and drink a lot. Goethe's \"Faust\" was also turned into a romantic play by H.P. Grattan in 1842. This was a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" He used it at the beginning and end of the poem.\n\nPoe and Goethe are connected through their writing. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a place called Thulé. It is a dark and lonely place. Poe's poem can be read as a companion to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" In Goethe's poem, the king is alone and sad. He has lost his will to rule or live.\n\nPoe admired the work of other writers. He respected Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a British writer. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of his respect for Tennyson. Many copies of Goethe's work were published after the original came out, so Poe would have seen it.",
            "Under California law, can a customer hurt in a fall on applesauce in a grocery store get extra money as punishment? This is because the store manager, Martin, was told twice about the spill and did nothing for 30 minutes to clean it up. He was eating dinner.\n\nA judge will not quickly reject Jennifer Palmer’s claim for extra money as punishment. To get this extra money, Palmer must show that Martin on purpose did something wrong that he knew would hurt someone. She must also show that his actions were very bad. Palmer can say that Martin should have known the danger of not cleaning the spill because many people slipped and fell in the store in the months before her accident. Martin knew this, but he still did nothing.\n\nPalmer can also say that Martin’s actions were very bad because six people slipped and fell in 2009 and he did not take action to keep the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was busy eating dinner and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill. Martin said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. Before Palmer fell, five other people had slipped and fallen at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for money to pay for her injury and for extra money as punishment.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money as punishment if the other person acted with “badness, cheating, or evil.” The law says that evil means doing something to hurt someone on purpose or doing something very bad without trying to hurt someone. Courts have said that behavior is evil when someone knows that their actions will hurt someone and they do it anyway.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at a college in Canada.  One big question in class was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this is a more important question now than ever.  Looking back at what happened since 9/11, I have seen how the media talked about Islam and extremists.  I don't think it was possible in 2001 for an American president with a Muslim background, like Barack Obama, to be elected.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad interests me.  I learned that his history is different from how I thought it was.  I used to think Muhammad forced people to become Muslims.  But his story says he was a victim.  He was humble and kind.  People came to him because they believed in his ideas.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and what Muhammad did.  One example is when he shared food with many people and there was enough for everyone.  I think the writers of his story wanted to show that Muhammad was a kind and honest person.  But this makes me think they are taking away from Jesus' teachings and trying to make Muhammad seem special.\n\nI also don't like that many stories in the biography are from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less real.  I think it's not good to use stories that are not direct.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the story tries to make Muhammad seem like a great and kind person.  But history shows that he did not act that way.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story about Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "This text is about the history of Christianity. After Jesus lived, the ideas he believed in were not followed. Instead, people moved forward with new ideas. If we look at history, we see that Christianity moved away from its start. Now, today, more people are thinking about the past and wanting to go back to the original ideas. They want to know what Jesus really said and meant.\n\nIn the future, people will become more interested in the past. They will want to know what was true about Jesus and what was not. This will take a long time, but it will happen. People will try to go back to the ideas Jesus had when he was alive. This will make Christianity return to its original form. A movement will grow and people will try to remove the new ideas that were added. They will go back to what Jesus said, not what others said later.\n\nAs this happens, the church will still be strong, but the new ideas will disappear. There will be less difference between different groups of people who believe in Christianity. They will become more alike. This is not the first time this has happened. Remember when Christians were treated badly by the Roman Empire? Later, the Roman Empire became Christian. Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly, but now they have leaders. The Christian religion will go through a big change. This change will take people back to the beginning.\n\nA way to make this happen is to look at Jesus' words as examples, not as things that must be true. So, what happened after Jesus lived?\n\nWe can look far back in history and see that there was only one religion, Judaism. This was the start of Christianity. People believed in one God and the Jewish scriptures were important. When the Romans took control of Jerusalem, the Jewish people were not all alike. They were divided into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.",
            "I think the book The Jungle shows that people are often selfish and only look out for themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. \n\nOne main way is the factory owners and managers. They want to make their factories big and powerful. They do not care about people or animals who might be hurt by their actions. The book says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky.\" This shows the big damage that factories are doing. The owners do not care about the pollution from the factories or the dirty water from the animal pens. \n\nThe owners and managers also did not care about their workers. The workers were very poor and worked in bad conditions. The factory owners would do anything to make more money. The book says, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a cauldron of hatreds and jealousies.\" This means the owners and workers did not care about each other. The workers were forced to work very long hours, and then the owners would lay them off without giving them any money or help finding a new job. \n\nIn the past, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant the factory owners and managers could do what they wanted. The workers lived in very bad conditions and were treated like slaves. The book says, \"Here is a population on the verge of starvation. They depend on the factory owners for their lives, and the owners are just as cruel as old-time slave drivers.\" This means the workers were treated very badly and had no way out of their situation.",
            "Many authors use special ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these methods in his book The Great Gatsby. He pairs words that do not usually fit together to create a certain feeling. He also gives meaning to a symbol, then uses it to create a certain feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses colors in a special way. He gives a special meaning to white and gray, and uses them to show the reader a certain feeling. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning for white and gray. White is like a nice, important color, and gray is like an old, faded color.\n\nFitzgerald shows this meaning at the beginning of the book. He says people are always wearing white. For example, Daisy and Jordan are always dressed in white. Even Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. But then Fitzgerald shows people who are not wearing white. He uses these colors to show that some people are more important and some are not.\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors for common things. He says Nick goes down \"white chasms\" when he goes to work. He says the names of people at Gatsby's parties are \"gray names\". He uses these colors to show that some things are important and some are not.\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses white and gray to show that some people are not important. He says Daisy is dressed in white, and people start to think of her as just a person that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this method to make readers feel a certain way about Daisy.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The climate is mild and sunny. Many types of food grow well here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a strong demand for organic food in San Diego. Many people want to buy food from local farms that use natural methods. Some farms offer tours and let visitors walk on the land. This type of farm can get government help and also make money from tours and educational programs.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This can lead to more wildlife in the area. But organic farming can be more expensive than other types of farming. It takes more work to remove weeds and pests, and to fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Organic farms are often smaller than big farms, so they do not have the same efficiency.\n\nThe chosen land is a 160-acre area next to the town of Potrero in San Diego County, California. The land has chaparral, grass, and oak trees, and is near the Cleveland National Forest. This area is home to many types of plants and animals. Some of these animals are in danger, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople have lived on this land for a long time. First, it was Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of a original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing or wood production for many years.\n\nI looked at a real estate website to find a property, and then I researched government programs that can help small farmers. I found an organic farm in the same area that is an example of what this land might become.",
            "Culture is very important in any negotiation. What culture is and what it means can be tricky to understand. A culture is not the same everywhere or for everyone. People often think of a culture as a specific thing. But it is not. For example, saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are polite\" is not true. Every person is different. \n\nTo understand a culture, you must learn about its history, its attitudes and its values. You must not judge a culture as good or bad. You must accept it for what it is. This is especially important when you are dealing with a culture that is very different from your own.\n\nIf you are in a foreign country, you must respect its traditions and customs. You must be honest and show respect. If you are in a place where the culture is very different from your own, you must be extra careful. You can learn a lot about a culture by studying its history, its values and its customs. \n\nA company also has its own culture. This is true even in the same country. Every company is different. For example, some companies encourage people to work long hours while others give them more time off. You can see the culture of a company by looking at how its employees dress, how they communicate with each other and how they hire new people. \n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell you why people behave in certain ways. If people in a culture value harmony, they will not want to cause trouble. If people in a culture value winning, they will want to win at all costs. Understanding these values will help you in a negotiation. You must also try to learn about the person you are negotiating with. This will help you to make a good deal.",
            "The Bible says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is found in the Christian Bible and is also a point made by Thomas Aquinas. Both writers are trying to say God exists. We can compare their ideas because they both think of God as the God of the Bible.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea first. He says that God is like a truth inside our minds. We know God exists because we know God is true. Anselm thinks we don't need proof from outside to know God. This is called faith. We trust in God without needing proof.\n\nNow, let's look at St. Thomas Aquinas. He says we can know God exists through reason. We can see proof that God is real. Aquinas uses five different ideas to help us understand God. These ideas are change, causation, contingency, excellence, and harmony. He thinks that if we know the parts of something, we can know the whole. He says we can know God just by looking at the world around us.\n\nThese two writers have different ideas about how to know God. Anselm thinks faith is enough, but Aquinas thinks reason is better. We will discuss this further.",
            "A long time ago, over two thousand five hundred years, a prince was born. He would one day be called Buddha. He grew up and later rejected the world. He became very wise and his teachings formed the new religion of Buddhism. But Buddhism has changed over time. This is clear in the country of Sri Lanka, where people celebrate the annual water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is very important, but it was not taught by Buddha. It shows that Buddhism is different today than it was when Buddha was alive. This is true for many things, from small traditions to the main ideas of the religion.\n\nThis change is caused by many things, both from inside and outside Buddhism. Inside Buddhism, some people's ideas have changed over time. Outside Buddhism, other people's ideas have also made Buddhism different. Sometimes these changes are small and sometimes they are big.\n\nWe will use some special words in this discussion. Internal means a force that comes from people who believe in Buddhism. External means a force from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A hostile force is one that hurts or wants to hurt Buddhism. A benign force is one that does not want to hurt or help Buddhism.\n\nFirst, we will look at the main ideas of Buddhism. These ideas are very important. Buddhists look to three things for help: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the teachings, which include many texts. These texts are divided into three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the universe. These ideas include the idea of no soul, suffering in life, and that everything is changing.\n\nIf people understand these ideas, they can stop suffering. Suffering is a cycle of life and death. This cycle is called Sansara. When people are enlightened, they will no longer suffer from desire, hatred, and delusion. Buddhists also follow rules to live a good life. Laypeople follow five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have sex with someone you should not, and do not take too much drink. Monks and nuns follow many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico are two countries with a long history of rivalry. This rivalry lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The biggest problem between the two countries was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. In this war, the United States defeated Mexico and took control of Texas and the American Southwest. Many other problems happened between the two countries. These problems ended just before World War I. The rivalry started because Americans and Mexicans did not agree on many things, such as religion, customs, and traditions. They also had different interests. \n\nThis is like many other countries that have a long rivalry with a neighbor. Countries that share a border often have disagreements that lead to a rivalry. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with a long history of rivalry. David M. Pletcher (1977) says, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). These two countries are close to the United States and have been rivals for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States. \n\nThe two countries disagreed on religious issues. This is a problem that has happened many times in history. Sally Frahm (2001) says, “In the past, Americans were opposed to Catholicism” (p. 86). Like the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico was partly about ideas and partly about what each country wanted. In this case, the ideas were about religion. The two countries did not trust each other because of the distrust between the English and Spanish. This distrust was a big problem in the early days of their relationship. \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 problems between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these problems were about territory. The United States and Mexico had many disagreements about border raids and other problems along the border. These problems did not end until both countries used their armies to control their borders. (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) says the rivalry between the two countries started to end when Mexico became dependent on the United States. The rivalry ended when the United States stopped trying to take more land from Mexico and instead wanted to help Mexico in other ways.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick suddenly. I was a nurse at that time. I chose nursing because my childhood was not safe. People said, \"You'll always get a job because people will always be sick.\" I wanted a safe job. My dream was to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow I am 46 years old and single. I have no money and I cannot work. To this day, I am still sick. I get money from the government because I am too sick to work. After 15 years, I have nothing. Every day is hard. I am not safe, I am not secure, and I do not like how I feel about myself.\n\nBut I know one thing is true. I would not have made it without my family and friends helping me. I was very weak when I got sick. When disaster strikes, people do not feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things will always happen. We cannot guarantee that everything will be okay. No matter how well we prepare, some things are too big for one person to handle.\n\nI agree that we should not trust the government too much. But I think we should help each other instead of relying on the government. We should learn to ask for help and to help others.\n\nThe people who built this country did not do it alone. They helped each other. They shared what they had. The people who crossed the country in wagons did not do it alone. They worked together.\n\nBy all means, be prepared.

            "We want to know why living things change over time. Are there limits that stop this change from happening? Scientists still do not fully understand this. In nineteen seventeen, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said it is hard to describe the shapes of living things using math. However, scientists are now using math to study how shells grow in certain animals.\n\nWe are studying how the shells of a certain type of animal called Prunum change over time. We are using math and experiments to understand how these changes happen. We looked at pictures of Prunum shells and used math to create models of how the shells might look. We then compared these models to real shells.\n\nA shell is a tube that grows over time. It turns in a circle, or spiral, as it grows. This spiral is made up of many round circles, called whorls. Whorls are connected by a line called a suture. The last whorl, or body whorl, is the largest. The tip of the spiral is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, and from the front. The most common way to look at a shell is from the side, with the front facing the viewer.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we look at it from the top and find the first line that divides the shell. We then count the whorls from this line, counting a quarter of a whorl if it is not a whole one.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a path that the animal walks through time and space as it grows its shell. We can follow this path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the whorl. We can use math to represent this path. Once we have this math, we can change the way the shell grows.",
            "Indonesia has problems with many babies dying before they are one year old and after they are born.  This has not gotten better in the last ten years.  Indonesia is working to meet its goals made in 2000.  But the country is not improving as fast as it should in the important areas of child and mother health.\n\nOne good thing is that now 72% of babies have a trained health worker helping them when they are born.  But this number still has problems.  Some of these workers are not doctors and cannot help if a problem happens during birth.  This means many women die during birth.  Indonesia is not doing enough in this area.\n\nAnother problem is that fewer children under five who get sick with diarrhea are getting help from a health worker.  We also do not have enough information about how well mothers are taking care of themselves after giving birth.\n\nFew mothers in Indonesia have a surgery called a cesarean section.  This is not good.  Even in cities, only 7% of mothers have this surgery.  In small towns, it is only 2%.  This means that many women in small towns do not have easy access to healthcare.\n\nSome people do not have healthcare services because they are too poor.  They cannot afford to pay for the help they need.  This is a big problem.\n\nSo, the big question is: how can Indonesia fix these problems?  Should the country make special programs to help one area at a time, or should it make the healthcare system better overall?  Making special programs can be good because they have clear goals and can make things happen quickly.  But making the healthcare system better can help more people and is more important in the long run.\n\nThe problem with making special programs is that they can take money and workers away from other areas of healthcare.  This can cause other problems, like making it harder for people to get the help they need.",
            "Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two novels that do not follow the normal way of Victorian novels.  Victorian novels are known for being very detailed about the lives of the wealthy people of that time.\n\nBut these two novels are different. They have mystery and strange events that make the characters more interesting. This makes us understand their feelings and reasons for doing things.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Oliver heard many confusing and scary ideas in his head. It was as if he was still talking to two men who were angry with each other. He was unsure of his body and his mind. He heard the sound of guns and people shouting. He saw lights and felt a lot of noise. He was moved quickly away from the noise. He felt pain all the time.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange events like this help us understand Oliver's feelings. These events show what hurts Oliver and what he thinks about the world around him. Later in the book, Oliver remembers the time he was shot. He remembers it like a dream. He is still in pain and does not know what to do. The pain makes him feel scared. It makes him think that he cannot control his life.\n\nOliver feels sad and helpless. He does not try to control what happens to him. This shows that Oliver does not have much control over his life. He is easily hurt by the people around him. He is hurt by Fagin, the old man who owns him.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, there is also a strange and scary time. The day was short and night was long. It was not a normal day.

            "I worked with a group that helped students after school. I helped them with their studies. I worked with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I thought something was strange. Some words he could read easily, but others he could not. He spoke good English, but I was sure he was of Latino descent. I met his mother one day. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. We used a few words in Spanish to talk. I then understood the problem. Adrian was good at reading, but he did not know the alphabet. I tried to help him. I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story for two reasons. First, it shows that language can be a big problem in schools. Second, it shows that the problem is not always easy to see. Even if a child speaks good English, reading can still be hard. We all know that this is a problem. So, what do we do? In Adrian's case, I helped him with reading. But for other children who do not speak much English, the problem is more complicated. There is no one answer. We need to use many different ways to help.\n\nOne good idea is the dual language system. This means teaching children in two languages. Not just for children who speak Spanish at home, but for all children. This system works well. Children in dual language classes do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it is not worth the money. But it is true. All children would benefit from this system if we used it more. To make it work, we do not need all teachers to be bilingual. But we can have helpers who are bilingual. This can make a big difference.",

If God existed, I thought, he wasn't listening to me.\n\nI didn't want to watch my father die. I chose to remember him the way he lived, not how he died.

            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a combination of old and new ideas. Ian Watt describes it as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" Many people have different opinions about Gothic novels. Some think they are not very deep, while others think they are great. The first Gothic novel was written by Horace Walpole in 1764. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Walpole used old ideas and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story.\n\nWalpole's \"Gothic Story\" combines old and new elements. He used old theatrical ideas and new ways of writing to create a new kind of story. The Gothic genre also uses old ideas about medieval times, such as gothic architecture and traditions.\n\nWhen \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things. Some people thought it was old-fashioned and not very sophisticated. The combination of old and new ideas makes Gothic novels remain popular for a long time.\n\nOne idea that is important in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. Chivalry is a medieval idea about how to be a good knight. In \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the idea of chivalry is used to show what is good and what is not. The writers of Gothic novels, like Walpole, thought that society was not living up to the ideals of chivalry.\n\nThe character Frederic in \"The Castle of Otranto\" is a good example of chivalric ideas. He is a prince who has suffered a lot and is very polite and kind. He is an example of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that is often used in Gothic stories.\n\nThe Gothic genre is complex and has many different ideas. It uses old and new elements to create a new kind of story. Gothic novels often use chivalric ideas to show what is good and what is not. They often use old ideas about medieval times to create a new kind of story.",
            "Supply chain management is a system of processes. These processes take goods from the customer's order to the raw materials stage, then to the supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver. Keith Oliver explained how to plan, do, and control these processes to please customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six important parts to supply chain management: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base for all the other steps. Production decides when, why, where, and how products will be made. To do this, managers must know what customers want. To find out what customers want, managers look at the market. The market is the biggest sign of what customers need. Once managers understand customer needs, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory will make them best. This helps meet customer demand and make customers happy.\n\nThe next step is for managers to plan work and take care of equipment. Production is very important. If anything goes wrong, it can cost the company time and money.\n\nSupply is the second important part of supply chain management. Supply means making strategic decisions about what a company can do well and who to partner with. A company may have many teams working on a single product. Each team has its own equipment, workers, and special skills. The manager decides which team is best for each task. The manager may also decide to work with another company to help make the product. This is called outsourcing. The goal is to be fast and flexible while saving money.",

            "Duke Ellington’s legacy in jazz music is very important. He lived a long time and was able to write many great songs. Ellington is not always on the piano in his compositions, but he was great at writing music that showed off the talents of each band member. He created a framework for soloists to improvise, and also wrote music with a clear style that fit each piece. This made his orchestra sound unique.\n\nEllington understood the sound of each player and how they worked together. He used this understanding to write some of the most innovative jazz music ever. He also used voice as a musical instrument in his music. This was something new and exciting at the time.\n\nA good example of this is his song “Creole Love Call.” In this song, Ellington uses voice in a way that adds texture and color to the music. It is a slow, twelve-bar blues song with six parts. Each part is different, and shows off the skills of the different band members.\n\nPart one is a call and response between voice and reeds. The voice begins smooth, but gets rougher at the end. Part two has a muted trumpet solo that emphasizes some sad notes. Part three has a clarinet solo that is high and exciting. Part four has the whole band playing together, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections. Part five is the most exciting part, with the reeds making the call and the brass and rhythm sections playing in a special way. Part six is like the first part, but the voice sounds like an instrument.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music in many of his songs. This was a new and interesting way to write music. He was a master of making his band sound great.\n\nIn another song, “Hot and Bothered,” Ellington uses his skill at writing tight music to make a call and response between the trumpet and voice sound rich and full. He also uses the trombone to create a new sound.\n\nEllington’s music is full of new and interesting ideas. He was a true master of jazz.",
            "She never felt complete. This feeling started when she was 14 years old. It was still there when she was 17. She knew she wanted a person, not just a thing. But she was not interested in boys. Some boys liked her, but she did not feel the same way. She wondered why this was happening. She had thought about it for many years, but could not find the answer.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm people who did not argue. They rarely argued with her, too. They just wanted her to be happy. But they worried about her independent spirit. She was a happy person with a fun personality.\n\nToday was not a peaceful day. She was looking for something to do when she heard a loud cry from the kitchen. She ran in and saw her mother on the floor in pain. Her mother was saying \"Ow\" over and over. The daughter ran to help. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked. Her mother said, \"Ouch, sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The daughter helped her mother up and carried her to the car. They went to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a scary place. It smelled like sickness and medicine. But she was too worried about her mother to feel scared. She called for help and some doctors came. They put her mother on a bed and took her to see a doctor. The daughter was very worried.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool trying to get a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study was to see if eating a diet like the people eat in the Mediterranean area can help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.  The researchers looked at a diet called the aMed diet. It is a special diet that includes lots of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains. It also includes fish and less animal products and saturated fats.\n\nPast studies showed that people who eat the Mediterranean diet have lower risk of death from heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke. So, this study wanted to find out if the aMed diet can help lower the risk of stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63 for 20 years. The women were all nurses who were part of a bigger study of 121,700 nurses in 11 states. The researchers asked the women about what they ate six times between 1984 and 2004. They used a special form to ask about their food habits. Almost all the women kept participating in the study for 20 years.\n\nThe researchers found out about heart disease and stroke cases by looking at medical records and reports. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like smoking, body weight, and exercise. To get a better idea of the women's eating habits, they averaged the scores from the food forms over two years.\n\nThe results showed that women who ate more like people in the Mediterranean area had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Women who ate the most like this had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who ate the least like this.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market crashed, and some big companies were in trouble. We ask: how did this happen and how can we stop it from happening again? In simple words, the economic problem was caused by people in power making selfish and foolish decisions. They forced banks to give out bad loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks then sold these bad loans to other companies, and when people could not pay, the banks were in trouble.\n\nThe roots of the problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular so he changed the rules to make it easier for people to get loans. This made it easy for banks to give out bad loans. In 1999, a writer for the New York Times wrote: “Fannie Mae, a company that helps people buy homes, was under pressure to give out more loans to people with little money. This could cause problems when the economy gets bad.” He said this would lead to a big problem that would need help from the government.\n\nMany things happened that made the economy get worse. Banks gave out new kinds of loans that were hard to understand. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These loans connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. This made people and banks very dependent on the housing market. When the housing market crashed, they were in big trouble.\n\nThe five biggest banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's total money. In the end, some banks went out of business and others became smaller and had to follow strict rules. Fannie and Freddie, two big companies that helped people buy homes, had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky. It's when you tell your readers a lot of information all at once, usually to explain something that happened before the story starts. This can be boring and make your readers lose interest.\n\nMany writers know the rule \"Show, don't tell.\" But even experienced writers can still get stuck in long parts of the story where nothing happens. This is called exposition. It's like a voice in your head that says, \"Let's get the history out of the way so we can get to the good parts.\"\n\nExposition is like a character telling another character a long story. It's when an author tells the reader what happened before the story starts.\n\nImagine reading a story. You are told that the main character met her husband, got married, and he was murdered. You wouldn't expect that to take two pages. You would want to see how the husband loved his wife and how she loved him. You would want to understand why his death was so important.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add \"meat\" to the story. You need to show the reader how the characters feel and what they think. You can't just tell them. You need to make them care about what's happening.\n\nIt's easy to rush past some parts of the story. But that's where the best writing happens. Take the time to show your readers what's going on. Don't just tell them. Give them something to think about and feel.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio. He stabbed his wife. The police arrested him. His name is Shad Hostettler. The news did not show her picture. They only spent two minutes on the story because it is still happening.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. An 18-year-old man was shot. He is in the hospital. Nobody has been arrested yet. The police are investigating.\n\nI think the news did not give enough time to this story. If a white person had been shot, the news would have spent more time on it. But because the man is black, the news did not spend much time on it.\n\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot by a bullet. It was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police want help to find the person who did it. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward.\n\nThe news also said there will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be in the middle to low eighties. They only talked about this for a short time. They wanted to keep us watching.\n\nThe news also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road. A man robbed the store. He is black. He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. I think they talked about his color too much.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer in Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months. That is 25 years. He is Hispanic. I do not think his color is important for this story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. This connection is hard to break and is very special. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, anger, and hurt feelings. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves when they look at their brother. In bad times, the true nature of this connection is shown. When brothers feel strong emotions, they often pay a price. Part of understanding these emotions is dealing with the results of those emotions. When you look at your brother, you see a part of yourself. You see how others see you, but also how you really are. Your actions and the results of those actions show your true character.\n\nThe story of \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this connection between brothers. The two boys are very different. One is healthy and strong. The other is sick and weak. They go on a journey together. Disappointment and pride are strong feelings that come out in the end. Only one brother survives. The story shows how the strong brother feels about his little brother. He wanted a brother to play with and to teach things to. But the little brother was sick and could not do the things the strong brother wanted. The strong brother felt angry and sad. He even thought about hurting the little brother. But when the little brother smiled, the strong brother felt happy and loved him. This shows that the strong brother really loved his brother.\n\nThe story says that brothers understand each other very well. They can see themselves in each other. What brothers feel and do shows who they really are. In the story, the strong brother feels many strong feelings. He feels angry and sad, but he also feels happy and loving. The story teaches us about the connection between brothers.",
            "The human brain is a very complex system. It helps us think and make decisions. As time passed and technology improved, people used new words to describe the brain. At first, it was like a piece of paper, then a book, and now it is like a computer. These comparisons are not very useful and can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. It changes these feelings into electrical signals. The brain uses these signals many times. It uses two ways of processing: bottom-up and top-down. Bottom-up means the brain puts simple information together. Top-down means the brain uses what it already knows to make things easier.\n\nLet's say you see a picture of a black box. Bottom-up helps you see the box's color, shape, and edges. Top-down helps you recognize it as a box. You might also think it's a black box on a white background.\n\nThe brain decides what is important and what to do with the information. This is called the attention filter. You can think about many things at the same time, but the filter helps you focus on what's important. For example, you might hear your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information. This includes three types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. The information is encoded first. It is like a code. There are different codes for different types of information. For example, when you hear words, the brain uses the words' sounds, shapes, and meanings.\n\nThe brain keeps information by using electrical signals. This signal goes between certain brain cells for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in special proteins in the brain.\n\nScientists have many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some come from computer science, and some come from studying the brain. The semantic network idea says that the brain has nodes, or points, that are connected. These points are linked because they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to the word \"table,\" which might be connected to the word \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He uses a story to show what could happen if people value community above the individual. The people in the story are told what is good for them, and they are not allowed to think for themselves.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are conditioned to be happy and not to question the government. They are told to obey the World Controller. This is not a real democracy, but a system where one person is in charge.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism by showing how people are controlled. They are not allowed to think about their relationships with others in the community. They are only interested in making money and being happy. The people at the bottom of the social ladder, called Deltas, Gammas, and others, are not free to make their own choices. They are told what to want and how to want it. This is called false consciousness.\n\nThe people at the top of the social ladder, called Alphas and Betas, know about the system, but they do not do anything to change it. They are comfortable with their place in society.\n\nHuxley also shows that people in Brave New World do not have deep relationships. They do not really know each other. They talk about each other's bodies, not about their feelings. This is not a real way to live. It is a way to keep people from thinking for themselves.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are happy to do what they are told. They do not want to be different or to question the government. This is a criticism of capitalism and how it controls people.\n\nHuxley is saying that technology and capitalism can take away people's freedom and ability to think for themselves. He is warning us about what could happen if we do not be careful.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room, which is far from the rest of the school. It takes a long time to walk from my home to classes in other parts of campus. I have to walk from Stuart Hall to the Willard building, which can take up to 25 minutes. Sometimes it's hard to walk in bad weather.\n\nI learned that a long time ago, the East Halls dorms were not connected to the rest of the school. There was empty land between them. Now, the empty space has buildings and sports fields.\n\nAs the campus grows, it's harder to move around. The best solution is to ride a bike. But a bike by itself is not enough. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be easy for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after a long time. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around.\" Riding a bike is good exercise and very efficient. You can ride 30 miles or more after eating a simple breakfast.\n\nI live off campus, which is far from the center of campus. I bought a bike and it's the smartest thing I've done this year. It takes 5 minutes to ride to Thomas building, which is where I have class. If I don't have my bike, I have to walk, which would take 30-40 minutes. That's a lot of extra time.\n\nIf I have to walk a lot, it will take over two and a half hours every week. That's too much time for me. I'm too busy. A bike helps me save time and be more efficient."
