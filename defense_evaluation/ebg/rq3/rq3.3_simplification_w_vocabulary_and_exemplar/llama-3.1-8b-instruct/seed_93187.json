            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Finally, the paper will finish with ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a disorder of the brain. The brain cannot properly use the information it gets from hearing. People with CAPD can hear normally. They are not deaf. The problem is the brain does not work right to understand what is heard. It is not easy for them to understand words or to tell the difference between what is being said and background noise.\n\nCAPD was first mentioned in the 1950s. At that time, researchers were studying children with communication problems. They found some children could not understand what was said to them. They could not tell where sounds were coming from. They could not understand speech patterns. They could not understand changes in voice. One sound could cover up another sound. They could not understand the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors and special teachers use tests. They watch how the person behaves and how they respond to sounds. They ask questions and give tests to see if the person can tell the difference between sounds. There is no single test that can say for sure if someone has CAPD. There is no known cause for the disorder.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom. The teacher can make sure the student sits near the front of the classroom. The teacher can make sure the student can see the teacher's face when they talk. The teacher can ask the student to repeat what they say. The teacher can help the student to listen to one sound at a time. The teacher can help the student to understand what is being said by giving them extra time to listen. The teacher can give the student help when they are working on reading and writing. The teacher can help the student to listen to instructions and to follow them.",

Most of these studies were written by Germans in the early 1900s. Later studies in English compared education in different colonies and looked at specific problems. These studies showed that each colony was different.\n\nA well-known study compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. The author, Cohen, said that the large number of European settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the differences in their educational systems. \n\nSouth West Africa was a good place for Europeans to live. The climate was not very hot, and many Europeans moved there. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. East Africa had fewer Europeans, with only 5,336.",
            "Heavy Metal Music: A Dark and Diverse Movement\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHeavy metal music has grown much since its beginning about a hundred years ago. Today, it is difficult to make a full list of its many kinds. Many of its main kinds, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have created many smaller kinds within themselves. One of the most interesting kinds of heavy metal is its sub-genre, which is known for its many different emotions. Heavy metal music often expresses sad or unhappy feelings. It is also very different because people can make many kinds of music within it. They do this by using different instruments and ways of singing.\n\nHeavy metal music has many different kinds of music within it. Some people like to make music that is very loud and strong. Others like to make music that is more gentle and quiet. Many people like to make music that combines heavy metal with other kinds of music. This makes it hard to say exactly what heavy metal is today. To understand heavy metal music, we need to know what it started from and why it is a movement, not just a kind of music.\n\nHeavy metal music is a movement that is known for being dark. It is like a \"more\" music - it has more loud music, more strong sounds, and more acting out. Heavy metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments, and this shows in their music. Heavy metal music also comes from people who have used drugs. In the 1970s, there was a time when many people used psychedelic drugs, and this led to the creation of new and crazy kinds of music. Heavy metal music has many qualities that are true to the darker side of life. Some of its qualities come from the Romantic Era, a time when people made many sad and emotional works of art. Some famous lyrics of heavy metal music express its dark and emotional side. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a well-known heavy metal song. It shows the darker side of life, like the effects of using drugs. This song was made in response to a song by the Rolling Stones that was also very heavy and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was just as strong and emotional as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau: A Dream of Recognition\n\nHenri Rousseau was a famous French painter. He created many paintings that showed his dreams and hopes. One of his most famous paintings is \"The Dream.\" It shows a woman who is very happy in a beautiful place. But \"The Dream\" is not just about the woman. It is also about Rousseau's own dreams and struggles.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a good painter. He wanted other artists and people to like his work. But he had a problem. He did not know if he should be like other artists or be himself. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not want to copy others.\n\nTo understand \"The Dream,\" we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in a small town in France on May 21, 1844. His father was a successful businessman. Rousseau grew up and worked for the government until he was 40. He did not go to art school, but he started painting when he was older.\n\nRousseau's life was not easy. He lost his first wife and eight children. He was very sad. He started painting to feel better. Rousseau's paintings are different from the paintings of other famous artists. He painted simple things that he knew and loved.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. But it was hard for him. Many other artists were already famous. He did not get recognition until later, when another artist named Matisse was becoming famous too. Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and exciting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as a good artist.\n\nRousseau's painting \"The Dream\" shows his struggles. He wanted to be a good painter, but he was not sure how to do it. He wanted to be accepted, but he did not want to copy others. His painting is a dream, but it is also a reflection of his own hopes and fears.",
            "Many people think that ethics and beauty are connected. I agree with them. I believe that at a basic level, there is a reason for this connection. John Keats wrote, \"Beauty is truth. That is all you need to know.\" Much of what we know in life is from learning or experience. However, we seem to understand ethics and beauty in a way that is not taught. Both ethics and beauty are attempts to describe, not to tell people what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are about explaining why something is beautiful or right, not about making rules for what is good or beautiful.\n\nFor example, when we talk about a work of art, like the Mona Lisa, we talk about things like color, contrast, and background. But these do not explain why the painting is good. When people talk about their favorite work of art, they often say \"There's something about it\" before explaining it in more detail. I believe that both art and morality cannot be fully explained. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that cannot be said any other way.\" No matter how well we describe a work of art, there is something more that remains unexplained.\n\nMorality and art are connected because we experience them in the same way. They affect us at a deep level that cannot be fully explained. This is especially true for literature. Literature is special because it has a moral quality. It is connected to our values in life.",
            "Germany today is a strong country with its own unique culture. This culture can be seen in many places, from the Alps in the south to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea in the north. People in cities like Köln and Dresden show this culture. Germany is different from other countries because it was made from many different tribes and groups.\n\nThe land where German people came from is called Germania. The name Germany comes from a group of people called the Germanic tribes. One historian, Tacitus, wrote about these tribes two thousand years ago. He said they were from a place called Tungria and were known as Germans before they moved to a new area near the Rhine River. They fought battles with other groups, called the Gauls.\n\nAnother historian, Julius Caesar, wrote about the German people in his book about the Gallic Wars. He heard the word \"Germanus\" from the Gauls, who used it to describe their neighbors. They used this word to show the difference between the people they fought and the people they did not fight.\n\nThere are different ideas about where the name Germany came from. Some people think it came from a spear that the German people used in battle. Others think it came from an old Irish word that means \"to shout,\" because the German people were known to be loud.\n\nA long time ago, Tacitus wrote about the origins of the German people. He said they were the original people of the area and did not mix with other groups. He asked, \"Why would anyone leave a warm and comfortable place to live in a cold and difficult land like Germany?\" He thought it would be a hard choice, and it might be true that the Romans did not want to live in Germany.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire and traded with them. They gave the Romans goods from their land and worked for the Romans in their army. This was in the first century AD.",
            "I stared down at the picture before me. I was not thinking about it in a big way. I was just looking at it. My mind was working hard, but I was not thinking about what it all meant. I was just seeing the things in front of me.\n\nI learned to draw from a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. It teaches how to see and how to draw. One thing it says to do is to put a square around the picture you are looking at. This helps make it simpler.\n\nBut at that moment, I was too busy being surprised. I could not think about the picture like that. I was just looking at it and feeling amazed.\n\nI wanted to be a good artist. I wanted to make something like the pictures of famous artists. They used different colors and shapes to make their pictures. \n\nI picked up my pencil and started to draw. My hand moved and my mind was working hard. But then I remembered why I was there. I had to clean the bathroom. There was a big mess in the toilet. I grabbed a mop and tried to clean it up. But it was hard. The bad smell was strong.\n\nI stood up and took a deep breath. I made a big effort and tried to clean the toilet again. This time I used a special tool to help me. I was very careful and patient. Finally, I was able to clean the mess.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many things come together to make this a big problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers also have little experience behind the wheel. This causes more accidents and problems like vehicles turning over, driving too fast, and leaving the road.\n\nTeenagers also do worse when they drive with their friends. Most teenagers drive with friends, and it is well known that this is a bad idea. A study in California found that the age of the passenger and the number of car accidents are related.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make driving safer for teens by giving them temporary licenses with rules. But these rules are not enough. The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers and responsibilities of driving. A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young to get a driver's license. He has done research that shows young people want to take risks for the fun of it. This is why we should delay giving driver's licenses to teens until they are older. If we do not, many more teenagers will die in car accidents.\n\nWe can fix this problem with a law. Schools can teach people how to drive before they get a license. But nobody under 18 can drive a car. We can still give permits to teens before giving them a full license. They will need to practice driving with a grown-up for a certain number of hours. We can use the same number of hours that most states require. This is a simple and good way to keep teenagers safe.\n\nThis idea is not new. It would be a good law to make all states follow.",
            "I looked at old films made by Thomas Edison. These films were made from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen trick films. These films use editing to make things seem real but not true. I studied these films to understand their special tricks. I wanted to know how they work and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of these early trick films take place in a single room and do not move the camera. The film is like a stage play. The actors enter and leave from the side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. In one film called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, the actors come in from the right and move side to side.\n\nThe films usually show the actors from head to foot. Sometimes they show the actors from the waist up. But they never show just their face. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. In plays and vaudeville shows, the audience sees the entire performance. They do not see just one part of the action.\n\nMost of these early trick films are short. They last about a minute or less. They show simple tricks like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes one \"shot\" is really several shots joined together to make an illusion. In a trick film, what we see may not be real. Look closely at a film called The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. We see something that looks like Mary's head being cut off. But it is really several shots joined together.",
            "John Taylor was a well-known supporter of the Republican Party. He was a farmer and had a short time in politics. Taylor was known for speaking his mind on personal freedom and government. He thought farming was the best job, and this belief guided his ideas about the government. He wanted to keep and help farming. This idea affected his thoughts on independence, the Constitution, and the court system.\n\nTaylor believed America had a chance to create a perfect system of government. There was no established tradition in the country, so the people who created the government could make a good system. He believed in the idea of natural rights. He said these rights are connected and if one is taken away, the others are less valuable. He believed the government should not control these rights.\n\nTaylor said that in a natural state, people with power and bad intentions profit. But in a civilized society, this should not be true. He wanted a government that considers the good and bad in people. Taylor believed that a good government protects private property, helps farming, and does not support capitalism. He thought a government with good principles would work well, even with different leaders. He believed self-interest is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it causes harm to others.\n\nTaylor wanted a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He wanted the federal government to have only the powers listed in the Constitution. He thought a strong federal government would be expensive and likely to be unfair. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation could be wrong and might lead to corruption. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution because it clearly states that the United States is a group of independent states.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people who submitted information about their commutes in the third month of the project. This was not good news, and we could not understand why it happened. Winter was coming to a campus in New England, so fewer people were walking or biking to school. This might be part of the reason for the drop. December is a busy time for students and teachers to finish their work and get grades. Maybe they just forgot to submit the forms. The holiday season also started in December. Many students and teachers went home for a month and did not need to come to school. Classes started again in late January, but that did not make up for the low numbers in February. People might get excited about a new project at first and then lose interest. To keep people involved, we created Carpool Challenge Week. It was a special week in March to try and get people to start commuting again. This worked and more people submitted their forms that month.\n\nOne problem was that people like driving their cars. It is a part of our culture. To get people to change, we needed to give them something. We gave away gift cards to local stores and restaurants. This helped, but it would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have worked better. For example, we could have given away a new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project.\n\nWe did not change the prizes during the project. Maybe we should have made them bigger over time. The gift cards were good at first, but more prizes might have helped keep people involved. We thought about this after it happened.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security. It follows an index, a product, or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. \n\nAn ETF gives you the benefits of many stocks and the power to make trades like a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin and buy one share if you want. These benefits are attractive. But the cost of ETFs is lower than for the average investment fund. \n\nHowever, there are some downsides. You have to pay a fee for each trade like you do for a stock. There are also many types of ETFs to choose from. But it is a good idea to check if the benefits of an ETF are real. \n\nFor this project, we will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to know if owning one ETF is good or if it is better to own a group of 10 stocks. We will also check if there is a better way to combine these stocks to get a higher return.\n\nWe cannot include all the stocks in the ETF. So, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the fund. Here are the top 10 stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a chart. The chart shows the percentage of each stock and how much it affects the portfolio's risk and return. We want to see if the 10 stocks are a good choice.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks can give a higher return than the ETF. The return is 6.11% higher. The risk of the portfolio is also lower. The risk, or beta, is 0.12 lower than the ETF.\n\nIt seems that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks can give a higher return with less risk. But we need to check if these results are real. We will look at the standard deviation of each stock. This will help us see if the two portfolios are different.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is a famous work. In this poem, the word \"Thulé\" is used twice. Poe got this word from the ancient writer Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain.\n\nThere is another source for this word. Poe liked reading German writers. He was interested in a writer named Goethe. Goethe was known for his poem \"Faust.\" This poem was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king whose wife dies. He drinks a lot and cries because he misses his wife. He then decides to die and gives his things to his children. He throws a special cup into the ocean and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" is similar to the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" Both are sad and lonely. They both have a dark world around them. This is similar to the scene in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in his collected writings. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he wrote \"ultma Thule.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" he used it twice, at the beginning and end of the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. They describe a sad and lonely world.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer. Poe would have known about him because he liked another writer, Tennyson. Poe said he admired Tennyson.

            "California Law and Punitive Damages\nUnder California law, can a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get extra punishment money from the store manager? The store manager was eating dinner when he was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes.\n\nA judge is unlikely to reject the customer's claim for extra money. To get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted with a bad intention and did not care about the harm that could happen. The customer must also show that the store manager's actions were very bad.\n\nThe customer can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill would be bad because many customers had slipped and fallen on the same thing before. Even though the store manager knew this, he still did not clean the spill.\n\nIt is not clear if the customer's actions were very bad. However, it is possible to say that they were bad because the store manager did not take care of the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee told the store manager about the applesauce spill. The manager said he did not have time to deal with the problem. Another employee also told the manager about the spill, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt.\n\nBefore the customer's accident, five other customers had slipped and fallen at the store in 2009. Now the customer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury. We are looking at whether to ask the court to throw out the part of the lawsuit that asks for extra money.\n\nIn California, a customer can get extra money if the store manager acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice means acting with a bad intention or doing something very bad on purpose. If the store manager did not act with a bad intention, but his actions were very bad and he did not care about the harm that could happen, the customer may still get extra money.\n\nA court has said that conduct is malicious when the person knows that their actions could cause harm and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC.  A big question in our class was: Is Islam a hostile religion? I think this question is even more important now than before.  Since 9/11, I have seen the media change from being against Islam to being very friendly.  In 2001, a presidential candidate with a Muslim background would not have been elected. \n\nI find the story of the Prophet interesting.  His biography says he was a kind and humble man.  But this does not fit what I thought I knew about him.  I thought he forced people to join Islam.  He would win battles and then make other people join his religion.  But the biography says he was a kind leader.  People came to him because they believed in him.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad made food for many people and there was still enough.  This way of writing makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to seem like a kind and special person.  But it makes me think they are trying to take away from Jesus. \n\nI also do not like that many stories in the biography are not from direct witnesses.  The stories are from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI have a problem with the biography because it makes Muhammad seem like a perfect and kind person.  But history says he was not that way.  I think Muslims should know the truth about Muhammad's past.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and what he believed in were left behind in the growth of Christian thought after his death. If we look at the history of Christianity, we see a trend of it moving away from its beginnings. It seems that today, more people are becoming aware and thinking in a more modern way.  Most of the population still believes in traditional ideas and will not accept new thoughts. But those who know about history will become more aware in the future. They will want to know about the ideas that were added to Christianity and compare them to what Jesus really said. This will take a long time, but it will happen. People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus. They will remove the ideas that were added later. It will be like turning back time. Finally, people will follow the ideas of Jesus as if it were his time. The church will still be strong, but people will think and believe the same way.\n\nThis is not the first time something like this happened. Many years ago, Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire. But the empire later became Christian. Our country used to be against African-Americans, but now we have African-American leaders. Something similar will happen with Christianity. It will go back to its beginning and people will think the same way. This will happen because people will start to see Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact words. If we go back in time, we see that there was only one main idea: Judaism. It was the main idea that started Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem, in 63 B.C.E., the Jews had many different ideas. They were divided into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots.",

They do not care if their actions hurt people or animals.\n\nThe factories are very dirty and make a lot of pollution. The smoke from the factories goes high into the air and hurts people and animals. The owners also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They make the workers work very long hours and pay them very little. The workers have no protection and are treated very badly.\n\nThe book says that the workers in these factories are like slaves. They have no money and no choices. They are forced to live in poor conditions and work in bad factories. The owners and managers are very powerful and do not care about the workers.\n\nThe Jungle shows us that people in charge often think only about themselves and their money. They do not think about the people who are less fortunate and need help.",
            "Many writers use different ways to make their readers feel a certain way about important subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby. He pairs words together to make readers feel a certain way about a subject. Some times he uses a word and a color, but they do not usually go together. He uses this to make readers remember a feeling when they see the color later.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with many colors. He gives meaning to colors like gold, green, white, and red. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning of white and gray. He makes white a nice color and gray an old color. He starts this in the beginning of the book. Many people are always wearing white. They include Daisy and Jordan. People also wear white when they are important. Nick wears white clothes to a party. Tom wears a white shirt to meet Myrtle.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe everyday things. He makes readers see these colors in many things. People are in white when they are young. Old people are in gray. He makes readers see these colors in many things like houses, cars, and even dogs. When people are important, they are in white. When people are old, they are in gray.\n\nAfter he makes the meaning clear, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show readers that some things are not important. He does this with a character named Daisy. He stops using white and gray for a while. Then he uses them again to make readers see Daisy as not special. She wears a white dress to a party. He also writes about her fur having a gray color. He makes her seem like just a person, not a special person.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique a lot in the book. He makes readers see colors and remember how they feel.

            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many kinds of crops grow here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. People in the area like to buy food from local farms. There is a big demand for organic food from these farms. Many people are on a waiting list to buy from these farms. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Some farms give tours and let people walk on the land to see the wildlife.\n\nOrganic farming can be good for the land and the animals. It does not use chemicals that can harm the soil and water. But organic farming is more expensive than farming with chemicals. It needs more work and money to remove weeds and pests and to make the soil healthy. A small organic farm is not as efficient as a big farm. It also costs more to plant cover crops and to control the growth of plants.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. This land is next to the Cleveland National Forest. The plan for the area considers over a hundred kinds of plants and animals. Some of these plants and animals are in danger of disappearing. Others are getting fewer in number and may soon be in danger.\n\nThis land was home to Native Americans many years ago. After that, it was used for grazing cattle and for cutting wood. The land was part of a small farm a long time ago.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a piece of land like this. I also looked at government programs to see what a small farmer could do to make farming cheaper and better for the wildlife. I used a local organic farm as an example of what someone farming this land might try to do.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. Culture is not one thing, and it is not the same everywhere. It is not uniform and it is not the same for everyone. We should not say things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too broad and too simple.\n\nWhen we talk about a culture, we should think about what it means and how it will affect the talks. We should try to understand the culture, not judge it or try to change it. We can do this by learning about its history and its values. We should respect the culture and its traditions, especially if we are in a weak position.\n\nWe should also remember that culture is not just about countries. Companies have their own culture. For example, a company might expect employees to work long hours or have a relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire.\n\nValues are also important. Values tell us why people do things. If saving face is important in a culture, a negotiator will not want to make their company or leader look bad. If a culture values a strong bargain, a negotiator will not want to agree too quickly. Knowing these things can help us be a better negotiator.\n\nIt is also important to learn about the person we are negotiating with. This can help us make the talks more effective.",
            "A long time ago, a wise person in the Bible wrote, \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is similar to the thoughts of two other important thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. They both try to prove the existence of God. To compare their ideas, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible.\n\nWe will look at the ideas of St. Anselm first. He says that we can find the truth about God inside our own minds. He thinks that if we think about God, we will understand that God must exist. This idea is based on faith. Faith is trusting in something that we can't prove with facts.\n\nNow, let's look at the ideas of Thomas Aquinas. He thinks that we can prove the existence of God using reason and facts. He doesn't believe in faith. Instead, he uses five different kinds of logic to show that God must exist. These kinds of logic are change, cause and effect, something being possible or not possible, levels of perfection, and harmony.\n\nFor example, if you have a puzzle and you know you are missing one piece, you can figure out what the missing piece must look like without seeing it. This is similar to how Aquinas uses logic to show that God must exist.\n\nWhile both Anselm and Aquinas make good points, neither of them gives us a complete idea of why God must exist. We can only understand their ideas fully by accepting their point of view. However, this can make it difficult to compare their ideas because they are based on different kinds of thinking.",
            "A long time ago – about two thousand five hundred years ago – a famous teacher named Buddha was born. He was a prince at the time. Later in life, he gave up his life of luxury and found a deeper meaning. This led to the creation of Buddhism, a major world religion. Over time, Buddhism has changed and looks different today from how it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in the country of Sri Lanka. It is a Theravada nation where a special ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony is held every year. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, which has some spiritual meaning. But Buddha did not teach about any holiday like this.\n\nThere are many differences between the way Buddhism was in the past and the way it is now. These differences come from inside the Buddhist community and from outside. The Buddhist community has had to change its teachings over time because of these forces.\n\nThere are some important words to know for this discussion. \"Internal\" means something that comes from inside the Buddhist community. \"External\" means something that comes from outside. \"Hostile\" means something that harms the Buddhist community. \"Benign\" means something that does not harm or help the Buddhist community.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basic ideas of Buddhism – the ideas that are important to the religion. Buddhists seek help and protection from three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a set of teachings. It includes a collection of texts called the Tripitaka. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has speeches, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and the universe. Important ideas include Anatta – there is no soul, Dukkha – life is suffering, and Anicca – everything is always changing. When you understand these ideas, you can end the cycle of death and rebirth, which is called Sansara. You will also end lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion. For this to happen, you must become enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for how to live your life. For non-monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have sex with someone you are not married to, and do not take drugs. For monks, there are many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted 57 years.  It started in 1836 and ended in 1893.  They had many problems during this time.  The worst time was the Mexican-American War.  The United States attacked and defeated Mexico.  This war happened from 1846 to 1848.  The United States then got Texas and the Southwest as new land.  They had other fights, but they stopped before World War I.  The two countries had many differences.  They disagreed on things like religion, culture, and way of life.  They also had different ideas about what was important.  This is common when two countries share a border.  They often fight over things like land and resources.\n\nThis is like many other countries that fight with their neighbors.  The United States and Mexico are not alone.  Other countries near the United States have had good relationships.  This is true for the United States and other countries in Latin America.  Many countries have had problems with each other because of their beliefs.  In the past, Americans were against the Catholic Church and monarchies.  This is like the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.  But the United States and Mexico's problems were about religion, not politics.  They got these feelings from their past colonial rulers, the English and Spanish.  This made it hard for them to be friends.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had 17 problems during this time.  Most of them were about land and the border.  There were fights over border raids and other frontier problems.  The United States and Mexico had to use their armies to stop these problems.  As time went on, Mexico became more dependent on the United States.  This helped the rivalry end.  The United States stopped trying to take land from Mexico and started to help the country economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with a sickness I knew nothing about. I was a nurse at the time. I chose nursing to feel safe and secure. Many people told me this job would always be available because people will always be sick.\n\nMy dream was to be a scientist or journalist. But I chose nursing. Now I am 46 years old and unable to work. I get money from the government, but it is not enough. I have no money of my own. Every day is a struggle.\n\nI am grateful to my family and friends for their help. Without them, I would not have made it. When disaster strikes, you do not feel strong. My point is that disasters can happen in life. We cannot prepare for everything.\n\nWe need to stop relying on big government. But instead of building shelters, we should learn to trust each other. We should help one another and ask for help when we need it.\n\nConservatives talk about rugged individualism, but our ancestors did not succeed alone. They had compassion, respect, and shared their resources. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagons did not make it alone.\n\nBe prepared. I have a kit with first aid supplies and food. I also have a plan for a disaster. But it is also important to know your neighbors. Get to know them and ask for help if you need it.",
            "Scientists want to know why living things change over time. Are there rules that help decide what kind of changes happen? Although a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said in 1917 that it is hard to use math to understand simple living things, scientists are now using math to study how certain animals grow and change. They are studying a group of animals called mollusks. Our study is looking at how math can help us understand how these animals change as they grow.\n\nWe used a special kind of X-ray picture to study the shells of these animals. We made numbers from these pictures that can be used to make models of the shells. We used a computer program to make these models. We used the models to make predictions about what the shells might look like. We are combining this with other studies to learn more about how these animals changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space. It turns in a circle around a center point. This center point is like a line that runs through the middle of the shell. The shell has many circles, called whorls, that grow as the animal gets bigger. The whorls are like layers that add to the shell. The last circle is the biggest circle and is called the body whorl. The other circles are called the spire. The spire is all the circles except the last one.\n\nWe can look at a shell in different ways. We can look at it from the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. The front is the usual way to look at a shell. When we look at a shell, we can count the circles. We start by looking at the shell from the top and finding the first line between two circles. We draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. We count the circles from this line. We can count them by a quarter of a circle.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can make a map of this path using numbers. We can use this map to change the way the shell grows. Once we have a map, we can change the numbers to see what happens to the shell.",
            "Indonesia's rate of baby and child death in the first year of life has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in many areas, like water and sanitation, but it is not making progress fast enough in child and mother health.  The country still has a long way to go to meet its target goals by 2015.\n\nThere are many reasons for this slow progress.  We will look at these reasons below.  They show that Indonesia needs to improve its health system, not just specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some improvement in the number of births where a trained health worker is present.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  However, this includes traditional workers like midwives who do not have the training to help in emergencies.  This means that many mothers are still not getting the medical help they need.  In fact, many mothers are dying from bleeding during childbirth.\n\nThe number of children under five years old who get medical help for diarrhea has decreased.  But we do not have enough information about how well babies are being taken care of after birth.  This is a problem.\n\nFewer women are having C-sections than they should be.  In fact, only 4% of women are having C-sections.  The number of C-sections in urban areas is 7%, but in rural areas it is only 2%.  This shows that health services are not available equally in all parts of the country.\n\nAnother problem is that the rich can get better health services than the poor.  There is a 27% difference in the number of people using health services between the richest and poorest groups.  This is because the poor cannot afford to pay out of pocket for healthcare.\n\nNow, we need to think about how to improve the health of babies and mothers.  Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or improve the overall health system?  One tempting option is to focus on specific programs.  These programs are often easier to understand and can bring quick results.  However, there are some problems with this approach.  Investing in one area can take money and resources away from other areas.  This can cause problems in other areas of healthcare.  For example, when many resources are sent to fight HIV/AIDS, it can be hard for other areas, like family planning, to get the help they need.\n\nAnother problem with focusing on specific programs is that they can cause confusion and waste.  When many programs work on the same area, they can duplicate each other's efforts.  This can cause problems with supplies and funding.",
            "In Victorian novels, writers often write a lot of details and focus on the lives of the rich. Two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different from this tradition. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters stronger. This helps readers understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses strange events, like dreams, to show what's happening inside Oliver's mind. These events help readers understand what hurts Oliver and what he really knows about the world. In one part of the book, Oliver sees a shooting over and over again. He remembers it like a dream, even though it really happened. This shows that Oliver has no control over what happens to him. He cannot even protect himself when his life is in danger. This makes Oliver seem defeated. It seems that the bad people in the story are breaking him down, making him accept his unhappy life.\n\nIn another part of the book, a day seems to pass very quickly. The night comes and goes quickly, but it feels very long and quiet. It also passes quickly. This can be very sad.\n\nThese two novels use strange events to make their characters stronger. They help readers understand what the characters are thinking and feeling.",
            "I worked with students in an after-school program about two years ago. I helped them with their studies. I was good at English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He had trouble reading. I thought something was wrong. He knew some letters, but not others. He spoke perfect English. His mother spoke no English. She spoke Spanish. I could not speak Spanish very well. But I tried to talk to her. I realized that Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. \n\nI tell this story to show a problem in schools. This problem is the language barrier. It is a big problem in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading can be hard. I think we all agree that this is a problem. But what do we do? I helped Adrian with English reading. But for other children, the problem is more complex. We need a solution that combines many things. \n\nOne good idea is the dual language system. This system is good for all children. Children in dual language programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No. This is not realistic. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages.",
            "We are told from a young age that there is something greater than ourselves. Some people go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others visit the Temple or search inside themselves for answers. Most of us accept the religions our parents teach us. But some of us reject them. We choose our own path and try to understand ourselves in our own way.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so one rainy day when we sat on our porch. The rain was loud on the roof and the gutters were overflowing. He looked out into the rain, lost in thought. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and scared. I didn't want to talk about his illness because it made everything real. I hugged him and sat close to him, watching the rain.\n\nMy father died in December when I was 22 years old. He had been sick for a long time. The medicine had made him suffer, but it kept him alive a little longer. I did not want to see him die. I didn't want to watch the life that made me end. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is an interesting combination of old and new ideas. It is called an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" by Ian Watt. People have both criticized and praised the Gothic mode. Some say it has no depth, while others say it has a powerful \"terrible sublime\" effect.\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. His book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" used ideas from old romances and modern novels. Walpole combined old theatrical elements and natural scenes to create a new way of writing. He called this new style a \"Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic genre uses ideas from medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. When Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things. People thought it was old-fashioned and unsophisticated compared to modern society and literature.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas in the Gothic Novel made it popular for a long time. It was both old and new to readers who were far from the time when it was written.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a medieval idea about training a good knight. In the original Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" chivalry is both kept and changed. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it represents a noble knight who is brave, honorable, and competent. Writers like Walpole saw a lack of these qualities in their society. They used chivalric ideas to make the past seem better and to try to improve the present.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he was worried about the future. He was in a difficult time and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. This idea is seen in his character, Frederic. Frederic is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be a gallant and courteous knight. His character is an example of the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "The supply chain is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the final product. This process includes planning, producing, and distributing products. The idea of supply chain management was created in 1982 by Keith Oliver. It is a way to plan and control the process to meet customers' needs.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to provide good service to customers.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production. Production is the base of the supply chain. It includes when, where, and how products will be made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to see what customers need.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many to make. Then, they choose where to make the products and which factory will work best. They consider customer demand and satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to plan workloads and take care of equipment. Production is very important. Every detail is important. If details are not planned, it can cost the company time and money.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe second key part of the supply chain is supply. Supply means making decisions about a company's abilities and partnerships. A company may have many parts that make a product. The manager decides which part is best for each step. They may also decide to work with other companies to make the product. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn a company, there are many steps to make a product. These steps are production, supply, and distribution. Managers use these steps to meet customers' needs. They plan and control the process to make it quick and efficient.\n\n[REWRITE]\nFor example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have plans for every step of the business. This helps employees know what to do and when to do it. Having plans makes the company work smoothly.\n\n[REWRITE]\nSupply chain management is important for companies. It helps them meet customers' needs and reduce costs. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target use supply chain management to succeed.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page holds a sign in a street. It says \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. The government, called a junta, is very powerful. It has been in charge since 1962. In 2007, many people protested against the government. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. The protesters were mostly monks. They wore yellow robes. The government started to allow the monks to gather peacefully. But the situation became very bad. There was a lot of violence. The military went into the monasteries and caused trouble. Journalists from other countries were arrested and put in prison. Some were hurt. A Japanese journalist named Kenji Nagai was killed for watching a protest.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to control their people for a very long time. The ancient Romans thought their leaders were chosen by the gods. The Japanese emperor was believed to be a god. The emperor of Japan brought new ideas like small phones and a special way of dying. The president of the United States, George W. Bush, talked to a man named Ted Haggard.\n\nWe know of many bad things that have happened in history. One was the protest in Tiananmen Square in China in 1989. Many students, workers, and thinkers gathered to protest against their government. The government said few people died, but other groups said many more were killed. Another bad thing was the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. One group of people, the Hutus, killed many others, including those who were not Hutus. The government helped them. The Nazis, led by a man named Hitler, also did bad things. They killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He lived a long time and made many creative works. His music helped shape his orchestra. Ellington played the piano in many of his compositions, but he also wrote music that made other musicians shine. He created a framework for soloists to play freely. Ellington also wrote music with tight orchestration and unique phrases that showed the style of each musician. This helped create a special sound for each piece.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington used the human voice as a musical instrument throughout his career. He did this in his early work, \"Creole Love Call.\" This song is a slow, 12-bar blues. It has six parts. Each part has a different sound.\n\nPart 1: The voice and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then becomes rough.\nPart 2: A muted trumpet plays a solo that changes the main melody.\nPart 3: A clarinet plays a big, high note with a special piano sound.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part, but the brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other.\nPart 5: The woodwind instruments play the call and response in a high place. The brass and rhythm instruments play in a special way.\nPart 6: The voice goes back to the first sound, but this time it sounds like a special instrument called the \"growl.\"\n\nEllington used the voice to add color to his music. This is an example of his style.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington combined his skill at writing music with his ear for sound. He used two musicians, Bubber Miley and Baby Cox, to create a rich sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" shows how Ellington used a musician named Tricky Sam Nanton to make the music special.",

Now she wanted a person, not a thing. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys had liked her, tried to get her attention, but none of them interested her. She often thought about this strange feeling. She tried to think of what could cause it. She thought about this for a long time, but she could not find an answer.\n\nHer life at home was usually calm. Her parents were good people and calm. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her. The only times they argued was when she wanted to be more independent. She was a calm person, but she had a big personality.

            "A new study shows that eating a special kind of diet, called the Mediterranean Diet, can help lower the risk of heart disease and strokes. This diet includes more plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables, and more fish. It also includes less animal products and saturated fats. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who ate this diet were less likely to die from heart disease. But these studies did not study strokes. In this new study, researchers looked at 74,886 women who were part of a big study of women in the US. The women ate the Mediterranean Diet for about 20 years. The researchers used a special score to measure how well the women followed the diet.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of these healthy foods were less likely to get heart disease and strokes. They were also less likely to die from heart disease and strokes. The researchers used a special method to make sure that other factors, like age and weight, did not affect the results.\n\nThe study shows that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be a good way to stay healthy and lower the risk of heart disease and strokes. This diet is a good choice for people who want to eat a healthy diet.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes fell. This made many big companies weak. We must ask: why did this happen, and how can we stop it? The problem started because some politicians made bad decisions. They pushed banks to lend money to people who could not pay it back. This happened because the financial system was not strong enough to handle it.\n\nTwo important government organizations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were also involved. They helped banks sell these bad loans to other people. When people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They gave the problems to the people who bought the bad loans.\n\nThe problem started in 1999. The president at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to win his second term. He loosened the rules for lending money. This helped create the problem seven years later. A reporter named Steven Holmes said in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give more loans to people who could not afford them.\" He also said that this could lead to a big problem.\n\nMany new kinds of loans were created. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They tied many parts of the economy together. This made it easy for people to borrow too much money. When the housing market fell, the economy fell too.\n\nThe top five big banks in the US had $4.1 trillion of bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some banks, like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, failed. Others, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had to change the way they worked. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion of bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition: A Writer's Enemy\n\nExposition can be a problem for writers. It is when the writer tells the reader too much information. This can make the story boring. Dr. Merlin says she often sees this in her students' work.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known. But writers still make the mistake of telling too much. Dr. Merlin calls this the \"devil on the shoulder.\" It is the voice that says to get the background information out of the way.\n\nExposition is telling the reader what happened. It is like a character telling another person everything about their life. In a movie, it is like a long speech. In a story, the author does the telling.\n\nA good example is a story about a woman and her husband. The reader is told that they met, got married, and he was killed. But the story does not have time to show this. The reader does not get to see the husband's personality or how much the woman loved him. This makes the story less interesting.\n\nA writer needs to give the reader more information about the characters. This is called \"meat on the bone.\" It makes the story more interesting and helps the reader connect with the characters.\n\nIt is easy to get into the habit of rushing through the background information. But it is better to take the time to show the reader the characters and their relationships. This makes the story more exciting and enjoyable.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). It was a live broadcast. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. He looked very bad in his picture. They only showed his picture for about two minutes. They said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He is 18 years old and was badly hurt. The police have not made any arrests yet. They are investigating.\n\nI think they did not spend much time on the second story. I believe this might be because the man who was hurt is black. For a long time, I have noticed that when a minority person is hurt or missing, the news does not talk about it very much. But if a white person is hurt or missing, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. It was shot by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information that can help them catch the person who did it.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. There will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature will be in the mid to low eighties all weekend.\n\nThey also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. The man who robbed the store was black and was wearing a hoodie. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I think they talked about the man's color too much.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison for selling a lot of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I do not think it was important to say he is Hispanic.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. It is strong and hard to break. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in each other. When things are very bad, the true nature of this connection becomes clear. It can be good or bad. This connection comes with a great price. Understanding the feelings it brings means dealing with the results of those feelings. When a person can look at their brother and see themselves, they see who they really are. In their actions and the results of those actions is where their true character is found.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this idea. Two brothers go on a journey. It is a wild and vivid journey. Bitter disappointment and great pride come together in a big way. Only one brother survives. The story is told through the main character, Doodle, and his brother. The narrator helps us understand how they feel and see the world.\n\nThe main character's feelings are about his pride. He wanted a brother who could do what he did. He wanted someone to play with, to run with, and to climb with. But his brother, Doodle, was very sick. He might not live very long or do the things the main character wanted. This made the main character very unhappy. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt something good. This shows that the main character loved his brother too.",
            "The human brain is a complicated, creative system. It processes information in many ways. \n\nAt first, people thought the brain worked like a wax tablet. Later, they thought it worked like a book. Now, many people think it works like a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses change physical things like touch and light into electrical signals. These signals are changed and changed again by the brain in bottom-up and top-down processes. \n\nImagine you see a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing makes a simple picture of the box. It says the box is black and has edges. Top-down processing helps you understand it's a box. It's not just a hole in the white background.\n\nThe brain decides which signals are important. It chooses which processes to use. For example, when you look at your shoes, you don't notice every blade of grass. But you notice your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain has different kinds of memory. It has sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory. First, the brain puts information into memory. There are many ways to do this. For example, words can be stored based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean.\n\nThe brain keeps information in memory. Some studies show that working memory is like a temporary loop of electrical signals. Long-term memory is like the structure of proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things. Others come from computer science. Others come from the way the brain works at a physical level. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, the idea of a \"chair\" is connected to the idea of a \"table\" and \"wooden\".",
            "Aldous Huxley criticized the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He created a society where people value community above the individual and are conditioned to seek happiness above all else. The citizens are controlled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. A close look at the book shows Huxley's concerns about the growing power of technology and capitalism.\n\nHuxley used ideas from Marxism to criticize capitalism. He used words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification\" to show that the people in the book are forced to follow one idea. This idea is called false consciousness. It means that the common people do not understand their place in society and are more interested in their own success. The people in the book are controlled by the World Controller and are not allowed to think for themselves. They are forced to want things they do not need, like consumer goods.\n\nThe people in the book are divided into different classes, like Delta, Gamma, and Alpha. These classes have no power to decide for themselves. They are controlled by the World Controller and are forced to do what they are told. This is an example of hegemony, where one group has power over all the others. The people in the lower classes do not know they are being controlled, and the people in the upper classes do not care.\n\nIn the book, people do not form close relationships with each other. The characters are not developed and are only interested in their physical appearance. This shows that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom to think and feel. People are only interested in what others think of them and are not allowed to express their true emotions.\n\nThe people in the book are happy to follow the rules and stay in their place in society. This shows how capitalism can control people's minds and make them obedient. Huxley was warning us about the dangers of technology and capitalism and how they can take away our freedom.",

They told me that not long ago, the East Halls were separated from the rest of the school by empty land. Now, that space has buildings, sports fields, and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to get from one place to another.\n\nThe best solution is to use a bike. But a bike is not enough. Students must ride it, and the campus must be good for bicyclists. A friend of mine started riding again. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. I live off campus, near the center of campus. I have class in Thomas building, which is 25 minutes away by foot. But with a bike, it takes only 5 minutes.\n\nPollock Road is the best way to get to Thomas building, but it is not easy. There are things to say for walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That is a lot of time. I need all my time for classes, appointments, and other things."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

A study on mice found that special receptors on these cells help control sleep and wakefulness. If these receptors are not working correctly, it can cause sleep problems. This study suggests that genetics play a role in sleep problems. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment and our surroundings affect sleep. If we inherit a problem with our genetics, it can affect how well we sleep.

Finally, the paper will finish with ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a disorder of the brain. The brain cannot properly use the information it gets from hearing. People with CAPD can hear normally. They are not deaf. The problem is the brain does not work right to understand what is heard. It is not easy for them to understand words or to tell the difference between what is being said and background noise.\n\nCAPD was first mentioned in the 1950s. At that time, researchers were studying children with communication problems. They found some children could not understand what was said to them. They could not tell where sounds were coming from. They could not understand speech patterns. They could not understand changes in voice. One sound could cover up another sound. They could not understand the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors and special teachers use tests. They watch how the person behaves and how they respond to sounds. They ask questions and give tests to see if the person can tell the difference between sounds. There is no single test that can say for sure if someone has CAPD. There is no known cause for the disorder.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom. The teacher can make sure the student sits near the front of the classroom. The teacher can make sure the student can see the teacher's face when they talk. The teacher can ask the student to repeat what they say. The teacher can help the student to listen to one sound at a time. The teacher can help the student to understand what is being said by giving them extra time to listen. The teacher can give the student help when they are working on reading and writing. The teacher can help the student to listen to instructions and to follow them.",

This is because it makes people question why you are lying. Why do you want to be the opposite sex? In the play, a character named Viola wants to protect herself from bad people. She changes sex to be safe. She pretends to be a man. This helps her, but it also makes her feel alone and separated from the women around her.\n\nViola is so good at being a man that another character falls in love with her. This is complicated because Viola also has feelings for another character, but she cannot show them because she is pretending to be a man. The play makes us think about the feelings of two other characters, Olivia and Orsino. They may have unknown feelings for each other that come out when they see Viola pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play is like a mirror that shows us how lying can make us discover things about ourselves that we never knew. It shows how people may have feelings they do not want to admit to. But it also makes us think about the problems that come with lying. Can we be honest with ourselves and others and still be happy?",
            "German rule in Africa was very bad. It was especially cruel to the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. Germany had colonies all over Africa and Asia. Each colony was different. Germany's educational system was also different in each colony. \n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. Germans had done a good job of educating them. In other colonies like Kamerun, German education was also good. \n\nBut German South West Africa was different. The government did not pay much attention to educating the local people. Instead, Christian missionaries did most of the teaching. The government did give some money to the missionaries, but not enough. Germany spent a lot of money on schools for European children in South West Africa. \n\nThe result was that most local people did not learn to read or write. Many stayed poor and uneducated. Other German colonies did better. In those areas, many Africans could read and write. \n\nThis paper will look at the reasons why South West Africa was different. We will examine attitudes of European settlers and government officials towards African people.\n\nThere is a lot of information about education in Germany's African colonies. Most of these studies were written by Germans in the early 1900s. Later studies in English compared education in different colonies and looked at specific problems. These studies showed that each colony was different.\n\nA well-known study compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. The author, Cohen, said that the large number of European settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the differences in their educational systems. \n\nSouth West Africa was a good place for Europeans to live. The climate was not very hot, and many Europeans moved there. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. East Africa had fewer Europeans, with only 5,336.",
            "Heavy Metal Music: A Dark and Diverse Movement\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHeavy metal music has grown much since its beginning about a hundred years ago. Today, it is difficult to make a full list of its many kinds. Many of its main kinds, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have created many smaller kinds within themselves. One of the most interesting kinds of heavy metal is its sub-genre, which is known for its many different emotions. Heavy metal music often expresses sad or unhappy feelings. It is also very different because people can make many kinds of music within it. They do this by using different instruments and ways of singing.\n\nHeavy metal music has many different kinds of music within it. Some people like to make music that is very loud and strong. Others like to make music that is more gentle and quiet. Many people like to make music that combines heavy metal with other kinds of music. This makes it hard to say exactly what heavy metal is today. To understand heavy metal music, we need to know what it started from and why it is a movement, not just a kind of music.\n\nHeavy metal music is a movement that is known for being dark. It is like a \"more\" music - it has more loud music, more strong sounds, and more acting out. Heavy metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments, and this shows in their music. Heavy metal music also comes from people who have used drugs. In the 1970s, there was a time when many people used psychedelic drugs, and this led to the creation of new and crazy kinds of music. Heavy metal music has many qualities that are true to the darker side of life. Some of its qualities come from the Romantic Era, a time when people made many sad and emotional works of art. Some famous lyrics of heavy metal music express its dark and emotional side. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a well-known heavy metal song. It shows the darker side of life, like the effects of using drugs. This song was made in response to a song by the Rolling Stones that was also very heavy and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was just as strong and emotional as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau: A Dream of Recognition\n\nHenri Rousseau was a famous French painter. He created many paintings that showed his dreams and hopes. One of his most famous paintings is \"The Dream.\" It shows a woman who is very happy in a beautiful place. But \"The Dream\" is not just about the woman. It is also about Rousseau's own dreams and struggles.\n\nRousseau wanted to be a good painter. He wanted other artists and people to like his work. But he had a problem. He did not know if he should be like other artists or be himself. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not want to copy others.\n\nTo understand \"The Dream,\" we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in a small town in France on May 21, 1844. His father was a successful businessman. Rousseau grew up and worked for the government until he was 40. He did not go to art school, but he started painting when he was older.\n\nRousseau's life was not easy. He lost his first wife and eight children. He was very sad. He started painting to feel better. Rousseau's paintings are different from the paintings of other famous artists. He painted simple things that he knew and loved.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. But it was hard for him. Many other artists were already famous. He did not get recognition until later, when another artist named Matisse was becoming famous too. Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and exciting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as a good artist.\n\nRousseau's painting \"The Dream\" shows his struggles. He wanted to be a good painter, but he was not sure how to do it. He wanted to be accepted, but he did not want to copy others. His painting is a dream, but it is also a reflection of his own hopes and fears.",
            "Many people think that ethics and beauty are connected. I agree with them. I believe that at a basic level, there is a reason for this connection. John Keats wrote, \"Beauty is truth. That is all you need to know.\" Much of what we know in life is from learning or experience. However, we seem to understand ethics and beauty in a way that is not taught. Both ethics and beauty are attempts to describe, not to tell people what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are about explaining why something is beautiful or right, not about making rules for what is good or beautiful.\n\nFor example, when we talk about a work of art, like the Mona Lisa, we talk about things like color, contrast, and background. But these do not explain why the painting is good. When people talk about their favorite work of art, they often say \"There's something about it\" before explaining it in more detail. I believe that both art and morality cannot be fully explained. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that cannot be said any other way.\" No matter how well we describe a work of art, there is something more that remains unexplained.\n\nMorality and art are connected because we experience them in the same way. They affect us at a deep level that cannot be fully explained. This is especially true for literature. Literature is special because it has a moral quality. It is connected to our values in life.",
            "Germany today is a strong country with its own unique culture. This culture can be seen in many places, from the Alps in the south to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea in the north. People in cities like Köln and Dresden show this culture. Germany is different from other countries because it was made from many different tribes and groups.\n\nThe land where German people came from is called Germania. The name Germany comes from a group of people called the Germanic tribes. One historian, Tacitus, wrote about these tribes two thousand years ago. He said they were from a place called Tungria and were known as Germans before they moved to a new area near the Rhine River. They fought battles with other groups, called the Gauls.\n\nAnother historian, Julius Caesar, wrote about the German people in his book about the Gallic Wars. He heard the word \"Germanus\" from the Gauls, who used it to describe their neighbors. They used this word to show the difference between the people they fought and the people they did not fight.\n\nThere are different ideas about where the name Germany came from. Some people think it came from a spear that the German people used in battle. Others think it came from an old Irish word that means \"to shout,\" because the German people were known to be loud.\n\nA long time ago, Tacitus wrote about the origins of the German people. He said they were the original people of the area and did not mix with other groups. He asked, \"Why would anyone leave a warm and comfortable place to live in a cold and difficult land like Germany?\" He thought it would be a hard choice, and it might be true that the Romans did not want to live in Germany.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire and traded with them. They gave the Romans goods from their land and worked for the Romans in their army. This was in the first century AD.",
            "I stared down at the picture before me. I was not thinking about it in a big way. I was just looking at it. My mind was working hard, but I was not thinking about what it all meant. I was just seeing the things in front of me.\n\nI learned to draw from a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. It teaches how to see and how to draw. One thing it says to do is to put a square around the picture you are looking at. This helps make it simpler.\n\nBut at that moment, I was too busy being surprised. I could not think about the picture like that. I was just looking at it and feeling amazed.\n\nI wanted to be a good artist. I wanted to make something like the pictures of famous artists. They used different colors and shapes to make their pictures. \n\nI picked up my pencil and started to draw. My hand moved and my mind was working hard. But then I remembered why I was there. I had to clean the bathroom. There was a big mess in the toilet. I grabbed a mop and tried to clean it up. But it was hard. The bad smell was strong.\n\nI stood up and took a deep breath. I made a big effort and tried to clean the toilet again. This time I used a special tool to help me. I was very careful and patient. Finally, I was able to clean the mess.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many things come together to make this a big problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers also have little experience behind the wheel. This causes more accidents and problems like vehicles turning over, driving too fast, and leaving the road.\n\nTeenagers also do worse when they drive with their friends. Most teenagers drive with friends, and it is well known that this is a bad idea. A study in California found that the age of the passenger and the number of car accidents are related.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make driving safer for teens by giving them temporary licenses with rules. But these rules are not enough. The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers and responsibilities of driving. A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young to get a driver's license. He has done research that shows young people want to take risks for the fun of it. This is why we should delay giving driver's licenses to teens until they are older. If we do not, many more teenagers will die in car accidents.\n\nWe can fix this problem with a law. Schools can teach people how to drive before they get a license. But nobody under 18 can drive a car. We can still give permits to teens before giving them a full license. They will need to practice driving with a grown-up for a certain number of hours. We can use the same number of hours that most states require. This is a simple and good way to keep teenagers safe.\n\nThis idea is not new. It would be a good law to make all states follow.",
            "I looked at old films made by Thomas Edison. These films were made from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen trick films. These films use editing to make things seem real but not true. I studied these films to understand their special tricks. I wanted to know how they work and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of these early trick films take place in a single room and do not move the camera. The film is like a stage play. The actors enter and leave from the side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. In one film called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, the actors come in from the right and move side to side.\n\nThe films usually show the actors from head to foot. Sometimes they show the actors from the waist up. But they never show just their face. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. In plays and vaudeville shows, the audience sees the entire performance. They do not see just one part of the action.\n\nMost of these early trick films are short. They last about a minute or less. They show simple tricks like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes one \"shot\" is really several shots joined together to make an illusion. In a trick film, what we see may not be real. Look closely at a film called The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. We see something that looks like Mary's head being cut off. But it is really several shots joined together.",
            "John Taylor was a well-known supporter of the Republican Party. He was a farmer and had a short time in politics. Taylor was known for speaking his mind on personal freedom and government. He thought farming was the best job, and this belief guided his ideas about the government. He wanted to keep and help farming. This idea affected his thoughts on independence, the Constitution, and the court system.\n\nTaylor believed America had a chance to create a perfect system of government. There was no established tradition in the country, so the people who created the government could make a good system. He believed in the idea of natural rights. He said these rights are connected and if one is taken away, the others are less valuable. He believed the government should not control these rights.\n\nTaylor said that in a natural state, people with power and bad intentions profit. But in a civilized society, this should not be true. He wanted a government that considers the good and bad in people. Taylor believed that a good government protects private property, helps farming, and does not support capitalism. He thought a government with good principles would work well, even with different leaders. He believed self-interest is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it causes harm to others.\n\nTaylor wanted a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He wanted the federal government to have only the powers listed in the Constitution. He thought a strong federal government would be expensive and likely to be unfair. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation could be wrong and might lead to corruption. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution because it clearly states that the United States is a group of independent states.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people who submitted information about their commutes in the third month of the project. This was not good news, and we could not understand why it happened. Winter was coming to a campus in New England, so fewer people were walking or biking to school. This might be part of the reason for the drop. December is a busy time for students and teachers to finish their work and get grades. Maybe they just forgot to submit the forms. The holiday season also started in December. Many students and teachers went home for a month and did not need to come to school. Classes started again in late January, but that did not make up for the low numbers in February. People might get excited about a new project at first and then lose interest. To keep people involved, we created Carpool Challenge Week. It was a special week in March to try and get people to start commuting again. This worked and more people submitted their forms that month.\n\nOne problem was that people like driving their cars. It is a part of our culture. To get people to change, we needed to give them something. We gave away gift cards to local stores and restaurants. This helped, but it would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have worked better. For example, we could have given away a new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project.\n\nWe did not change the prizes during the project. Maybe we should have made them bigger over time. The gift cards were good at first, but more prizes might have helped keep people involved. We thought about this after it happened.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security. It follows an index, a product, or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. \n\nAn ETF gives you the benefits of many stocks and the power to make trades like a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin and buy one share if you want. These benefits are attractive. But the cost of ETFs is lower than for the average investment fund. \n\nHowever, there are some downsides. You have to pay a fee for each trade like you do for a stock. There are also many types of ETFs to choose from. But it is a good idea to check if the benefits of an ETF are real. \n\nFor this project, we will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to know if owning one ETF is good or if it is better to own a group of 10 stocks. We will also check if there is a better way to combine these stocks to get a higher return.\n\nWe cannot include all the stocks in the ETF. So, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the fund. Here are the top 10 stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a chart. The chart shows the percentage of each stock and how much it affects the portfolio's risk and return. We want to see if the 10 stocks are a good choice.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks can give a higher return than the ETF. The return is 6.11% higher. The risk of the portfolio is also lower. The risk, or beta, is 0.12 lower than the ETF.\n\nIt seems that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks can give a higher return with less risk. But we need to check if these results are real. We will look at the standard deviation of each stock. This will help us see if the two portfolios are different.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is a famous work. In this poem, the word \"Thulé\" is used twice. Poe got this word from the ancient writer Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain.\n\nThere is another source for this word. Poe liked reading German writers. He was interested in a writer named Goethe. Goethe was known for his poem \"Faust.\" This poem was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king whose wife dies. He drinks a lot and cries because he misses his wife. He then decides to die and gives his things to his children. He throws a special cup into the ocean and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" is similar to the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" Both are sad and lonely. They both have a dark world around them. This is similar to the scene in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in his collected writings. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he wrote \"ultma Thule.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" he used it twice, at the beginning and end of the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. They describe a sad and lonely world.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer. Poe would have known about him because he liked another writer, Tennyson. Poe said he admired Tennyson. Poe would also have known about Goethe from many copies of his work that were made after it was first published.",
            "California Law and Punitive Damages\nUnder California law, can a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get extra punishment money from the store manager? The store manager was eating dinner when he was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes.\n\nA judge is unlikely to reject the customer's claim for extra money. To get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted with a bad intention and did not care about the harm that could happen. The customer must also show that the store manager's actions were very bad.\n\nThe customer can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill would be bad because many customers had slipped and fallen on the same thing before. Even though the store manager knew this, he still did not clean the spill.\n\nIt is not clear if the customer's actions were very bad. However, it is possible to say that they were bad because the store manager did not take care of the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee told the store manager about the applesauce spill. The manager said he did not have time to deal with the problem. Another employee also told the manager about the spill, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt.\n\nBefore the customer's accident, five other customers had slipped and fallen at the store in 2009. Now the customer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury. We are looking at whether to ask the court to throw out the part of the lawsuit that asks for extra money.\n\nIn California, a customer can get extra money if the store manager acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice means acting with a bad intention or doing something very bad on purpose. If the store manager did not act with a bad intention, but his actions were very bad and he did not care about the harm that could happen, the customer may still get extra money.\n\nA court has said that conduct is malicious when the person knows that their actions could cause harm and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC.  A big question in our class was: Is Islam a hostile religion? I think this question is even more important now than before.  Since 9/11, I have seen the media change from being against Islam to being very friendly.  In 2001, a presidential candidate with a Muslim background would not have been elected. \n\nI find the story of the Prophet interesting.  His biography says he was a kind and humble man.  But this does not fit what I thought I knew about him.  I thought he forced people to join Islam.  He would win battles and then make other people join his religion.  But the biography says he was a kind leader.  People came to him because they believed in him.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad made food for many people and there was still enough.  This way of writing makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to seem like a kind and special person.  But it makes me think they are trying to take away from Jesus. \n\nI also do not like that many stories in the biography are not from direct witnesses.  The stories are from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI have a problem with the biography because it makes Muhammad seem like a perfect and kind person.  But history says he was not that way.  I think Muslims should know the truth about Muhammad's past.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and what he believed in were left behind in the growth of Christian thought after his death. If we look at the history of Christianity, we see a trend of it moving away from its beginnings. It seems that today, more people are becoming aware and thinking in a more modern way.  Most of the population still believes in traditional ideas and will not accept new thoughts. But those who know about history will become more aware in the future. They will want to know about the ideas that were added to Christianity and compare them to what Jesus really said. This will take a long time, but it will happen. People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus. They will remove the ideas that were added later. It will be like turning back time. Finally, people will follow the ideas of Jesus as if it were his time. The church will still be strong, but people will think and believe the same way.\n\nThis is not the first time something like this happened. Many years ago, Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire. But the empire later became Christian. Our country used to be against African-Americans, but now we have African-American leaders. Something similar will happen with Christianity. It will go back to its beginning and people will think the same way. This will happen because people will start to see Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact words. If we go back in time, we see that there was only one main idea: Judaism. It was the main idea that started Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem, in 63 B.C.E., the Jews had many different ideas. They were divided into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots.",
            "The Jungle shows that people are often selfish and do not think about others. They only want to make their lives better and do not care about people who are less fortunate. We see this in the owners and managers of big factories. They want to grow their business and make more money, no matter what. They do not care if their actions hurt people or animals.\n\nThe factories are very dirty and make a lot of pollution. The smoke from the factories goes high into the air and hurts people and animals. The owners also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They make the workers work very long hours and pay them very little. The workers have no protection and are treated very badly.\n\nThe book says that the workers in these factories are like slaves. They have no money and no choices. They are forced to live in poor conditions and work in bad factories. The owners and managers are very powerful and do not care about the workers.\n\nThe Jungle shows us that people in charge often think only about themselves and their money. They do not think about the people who are less fortunate and need help.",
            "Many writers use different ways to make their readers feel a certain way about important subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby. He pairs words together to make readers feel a certain way about a subject. Some times he uses a word and a color, but they do not usually go together. He uses this to make readers remember a feeling when they see the color later.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with many colors. He gives meaning to colors like gold, green, white, and red. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning of white and gray. He makes white a nice color and gray an old color. He starts this in the beginning of the book. Many people are always wearing white. They include Daisy and Jordan. People also wear white when they are important. Nick wears white clothes to a party. Tom wears a white shirt to meet Myrtle.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe everyday things. He makes readers see these colors in many things. People are in white when they are young. Old people are in gray. He makes readers see these colors in many things like houses, cars, and even dogs. When people are important, they are in white. When people are old, they are in gray.\n\nAfter he makes the meaning clear, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show readers that some things are not important. He does this with a character named Daisy. He stops using white and gray for a while. Then he uses them again to make readers see Daisy as not special. She wears a white dress to a party. He also writes about her fur having a gray color. He makes her seem like just a person, not a special person.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique a lot in the book. He makes readers see colors and remember how they feel.

            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many kinds of crops grow here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. People in the area like to buy food from local farms. There is a big demand for organic food from these farms. Many people are on a waiting list to buy from these farms. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Some farms give tours and let people walk on the land to see the wildlife.\n\nOrganic farming can be good for the land and the animals. It does not use chemicals that can harm the soil and water. But organic farming is more expensive than farming with chemicals. It needs more work and money to remove weeds and pests and to make the soil healthy. A small organic farm is not as efficient as a big farm. It also costs more to plant cover crops and to control the growth of plants.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. This land is next to the Cleveland National Forest. The plan for the area considers over a hundred kinds of plants and animals. Some of these plants and animals are in danger of disappearing. Others are getting fewer in number and may soon be in danger.\n\nThis land was home to Native Americans many years ago. After that, it was used for grazing cattle and for cutting wood. The land was part of a small farm a long time ago.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a piece of land like this. I also looked at government programs to see what a small farmer could do to make farming cheaper and better for the wildlife. I used a local organic farm as an example of what someone farming this land might try to do.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. Culture is not one thing, and it is not the same everywhere. It is not uniform and it is not the same for everyone. We should not say things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too broad and too simple.\n\nWhen we talk about a culture, we should think about what it means and how it will affect the talks. We should try to understand the culture, not judge it or try to change it. We can do this by learning about its history and its values. We should respect the culture and its traditions, especially if we are in a weak position.\n\nWe should also remember that culture is not just about countries. Companies have their own culture. For example, a company might expect employees to work long hours or have a relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire.\n\nValues are also important. Values tell us why people do things. If saving face is important in a culture, a negotiator will not want to make their company or leader look bad. If a culture values a strong bargain, a negotiator will not want to agree too quickly. Knowing these things can help us be a better negotiator.\n\nIt is also important to learn about the person we are negotiating with. This can help us make the talks more effective.",
            "A long time ago, a wise person in the Bible wrote, \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is similar to the thoughts of two other important thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. They both try to prove the existence of God. To compare their ideas, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible.\n\nWe will look at the ideas of St. Anselm first. He says that we can find the truth about God inside our own minds. He thinks that if we think about God, we will understand that God must exist. This idea is based on faith. Faith is trusting in something that we can't prove with facts.\n\nNow, let's look at the ideas of Thomas Aquinas. He thinks that we can prove the existence of God using reason and facts. He doesn't believe in faith. Instead, he uses five different kinds of logic to show that God must exist. These kinds of logic are change, cause and effect, something being possible or not possible, levels of perfection, and harmony.\n\nFor example, if you have a puzzle and you know you are missing one piece, you can figure out what the missing piece must look like without seeing it. This is similar to how Aquinas uses logic to show that God must exist.\n\nWhile both Anselm and Aquinas make good points, neither of them gives us a complete idea of why God must exist. We can only understand their ideas fully by accepting their point of view. However, this can make it difficult to compare their ideas because they are based on different kinds of thinking.",
            "A long time ago – about two thousand five hundred years ago – a famous teacher named Buddha was born. He was a prince at the time. Later in life, he gave up his life of luxury and found a deeper meaning. This led to the creation of Buddhism, a major world religion. Over time, Buddhism has changed and looks different today from how it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in the country of Sri Lanka. It is a Theravada nation where a special ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony is held every year. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, which has some spiritual meaning. But Buddha did not teach about any holiday like this.\n\nThere are many differences between the way Buddhism was in the past and the way it is now. These differences come from inside the Buddhist community and from outside. The Buddhist community has had to change its teachings over time because of these forces.\n\nThere are some important words to know for this discussion. \"Internal\" means something that comes from inside the Buddhist community. \"External\" means something that comes from outside. \"Hostile\" means something that harms the Buddhist community. \"Benign\" means something that does not harm or help the Buddhist community.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basic ideas of Buddhism – the ideas that are important to the religion. Buddhists seek help and protection from three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a set of teachings. It includes a collection of texts called the Tripitaka. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has speeches, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and the universe. Important ideas include Anatta – there is no soul, Dukkha – life is suffering, and Anicca – everything is always changing. When you understand these ideas, you can end the cycle of death and rebirth, which is called Sansara. You will also end lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion. For this to happen, you must become enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for how to live your life. For non-monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have sex with someone you are not married to, and do not take drugs. For monks, there are many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted 57 years.  It started in 1836 and ended in 1893.  They had many problems during this time.  The worst time was the Mexican-American War.  The United States attacked and defeated Mexico.  This war happened from 1846 to 1848.  The United States then got Texas and the Southwest as new land.  They had other fights, but they stopped before World War I.  The two countries had many differences.  They disagreed on things like religion, culture, and way of life.  They also had different ideas about what was important.  This is common when two countries share a border.  They often fight over things like land and resources.\n\nThis is like many other countries that fight with their neighbors.  The United States and Mexico are not alone.  Other countries near the United States have had good relationships.  This is true for the United States and other countries in Latin America.  Many countries have had problems with each other because of their beliefs.  In the past, Americans were against the Catholic Church and monarchies.  This is like the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.  But the United States and Mexico's problems were about religion, not politics.  They got these feelings from their past colonial rulers, the English and Spanish.  This made it hard for them to be friends.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had 17 problems during this time.  Most of them were about land and the border.  There were fights over border raids and other frontier problems.  The United States and Mexico had to use their armies to stop these problems.  As time went on, Mexico became more dependent on the United States.  This helped the rivalry end.  The United States stopped trying to take land from Mexico and started to help the country economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with a sickness I knew nothing about. I was a nurse at the time. I chose nursing to feel safe and secure. Many people told me this job would always be available because people will always be sick.\n\nMy dream was to be a scientist or journalist. But I chose nursing. Now I am 46 years old and unable to work. I get money from the government, but it is not enough. I have no money of my own. Every day is a struggle.\n\nI am grateful to my family and friends for their help. Without them, I would not have made it. When disaster strikes, you do not feel strong. My point is that disasters can happen in life. We cannot prepare for everything.\n\nWe need to stop relying on big government. But instead of building shelters, we should learn to trust each other. We should help one another and ask for help when we need it.\n\nConservatives talk about rugged individualism, but our ancestors did not succeed alone. They had compassion, respect, and shared their resources. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagons did not make it alone.\n\nBe prepared. I have a kit with first aid supplies and food. I also have a plan for a disaster. But it is also important to know your neighbors. Get to know them and ask for help if you need it.",
            "Scientists want to know why living things change over time. Are there rules that help decide what kind of changes happen? Although a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said in 1917 that it is hard to use math to understand simple living things, scientists are now using math to study how certain animals grow and change. They are studying a group of animals called mollusks. Our study is looking at how math can help us understand how these animals change as they grow.\n\nWe used a special kind of X-ray picture to study the shells of these animals. We made numbers from these pictures that can be used to make models of the shells. We used a computer program to make these models. We used the models to make predictions about what the shells might look like. We are combining this with other studies to learn more about how these animals changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space. It turns in a circle around a center point. This center point is like a line that runs through the middle of the shell. The shell has many circles, called whorls, that grow as the animal gets bigger. The whorls are like layers that add to the shell. The last circle is the biggest circle and is called the body whorl. The other circles are called the spire. The spire is all the circles except the last one.\n\nWe can look at a shell in different ways. We can look at it from the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. The front is the usual way to look at a shell. When we look at a shell, we can count the circles. We start by looking at the shell from the top and finding the first line between two circles. We draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. We count the circles from this line. We can count them by a quarter of a circle.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can make a map of this path using numbers. We can use this map to change the way the shell grows. Once we have a map, we can change the numbers to see what happens to the shell.",
            "Indonesia's rate of baby and child death in the first year of life has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in many areas, like water and sanitation, but it is not making progress fast enough in child and mother health.  The country still has a long way to go to meet its target goals by 2015.\n\nThere are many reasons for this slow progress.  We will look at these reasons below.  They show that Indonesia needs to improve its health system, not just specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some improvement in the number of births where a trained health worker is present.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  However, this includes traditional workers like midwives who do not have the training to help in emergencies.  This means that many mothers are still not getting the medical help they need.  In fact, many mothers are dying from bleeding during childbirth.\n\nThe number of children under five years old who get medical help for diarrhea has decreased.  But we do not have enough information about how well babies are being taken care of after birth.  This is a problem.\n\nFewer women are having C-sections than they should be.  In fact, only 4% of women are having C-sections.  The number of C-sections in urban areas is 7%, but in rural areas it is only 2%.  This shows that health services are not available equally in all parts of the country.\n\nAnother problem is that the rich can get better health services than the poor.  There is a 27% difference in the number of people using health services between the richest and poorest groups.  This is because the poor cannot afford to pay out of pocket for healthcare.\n\nNow, we need to think about how to improve the health of babies and mothers.  Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or improve the overall health system?  One tempting option is to focus on specific programs.  These programs are often easier to understand and can bring quick results.  However, there are some problems with this approach.  Investing in one area can take money and resources away from other areas.  This can cause problems in other areas of healthcare.  For example, when many resources are sent to fight HIV/AIDS, it can be hard for other areas, like family planning, to get the help they need.\n\nAnother problem with focusing on specific programs is that they can cause confusion and waste.  When many programs work on the same area, they can duplicate each other's efforts.  This can cause problems with supplies and funding.",
            "In Victorian novels, writers often write a lot of details and focus on the lives of the rich. Two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different from this tradition. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters stronger. This helps readers understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses strange events, like dreams, to show what's happening inside Oliver's mind. These events help readers understand what hurts Oliver and what he really knows about the world. In one part of the book, Oliver sees a shooting over and over again. He remembers it like a dream, even though it really happened. This shows that Oliver has no control over what happens to him. He cannot even protect himself when his life is in danger. This makes Oliver seem defeated. It seems that the bad people in the story are breaking him down, making him accept his unhappy life.\n\nIn another part of the book, a day seems to pass very quickly. The night comes and goes quickly, but it feels very long and quiet. It also passes quickly. This can be very sad.\n\nThese two novels use strange events to make their characters stronger. They help readers understand what the characters are thinking and feeling.",
            "I worked with students in an after-school program about two years ago. I helped them with their studies. I was good at English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He had trouble reading. I thought something was wrong. He knew some letters, but not others. He spoke perfect English. His mother spoke no English. She spoke Spanish. I could not speak Spanish very well. But I tried to talk to her. I realized that Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. \n\nI tell this story to show a problem in schools. This problem is the language barrier. It is a big problem in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading can be hard. I think we all agree that this is a problem. But what do we do? I helped Adrian with English reading. But for other children, the problem is more complex. We need a solution that combines many things. \n\nOne good idea is the dual language system. This system is good for all children. Children in dual language programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No. This is not realistic. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages.",
            "We are told from a young age that there is something greater than ourselves. Some people go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others visit the Temple or search inside themselves for answers. Most of us accept the religions our parents teach us. But some of us reject them. We choose our own path and try to understand ourselves in our own way.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so one rainy day when we sat on our porch. The rain was loud on the roof and the gutters were overflowing. He looked out into the rain, lost in thought. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and scared. I didn't want to talk about his illness because it made everything real. I hugged him and sat close to him, watching the rain.\n\nMy father died in December when I was 22 years old. He had been sick for a long time. The medicine had made him suffer, but it kept him alive a little longer. I did not want to see him die. I didn't want to watch the life that made me end. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is an interesting combination of old and new ideas. It is called an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" by Ian Watt. People have both criticized and praised the Gothic mode. Some say it has no depth, while others say it has a powerful \"terrible sublime\" effect.\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. His book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" used ideas from old romances and modern novels. Walpole combined old theatrical elements and natural scenes to create a new way of writing. He called this new style a \"Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic genre uses ideas from medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. When Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things. People thought it was old-fashioned and unsophisticated compared to modern society and literature.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas in the Gothic Novel made it popular for a long time. It was both old and new to readers who were far from the time when it was written.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a medieval idea about training a good knight. In the original Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" chivalry is both kept and changed. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it represents a noble knight who is brave, honorable, and competent. Writers like Walpole saw a lack of these qualities in their society. They used chivalric ideas to make the past seem better and to try to improve the present.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he was worried about the future. He was in a difficult time and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. This idea is seen in his character, Frederic. Frederic is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be a gallant and courteous knight. His character is an example of the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "The supply chain is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the final product. This process includes planning, producing, and distributing products. The idea of supply chain management was created in 1982 by Keith Oliver. It is a way to plan and control the process to meet customers' needs.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to provide good service to customers.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production. Production is the base of the supply chain. It includes when, where, and how products will be made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to see what customers need.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many to make. Then, they choose where to make the products and which factory will work best. They consider customer demand and satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to plan workloads and take care of equipment. Production is very important. Every detail is important. If details are not planned, it can cost the company time and money.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe second key part of the supply chain is supply. Supply means making decisions about a company's abilities and partnerships. A company may have many parts that make a product. The manager decides which part is best for each step. They may also decide to work with other companies to make the product. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn a company, there are many steps to make a product. These steps are production, supply, and distribution. Managers use these steps to meet customers' needs. They plan and control the process to make it quick and efficient.\n\n[REWRITE]\nFor example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have plans for every step of the business. This helps employees know what to do and when to do it. Having plans makes the company work smoothly.\n\n[REWRITE]\nSupply chain management is important for companies. It helps them meet customers' needs and reduce costs. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target use supply chain management to succeed.",

The government, called a junta, is very powerful. It has been in charge since 1962. In 2007, many people protested against the government. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. The protesters were mostly monks. They wore yellow robes. The government started to allow the monks to gather peacefully. But the situation became very bad. There was a lot of violence. The military went into the monasteries and caused trouble. Journalists from other countries were arrested and put in prison. Some were hurt. A Japanese journalist named Kenji Nagai was killed for watching a protest.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to control their people for a very long time. The ancient Romans thought their leaders were chosen by the gods. The Japanese emperor was believed to be a god. The emperor of Japan brought new ideas like small phones and a special way of dying. The president of the United States, George W. Bush, talked to a man named Ted Haggard.\n\nWe know of many bad things that have happened in history. One was the protest in Tiananmen Square in China in 1989. Many students, workers, and thinkers gathered to protest against their government. The government said few people died, but other groups said many more were killed. Another bad thing was the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. One group of people, the Hutus, killed many others, including those who were not Hutus. The government helped them. The Nazis, led by a man named Hitler, also did bad things. They killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He lived a long time and made many creative works. His music helped shape his orchestra. Ellington played the piano in many of his compositions, but he also wrote music that made other musicians shine. He created a framework for soloists to play freely. Ellington also wrote music with tight orchestration and unique phrases that showed the style of each musician. This helped create a special sound for each piece.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington used the human voice as a musical instrument throughout his career. He did this in his early work, \"Creole Love Call.\" This song is a slow, 12-bar blues. It has six parts. Each part has a different sound.\n\nPart 1: The voice and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then becomes rough.\nPart 2: A muted trumpet plays a solo that changes the main melody.\nPart 3: A clarinet plays a big, high note with a special piano sound.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part, but the brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other.\nPart 5: The woodwind instruments play the call and response in a high place. The brass and rhythm instruments play in a special way.\nPart 6: The voice goes back to the first sound, but this time it sounds like a special instrument called the \"growl.\"\n\nEllington used the voice to add color to his music. This is an example of his style.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington combined his skill at writing music with his ear for sound. He used two musicians, Bubber Miley and Baby Cox, to create a rich sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" shows how Ellington used a musician named Tricky Sam Nanton to make the music special.",

She often thought about this strange feeling. She tried to think of what could cause it. She thought about this for a long time, but she could not find an answer.\n\nHer life at home was usually calm. Her parents were good people and calm. They never argued with each other.

            "A new study shows that eating a special kind of diet, called the Mediterranean Diet, can help lower the risk of heart disease and strokes. This diet includes more plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables, and more fish. It also includes less animal products and saturated fats. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who ate this diet were less likely to die from heart disease. But these studies did not study strokes. In this new study, researchers looked at 74,886 women who were part of a big study of women in the US. The women ate the Mediterranean Diet for about 20 years. The researchers used a special score to measure how well the women followed the diet.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of these healthy foods were less likely to get heart disease and strokes. They were also less likely to die from heart disease and strokes. The researchers used a special method to make sure that other factors, like age and weight, did not affect the results.\n\nThe study shows that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be a good way to stay healthy and lower the risk of heart disease and strokes.

            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes fell. This made many big companies weak. We must ask: why did this happen, and how can we stop it? The problem started because some politicians made bad decisions. They pushed banks to lend money to people who could not pay it back. This happened because the financial system was not strong enough to handle it.\n\nTwo important government organizations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were also involved. They helped banks sell these bad loans to other people. When people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They gave the problems to the people who bought the bad loans.\n\nThe problem started in 1999. The president at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to win his second term. He loosened the rules for lending money. This helped create the problem seven years later. A reporter named Steven Holmes said in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give more loans to people who could not afford them.\" He also said that this could lead to a big problem.\n\nMany new kinds of loans were created. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They tied many parts of the economy together. This made it easy for people to borrow too much money. When the housing market fell, the economy fell too.\n\nThe top five big banks in the US had $4.1 trillion of bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some banks, like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, failed. Others, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had to change the way they worked. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion of bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition: A Writer's Enemy\n\nExposition can be a problem for writers. It is when the writer tells the reader too much information. This can make the story boring. Dr. Merlin says she often sees this in her students' work.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known. But writers still make the mistake of telling too much. Dr. Merlin calls this the \"devil on the shoulder.\" It is the voice that says to get the background information out of the way.\n\nExposition is telling the reader what happened. It is like a character telling another person everything about their life. In a movie, it is like a long speech. In a story, the author does the telling.\n\nA good example is a story about a woman and her husband. The reader is told that they met, got married, and he was killed. But the story does not have time to show this. The reader does not get to see the husband's personality or how much the woman loved him. This makes the story less interesting.\n\nA writer needs to give the reader more information about the characters. This is called \"meat on the bone.\" It makes the story more interesting and helps the reader connect with the characters.\n\nIt is easy to get into the habit of rushing through the background information.

            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). It was a live broadcast. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. He looked very bad in his picture. They only showed his picture for about two minutes. They said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He is 18 years old and was badly hurt. The police have not made any arrests yet. They are investigating.\n\nI think they did not spend much time on the second story. I believe this might be because the man who was hurt is black. For a long time, I have noticed that when a minority person is hurt or missing, the news does not talk about it very much. But if a white person is hurt or missing, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. It was shot by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information that can help them catch the person who did it.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. There will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature will be in the mid to low eighties all weekend.\n\nThey also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. The man who robbed the store was black and was wearing a hoodie. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I think they talked about the man's color too much.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison for selling a lot of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I do not think it was important to say he is Hispanic.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. It is strong and hard to break. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in each other. When things are very bad, the true nature of this connection becomes clear. It can be good or bad. This connection comes with a great price. Understanding the feelings it brings means dealing with the results of those feelings. When a person can look at their brother and see themselves, they see who they really are. In their actions and the results of those actions is where their true character is found.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this idea. Two brothers go on a journey. It is a wild and vivid journey. Bitter disappointment and great pride come together in a big way. Only one brother survives. The story is told through the main character, Doodle, and his brother. The narrator helps us understand how they feel and see the world.\n\nThe main character's feelings are about his pride. He wanted a brother who could do what he did. He wanted someone to play with, to run with, and to climb with. But his brother, Doodle, was very sick. He might not live very long or do the things the main character wanted. This made the main character very unhappy. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt something good. This shows that the main character loved his brother too.",
            "The human brain is a complicated, creative system. It processes information in many ways. \n\nAt first, people thought the brain worked like a wax tablet. Later, they thought it worked like a book. Now, many people think it works like a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses change physical things like touch and light into electrical signals. These signals are changed and changed again by the brain in bottom-up and top-down processes. \n\nImagine you see a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing makes a simple picture of the box. It says the box is black and has edges. Top-down processing helps you understand it's a box. It's not just a hole in the white background.\n\nThe brain decides which signals are important. It chooses which processes to use. For example, when you look at your shoes, you don't notice every blade of grass. But you notice your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain has different kinds of memory. It has sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory. First, the brain puts information into memory. There are many ways to do this. For example, words can be stored based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean.\n\nThe brain keeps information in memory. Some studies show that working memory is like a temporary loop of electrical signals. Long-term memory is like the structure of proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things. Others come from computer science. Others come from the way the brain works at a physical level. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, the idea of a \"chair\" is connected to the idea of a \"table\" and \"wooden\".",
            "Aldous Huxley criticized the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He created a society where people value community above the individual and are conditioned to seek happiness above all else. The citizens are controlled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. A close look at the book shows Huxley's concerns about the growing power of technology and capitalism.\n\nHuxley used ideas from Marxism to criticize capitalism. He used words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification\" to show that the people in the book are forced to follow one idea. This idea is called false consciousness. It means that the common people do not understand their place in society and are more interested in their own success. The people in the book are controlled by the World Controller and are not allowed to think for themselves. They are forced to want things they do not need, like consumer goods.\n\nThe people in the book are divided into different classes, like Delta, Gamma, and Alpha. These classes have no power to decide for themselves. They are controlled by the World Controller and are forced to do what they are told. This is an example of hegemony, where one group has power over all the others. The people in the lower classes do not know they are being controlled, and the people in the upper classes do not care.\n\nIn the book, people do not form close relationships with each other. The characters are not developed and are only interested in their physical appearance. This shows that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom to think and feel. People are only interested in what others think of them and are not allowed to express their true emotions.\n\nThe people in the book are happy to follow the rules and stay in their place in society. This shows how capitalism can control people's minds and make them obedient. Huxley was warning us about the dangers of technology and capitalism and how they can take away our freedom.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be a problem. My first year, I was in East Halls, which is far from the center of campus. I had to walk to class in Willard building, which took about 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, which made it even harder.\n\nI talked to an older student. They told me that not long ago, the East Halls were separated from the rest of the school by empty land. Now, that space has buildings, sports fields, and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to get from one place to another.\n\nThe best solution is to use a bike. But a bike is not enough. Students must ride it, and the campus must be good for bicyclists. A friend of mine started riding again. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. I live off campus, near the center of campus. I have class in Thomas building, which is 25 minutes away by foot. But with a bike, it takes only 5 minutes.\n\nPollock Road is the best way to get to Thomas building, but it is not easy. There are things to say for walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That is a lot of time. I need all my time for classes, appointments, and other things."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Finally, the paper will finish with ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a disorder of the brain. The brain cannot properly use the information it gets from hearing. People with CAPD can hear normally. They are not deaf. The problem is the brain does not work right to understand what is heard. It is not easy for them to understand words or to tell the difference between what is being said and background noise.\n\nCAPD was first mentioned in the 1950s. At that time, researchers were studying children with communication problems. They found some children could not understand what was said to them. They could not tell where sounds were coming from. They could not understand speech patterns. They could not understand changes in voice. One sound could cover up another sound. They could not understand the order of sounds.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, doctors and special teachers use tests. They watch how the person behaves and how they respond to sounds. They ask questions and give tests to see if the person can tell the difference between sounds. There is no single test that can say for sure if someone has CAPD. There is no known cause for the disorder.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom. The teacher can make sure the student sits near the front of the classroom. The teacher can make sure the student can see the teacher's face when they talk. The teacher can ask the student to repeat what they say. The teacher can help the student to listen to one sound at a time. The teacher can help the student to understand what is being said by giving them extra time to listen. The teacher can give the student help when they are working on reading and writing. The teacher can help the student to listen to instructions and to follow them.",

            "Heavy Metal Music: A Dark and Diverse Movement\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHeavy metal music has grown much since its beginning about a hundred years ago. Today, it is difficult to make a full list of its many kinds. Many of its main kinds, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have created many smaller kinds within themselves. One of the most interesting kinds of heavy metal is its sub-genre, which is known for its many different emotions. Heavy metal music often expresses sad or unhappy feelings. It is also very different because people can make many kinds of music within it. They do this by using different instruments and ways of singing.\n\nHeavy metal music has many different kinds of music within it. Some people like to make music that is very loud and strong. Others like to make music that is more gentle and quiet. Many people like to make music that combines heavy metal with other kinds of music. This makes it hard to say exactly what heavy metal is today. To understand heavy metal music, we need to know what it started from and why it is a movement, not just a kind of music.\n\nHeavy metal music is a movement that is known for being dark. It is like a \"more\" music - it has more loud music, more strong sounds, and more acting out. Heavy metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments, and this shows in their music. Heavy metal music also comes from people who have used drugs. In the 1970s, there was a time when many people used psychedelic drugs, and this led to the creation of new and crazy kinds of music. Heavy metal music has many qualities that are true to the darker side of life. Some of its qualities come from the Romantic Era, a time when people made many sad and emotional works of art. Some famous lyrics of heavy metal music express its dark and emotional side. For example, the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles is a well-known heavy metal song. It shows the darker side of life, like the effects of using drugs. This song was made in response to a song by the Rolling Stones that was also very heavy and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was just as strong and emotional as the Rolling Stones.",

He was born in a small town in France on May 21, 1844. His father was a successful businessman. Rousseau grew up and worked for the government until he was 40. He did not go to art school, but he started painting when he was older.\n\nRousseau's life was not easy. He lost his first wife and eight children. He was very sad. He started painting to feel better. Rousseau's paintings are different from the paintings of other famous artists. He painted simple things that he knew and loved.\n\nRousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world. But it was hard for him. Many other artists were already famous. He did not get recognition until later, when another artist named Matisse was becoming famous too. Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and exciting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as a good artist.\n\nRousseau's painting \"The Dream\" shows his struggles. He wanted to be a good painter, but he was not sure how to do it. He wanted to be accepted, but he did not want to copy others. His painting is a dream, but it is also a reflection of his own hopes and fears.",
            "Many people think that ethics and beauty are connected. I agree with them. I believe that at a basic level, there is a reason for this connection. John Keats wrote, \"Beauty is truth. That is all you need to know.\" Much of what we know in life is from learning or experience. However, we seem to understand ethics and beauty in a way that is not taught. Both ethics and beauty are attempts to describe, not to tell people what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are about explaining why something is beautiful or right, not about making rules for what is good or beautiful.\n\nFor example, when we talk about a work of art, like the Mona Lisa, we talk about things like color, contrast, and background. But these do not explain why the painting is good. When people talk about their favorite work of art, they often say \"There's something about it\" before explaining it in more detail. I believe that both art and morality cannot be fully explained. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that cannot be said any other way.\" No matter how well we describe a work of art, there is something more that remains unexplained.\n\nMorality and art are connected because we experience them in the same way. They affect us at a deep level that cannot be fully explained. This is especially true for literature. Literature is special because it has a moral quality. It is connected to our values in life.",
            "Germany today is a strong country with its own unique culture. This culture can be seen in many places, from the Alps in the south to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea in the north. People in cities like Köln and Dresden show this culture. Germany is different from other countries because it was made from many different tribes and groups.\n\nThe land where German people came from is called Germania. The name Germany comes from a group of people called the Germanic tribes. One historian, Tacitus, wrote about these tribes two thousand years ago. He said they were from a place called Tungria and were known as Germans before they moved to a new area near the Rhine River. They fought battles with other groups, called the Gauls.\n\nAnother historian, Julius Caesar, wrote about the German people in his book about the Gallic Wars. He heard the word \"Germanus\" from the Gauls, who used it to describe their neighbors. They used this word to show the difference between the people they fought and the people they did not fight.\n\nThere are different ideas about where the name Germany came from. Some people think it came from a spear that the German people used in battle. Others think it came from an old Irish word that means \"to shout,\" because the German people were known to be loud.\n\nA long time ago, Tacitus wrote about the origins of the German people. He said they were the original people of the area and did not mix with other groups. He asked, \"Why would anyone leave a warm and comfortable place to live in a cold and difficult land like Germany?\" He thought it would be a hard choice, and it might be true that the Romans did not want to live in Germany.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived near the Roman Empire and traded with them. They gave the Romans goods from their land and worked for the Romans in their army. This was in the first century AD.",
            "I stared down at the picture before me. I was not thinking about it in a big way. I was just looking at it. My mind was working hard, but I was not thinking about what it all meant. I was just seeing the things in front of me.\n\nI learned to draw from a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. It teaches how to see and how to draw. One thing it says to do is to put a square around the picture you are looking at. This helps make it simpler.\n\nBut at that moment, I was too busy being surprised. I could not think about the picture like that. I was just looking at it and feeling amazed.\n\nI wanted to be a good artist. I wanted to make something like the pictures of famous artists. They used different colors and shapes to make their pictures. \n\nI picked up my pencil and started to draw. My hand moved and my mind was working hard. But then I remembered why I was there. I had to clean the bathroom. There was a big mess in the toilet. I grabbed a mop and tried to clean it up. But it was hard. The bad smell was strong.\n\nI stood up and took a deep breath. I made a big effort and tried to clean the toilet again. This time I used a special tool to help me. I was very careful and patient. Finally, I was able to clean the mess.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many things come together to make this a big problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers also have little experience behind the wheel. This causes more accidents and problems like vehicles turning over, driving too fast, and leaving the road.\n\nTeenagers also do worse when they drive with their friends. Most teenagers drive with friends, and it is well known that this is a bad idea. A study in California found that the age of the passenger and the number of car accidents are related.\n\nCalifornia and other states have tried to make driving safer for teens by giving them temporary licenses with rules. But these rules are not enough. The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers and responsibilities of driving. A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young to get a driver's license. He has done research that shows young people want to take risks for the fun of it. This is why we should delay giving driver's licenses to teens until they are older. If we do not, many more teenagers will die in car accidents.\n\nWe can fix this problem with a law. Schools can teach people how to drive before they get a license. But nobody under 18 can drive a car. We can still give permits to teens before giving them a full license. They will need to practice driving with a grown-up for a certain number of hours. We can use the same number of hours that most states require. This is a simple and good way to keep teenagers safe.\n\nThis idea is not new. It would be a good law to make all states follow.",
            "I looked at old films made by Thomas Edison. These films were made from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen trick films. These films use editing to make things seem real but not true. I studied these films to understand their special tricks. I wanted to know how they work and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of these early trick films take place in a single room and do not move the camera. The film is like a stage play. The actors enter and leave from the side. They do not move towards or away from the camera. In one film called Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, the actors come in from the right and move side to side.\n\nThe films usually show the actors from head to foot. Sometimes they show the actors from the waist up. But they never show just their face. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. In plays and vaudeville shows, the audience sees the entire performance. They do not see just one part of the action.\n\nMost of these early trick films are short. They last about a minute or less. They show simple tricks like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes one \"shot\" is really several shots joined together to make an illusion. In a trick film, what we see may not be real. Look closely at a film called The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. We see something that looks like Mary's head being cut off. But it is really several shots joined together.",
            "John Taylor was a well-known supporter of the Republican Party. He was a farmer and had a short time in politics. Taylor was known for speaking his mind on personal freedom and government. He thought farming was the best job, and this belief guided his ideas about the government. He wanted to keep and help farming. This idea affected his thoughts on independence, the Constitution, and the court system.\n\nTaylor believed America had a chance to create a perfect system of government. There was no established tradition in the country, so the people who created the government could make a good system. He believed in the idea of natural rights. He said these rights are connected and if one is taken away, the others are less valuable. He believed the government should not control these rights.\n\nTaylor said that in a natural state, people with power and bad intentions profit. But in a civilized society, this should not be true. He wanted a government that considers the good and bad in people. Taylor believed that a good government protects private property, helps farming, and does not support capitalism. He thought a government with good principles would work well, even with different leaders. He believed self-interest is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it causes harm to others.\n\nTaylor wanted a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He wanted the federal government to have only the powers listed in the Constitution. He thought a strong federal government would be expensive and likely to be unfair. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation could be wrong and might lead to corruption. He thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution because it clearly states that the United States is a group of independent states.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people who submitted information about their commutes in the third month of the project. This was not good news, and we could not understand why it happened. Winter was coming to a campus in New England, so fewer people were walking or biking to school. This might be part of the reason for the drop. December is a busy time for students and teachers to finish their work and get grades. Maybe they just forgot to submit the forms. The holiday season also started in December. Many students and teachers went home for a month and did not need to come to school. Classes started again in late January, but that did not make up for the low numbers in February. People might get excited about a new project at first and then lose interest. To keep people involved, we created Carpool Challenge Week. It was a special week in March to try and get people to start commuting again. This worked and more people submitted their forms that month.\n\nOne problem was that people like driving their cars. It is a part of our culture. To get people to change, we needed to give them something. We gave away gift cards to local stores and restaurants. This helped, but it would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes would have worked better. For example, we could have given away a new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car. This might have helped people stay interested in the project.\n\nWe did not change the prizes during the project. Maybe we should have made them bigger over time. The gift cards were good at first, but more prizes might have helped keep people involved. We thought about this after it happened.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security. It follows an index, a product, or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. \n\nAn ETF gives you the benefits of many stocks and the power to make trades like a single stock. You can sell short, buy on margin and buy one share if you want. These benefits are attractive. But the cost of ETFs is lower than for the average investment fund. \n\nHowever, there are some downsides. You have to pay a fee for each trade like you do for a stock. There are also many types of ETFs to choose from. But it is a good idea to check if the benefits of an ETF are real. \n\nFor this project, we will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to know if owning one ETF is good or if it is better to own a group of 10 stocks. We will also check if there is a better way to combine these stocks to get a higher return.\n\nWe cannot include all the stocks in the ETF. So, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the fund. Here are the top 10 stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a chart. The chart shows the percentage of each stock and how much it affects the portfolio's risk and return. We want to see if the 10 stocks are a good choice.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks can give a higher return than the ETF. The return is 6.11% higher. The risk of the portfolio is also lower. The risk, or beta, is 0.12 lower than the ETF.\n\nIt seems that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks can give a higher return with less risk. But we need to check if these results are real. We will look at the standard deviation of each stock. This will help us see if the two portfolios are different.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is a famous work. In this poem, the word \"Thulé\" is used twice. Poe got this word from the ancient writer Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain.\n\nThere is another source for this word. Poe liked reading German writers. He was interested in a writer named Goethe. Goethe was known for his poem \"Faust.\" This poem was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832.\n\nIn \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king whose wife dies. He drinks a lot and cries because he misses his wife. He then decides to die and gives his things to his children. He throws a special cup into the ocean and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" is similar to the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" Both are sad and lonely. They both have a dark world around them. This is similar to the scene in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in his collected writings. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he wrote \"ultma Thule.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" he used it twice, at the beginning and end of the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like two poems that go together. They describe a sad and lonely world.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer. Poe would have known about him because he liked another writer, Tennyson. Poe said he admired Tennyson.

            "California Law and Punitive Damages\nUnder California law, can a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get extra punishment money from the store manager? The store manager was eating dinner when he was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes.\n\nA judge is unlikely to reject the customer's claim for extra money. To get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted with a bad intention and did not care about the harm that could happen. The customer must also show that the store manager's actions were very bad.\n\nThe customer can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill would be bad because many customers had slipped and fallen on the same thing before. Even though the store manager knew this, he still did not clean the spill.\n\nIt is not clear if the customer's actions were very bad. However, it is possible to say that they were bad because the store manager did not take care of the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, an employee told the store manager about the applesauce spill. The manager said he did not have time to deal with the problem. Another employee also told the manager about the spill, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt.\n\nBefore the customer's accident, five other customers had slipped and fallen at the store in 2009. Now the customer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury. We are looking at whether to ask the court to throw out the part of the lawsuit that asks for extra money.\n\nIn California, a customer can get extra money if the store manager acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice means acting with a bad intention or doing something very bad on purpose. If the store manager did not act with a bad intention, but his actions were very bad and he did not care about the harm that could happen, the customer may still get extra money.\n\nA court has said that conduct is malicious when the person knows that their actions could cause harm and they do nothing to stop it.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC.  A big question in our class was: Is Islam a hostile religion? I think this question is even more important now than before.  Since 9/11, I have seen the media change from being against Islam to being very friendly.  In 2001, a presidential candidate with a Muslim background would not have been elected. \n\nI find the story of the Prophet interesting.  His biography says he was a kind and humble man.  But this does not fit what I thought I knew about him.  I thought he forced people to join Islam.  He would win battles and then make other people join his religion.  But the biography says he was a kind leader.  People came to him because they believed in him.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad made food for many people and there was still enough.  This way of writing makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to seem like a kind and special person.  But it makes me think they are trying to take away from Jesus. \n\nI also do not like that many stories in the biography are not from direct witnesses.  The stories are from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI have a problem with the biography because it makes Muhammad seem like a perfect and kind person.  But history says he was not that way.  I think Muslims should know the truth about Muhammad's past.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and what he believed in were left behind in the growth of Christian thought after his death. If we look at the history of Christianity, we see a trend of it moving away from its beginnings. It seems that today, more people are becoming aware and thinking in a more modern way.  Most of the population still believes in traditional ideas and will not accept new thoughts. But those who know about history will become more aware in the future. They will want to know about the ideas that were added to Christianity and compare them to what Jesus really said. This will take a long time, but it will happen. People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus. They will remove the ideas that were added later. It will be like turning back time. Finally, people will follow the ideas of Jesus as if it were his time. The church will still be strong, but people will think and believe the same way.\n\nThis is not the first time something like this happened. Many years ago, Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire. But the empire later became Christian. Our country used to be against African-Americans, but now we have African-American leaders. Something similar will happen with Christianity. It will go back to its beginning and people will think the same way. This will happen because people will start to see Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact words. If we go back in time, we see that there was only one main idea: Judaism. It was the main idea that started Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem, in 63 B.C.E., the Jews had many different ideas. They were divided into groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots.",

They do not care if their actions hurt people or animals.\n\nThe factories are very dirty and make a lot of pollution. The smoke from the factories goes high into the air and hurts people and animals. The owners also do not care about the workers who make them rich. They make the workers work very long hours and pay them very little. The workers have no protection and are treated very badly.\n\nThe book says that the workers in these factories are like slaves. They have no money and no choices. They are forced to live in poor conditions and work in bad factories. The owners and managers are very powerful and do not care about the workers.\n\nThe Jungle shows us that people in charge often think only about themselves and their money.

            "Many writers use different ways to make their readers feel a certain way about important subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby. He pairs words together to make readers feel a certain way about a subject. Some times he uses a word and a color, but they do not usually go together. He uses this to make readers remember a feeling when they see the color later.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with many colors. He gives meaning to colors like gold, green, white, and red. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning of white and gray. He makes white a nice color and gray an old color. He starts this in the beginning of the book. Many people are always wearing white. They include Daisy and Jordan. People also wear white when they are important. Nick wears white clothes to a party. Tom wears a white shirt to meet Myrtle.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe everyday things. He makes readers see these colors in many things. People are in white when they are young. Old people are in gray. He makes readers see these colors in many things like houses, cars, and even dogs. When people are important, they are in white. When people are old, they are in gray.\n\nAfter he makes the meaning clear, Fitzgerald uses these colors to show readers that some things are not important. He does this with a character named Daisy. He stops using white and gray for a while. Then he uses them again to make readers see Daisy as not special. She wears a white dress to a party. He also writes about her fur having a gray color. He makes her seem like just a person, not a special person.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique a lot in the book. He makes readers see colors and remember how they feel.

            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many kinds of crops grow here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. People in the area like to buy food from local farms. There is a big demand for organic food from these farms. Many people are on a waiting list to buy from these farms. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Some farms give tours and let people walk on the land to see the wildlife.\n\nOrganic farming can be good for the land and the animals. It does not use chemicals that can harm the soil and water. But organic farming is more expensive than farming with chemicals. It needs more work and money to remove weeds and pests and to make the soil healthy. A small organic farm is not as efficient as a big farm. It also costs more to plant cover crops and to control the growth of plants.\n\nThe land we are talking about is near the town of Potrero in San Diego County. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. This land is next to the Cleveland National Forest. The plan for the area considers over a hundred kinds of plants and animals. Some of these plants and animals are in danger of disappearing. Others are getting fewer in number and may soon be in danger.\n\nThis land was home to Native Americans many years ago. After that, it was used for grazing cattle and for cutting wood. The land was part of a small farm a long time ago.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a piece of land like this. I also looked at government programs to see what a small farmer could do to make farming cheaper and better for the wildlife. I used a local organic farm as an example of what someone farming this land might try to do.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. Culture is not one thing, and it is not the same everywhere. It is not uniform and it is not the same for everyone. We should not say things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too broad and too simple.\n\nWhen we talk about a culture, we should think about what it means and how it will affect the talks. We should try to understand the culture, not judge it or try to change it. We can do this by learning about its history and its values. We should respect the culture and its traditions, especially if we are in a weak position.\n\nWe should also remember that culture is not just about countries. Companies have their own culture. For example, a company might expect employees to work long hours or have a relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they talk to each other, and who they hire.\n\nValues are also important. Values tell us why people do things. If saving face is important in a culture, a negotiator will not want to make their company or leader look bad. If a culture values a strong bargain, a negotiator will not want to agree too quickly. Knowing these things can help us be a better negotiator.\n\nIt is also important to learn about the person we are negotiating with. This can help us make the talks more effective.",
            "A long time ago, a wise person in the Bible wrote, \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is similar to the thoughts of two other important thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. They both try to prove the existence of God. To compare their ideas, we will assume they both believe in the God of the Bible.\n\nWe will look at the ideas of St. Anselm first. He says that we can find the truth about God inside our own minds. He thinks that if we think about God, we will understand that God must exist. This idea is based on faith. Faith is trusting in something that we can't prove with facts.\n\nNow, let's look at the ideas of Thomas Aquinas. He thinks that we can prove the existence of God using reason and facts. He doesn't believe in faith. Instead, he uses five different kinds of logic to show that God must exist. These kinds of logic are change, cause and effect, something being possible or not possible, levels of perfection, and harmony.\n\nFor example, if you have a puzzle and you know you are missing one piece, you can figure out what the missing piece must look like without seeing it. This is similar to how Aquinas uses logic to show that God must exist.\n\nWhile both Anselm and Aquinas make good points, neither of them gives us a complete idea of why God must exist. We can only understand their ideas fully by accepting their point of view. However, this can make it difficult to compare their ideas because they are based on different kinds of thinking.",
            "A long time ago – about two thousand five hundred years ago – a famous teacher named Buddha was born. He was a prince at the time. Later in life, he gave up his life of luxury and found a deeper meaning. This led to the creation of Buddhism, a major world religion. Over time, Buddhism has changed and looks different today from how it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in the country of Sri Lanka. It is a Theravada nation where a special ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony is held every year. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ceremony, which has some spiritual meaning. But Buddha did not teach about any holiday like this.\n\nThere are many differences between the way Buddhism was in the past and the way it is now. These differences come from inside the Buddhist community and from outside. The Buddhist community has had to change its teachings over time because of these forces.\n\nThere are some important words to know for this discussion. \"Internal\" means something that comes from inside the Buddhist community. \"External\" means something that comes from outside. \"Hostile\" means something that harms the Buddhist community. \"Benign\" means something that does not harm or help the Buddhist community.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basic ideas of Buddhism – the ideas that are important to the religion. Buddhists seek help and protection from three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a set of teachings. It includes a collection of texts called the Tripitaka. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has speeches, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and the universe. Important ideas include Anatta – there is no soul, Dukkha – life is suffering, and Anicca – everything is always changing. When you understand these ideas, you can end the cycle of death and rebirth, which is called Sansara. You will also end lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion. For this to happen, you must become enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for how to live your life. For non-monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have sex with someone you are not married to, and do not take drugs. For monks, there are many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted 57 years.  It started in 1836 and ended in 1893.  They had many problems during this time.  The worst time was the Mexican-American War.  The United States attacked and defeated Mexico.  This war happened from 1846 to 1848.  The United States then got Texas and the Southwest as new land.  They had other fights, but they stopped before World War I.  The two countries had many differences.  They disagreed on things like religion, culture, and way of life.  They also had different ideas about what was important.  This is common when two countries share a border.  They often fight over things like land and resources.\n\nThis is like many other countries that fight with their neighbors.  The United States and Mexico are not alone.  Other countries near the United States have had good relationships.  This is true for the United States and other countries in Latin America.  Many countries have had problems with each other because of their beliefs.  In the past, Americans were against the Catholic Church and monarchies.  This is like the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union.  But the United States and Mexico's problems were about religion, not politics.  They got these feelings from their past colonial rulers, the English and Spanish.  This made it hard for them to be friends.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had 17 problems during this time.  Most of them were about land and the border.  There were fights over border raids and other frontier problems.  The United States and Mexico had to use their armies to stop these problems.  As time went on, Mexico became more dependent on the United States.  This helped the rivalry end.  The United States stopped trying to take land from Mexico and started to help the country economically.",

We should help one another and ask for help when we need it.\n\nConservatives talk about rugged individualism, but our ancestors did not succeed alone. They had compassion, respect, and shared their resources. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagons did not make it alone.\n\nBe prepared. I have a kit with first aid supplies and food. I also have a plan for a disaster. But it is also important to know your neighbors. Get to know them and ask for help if you need it.",
            "Scientists want to know why living things change over time. Are there rules that help decide what kind of changes happen? Although a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said in 1917 that it is hard to use math to understand simple living things, scientists are now using math to study how certain animals grow and change. They are studying a group of animals called mollusks. Our study is looking at how math can help us understand how these animals change as they grow.\n\nWe used a special kind of X-ray picture to study the shells of these animals. We made numbers from these pictures that can be used to make models of the shells. We used a computer program to make these models. We used the models to make predictions about what the shells might look like. We are combining this with other studies to learn more about how these animals changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space. It turns in a circle around a center point. This center point is like a line that runs through the middle of the shell. The shell has many circles, called whorls, that grow as the animal gets bigger. The whorls are like layers that add to the shell. The last circle is the biggest circle and is called the body whorl. The other circles are called the spire. The spire is all the circles except the last one.\n\nWe can look at a shell in different ways. We can look at it from the top, the bottom, the front, or the back. The front is the usual way to look at a shell. When we look at a shell, we can count the circles. We start by looking at the shell from the top and finding the first line between two circles. We draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. We count the circles from this line. We can count them by a quarter of a circle.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can make a map of this path using numbers. We can use this map to change the way the shell grows. Once we have a map, we can change the numbers to see what happens to the shell.",
            "Indonesia's rate of baby and child death in the first year of life has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in many areas, like water and sanitation, but it is not making progress fast enough in child and mother health.  The country still has a long way to go to meet its target goals by 2015.\n\nThere are many reasons for this slow progress.  We will look at these reasons below.  They show that Indonesia needs to improve its health system, not just specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some improvement in the number of births where a trained health worker is present.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  However, this includes traditional workers like midwives who do not have the training to help in emergencies.  This means that many mothers are still not getting the medical help they need.  In fact, many mothers are dying from bleeding during childbirth.\n\nThe number of children under five years old who get medical help for diarrhea has decreased.  But we do not have enough information about how well babies are being taken care of after birth.  This is a problem.\n\nFewer women are having C-sections than they should be.  In fact, only 4% of women are having C-sections.  The number of C-sections in urban areas is 7%, but in rural areas it is only 2%.  This shows that health services are not available equally in all parts of the country.\n\nAnother problem is that the rich can get better health services than the poor.  There is a 27% difference in the number of people using health services between the richest and poorest groups.  This is because the poor cannot afford to pay out of pocket for healthcare.\n\nNow, we need to think about how to improve the health of babies and mothers.  Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or improve the overall health system?  One tempting option is to focus on specific programs.  These programs are often easier to understand and can bring quick results.  However, there are some problems with this approach.  Investing in one area can take money and resources away from other areas.  This can cause problems in other areas of healthcare.  For example, when many resources are sent to fight HIV/AIDS, it can be hard for other areas, like family planning, to get the help they need.\n\nAnother problem with focusing on specific programs is that they can cause confusion and waste.  When many programs work on the same area, they can duplicate each other's efforts.  This can cause problems with supplies and funding.",
            "In Victorian novels, writers often write a lot of details and focus on the lives of the rich. Two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different from this tradition. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters stronger. This helps readers understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses strange events, like dreams, to show what's happening inside Oliver's mind. These events help readers understand what hurts Oliver and what he really knows about the world. In one part of the book, Oliver sees a shooting over and over again. He remembers it like a dream, even though it really happened. This shows that Oliver has no control over what happens to him. He cannot even protect himself when his life is in danger. This makes Oliver seem defeated. It seems that the bad people in the story are breaking him down, making him accept his unhappy life.\n\nIn another part of the book, a day seems to pass very quickly. The night comes and goes quickly, but it feels very long and quiet. It also passes quickly. This can be very sad.\n\nThese two novels use strange events to make their characters stronger. They help readers understand what the characters are thinking and feeling.",
            "I worked with students in an after-school program about two years ago. I helped them with their studies. I was good at English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He had trouble reading. I thought something was wrong. He knew some letters, but not others. He spoke perfect English. His mother spoke no English. She spoke Spanish. I could not speak Spanish very well. But I tried to talk to her. I realized that Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. \n\nI tell this story to show a problem in schools. This problem is the language barrier. It is a big problem in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading can be hard. I think we all agree that this is a problem. But what do we do? I helped Adrian with English reading. But for other children, the problem is more complex. We need a solution that combines many things. \n\nOne good idea is the dual language system. This system is good for all children. Children in dual language programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit. How do we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No. This is not realistic. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages.",
            "We are told from a young age that there is something greater than ourselves. Some people go to Sunday school to learn about it. Others visit the Temple or search inside themselves for answers. Most of us accept the religions our parents teach us. But some of us reject them. We choose our own path and try to understand ourselves in our own way.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so one rainy day when we sat on our porch. The rain was loud on the roof and the gutters were overflowing. He looked out into the rain, lost in thought. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and scared. I didn't want to talk about his illness because it made everything real. I hugged him and sat close to him, watching the rain.\n\nMy father died in December when I was 22 years old. He had been sick for a long time. The medicine had made him suffer, but it kept him alive a little longer. I did not want to see him die. I didn't want to watch the life that made me end. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is an interesting combination of old and new ideas. It is called an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" by Ian Watt. People have both criticized and praised the Gothic mode. Some say it has no depth, while others say it has a powerful \"terrible sublime\" effect.\n\nThe first Gothic Novel was written by Horace Walpole. His book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" used ideas from old romances and modern novels. Walpole combined old theatrical elements and natural scenes to create a new way of writing. He called this new style a \"Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic genre uses ideas from medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. When Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many different things. People thought it was old-fashioned and unsophisticated compared to modern society and literature.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas in the Gothic Novel made it popular for a long time. It was both old and new to readers who were far from the time when it was written.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a medieval idea about training a good knight. In the original Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" chivalry is both kept and changed. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it represents a noble knight who is brave, honorable, and competent. Writers like Walpole saw a lack of these qualities in their society. They used chivalric ideas to make the past seem better and to try to improve the present.\n\nWhen Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he was worried about the future. He was in a difficult time and thought that people had lost the good qualities of the past. This idea is seen in his character, Frederic. Frederic is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be a gallant and courteous knight. His character is an example of the Gothic trope of excess.",
            "The supply chain is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the final product. This process includes planning, producing, and distributing products. The idea of supply chain management was created in 1982 by Keith Oliver. It is a way to plan and control the process to meet customers' needs.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to provide good service to customers.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production. Production is the base of the supply chain. It includes when, where, and how products will be made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to see what customers need.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many to make. Then, they choose where to make the products and which factory will work best. They consider customer demand and satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to plan workloads and take care of equipment. Production is very important. Every detail is important. If details are not planned, it can cost the company time and money.\n\n[REWRITE]\nThe second key part of the supply chain is supply. Supply means making decisions about a company's abilities and partnerships. A company may have many parts that make a product. The manager decides which part is best for each step. They may also decide to work with other companies to make the product. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.\n\n[REWRITE]\nIn a company, there are many steps to make a product. These steps are production, supply, and distribution. Managers use these steps to meet customers' needs. They plan and control the process to make it quick and efficient.\n\n[REWRITE]\nFor example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have plans for every step of the business. This helps employees know what to do and when to do it. Having plans makes the company work smoothly.\n\n[REWRITE]\nSupply chain management is important for companies. It helps them meet customers' needs and reduce costs. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target use supply chain management to succeed.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page holds a sign in a street. It says \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. The government, called a junta, is very powerful. It has been in charge since 1962. In 2007, many people protested against the government. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. The protesters were mostly monks. They wore yellow robes. The government started to allow the monks to gather peacefully. But the situation became very bad. There was a lot of violence. The military went into the monasteries and caused trouble. Journalists from other countries were arrested and put in prison. Some were hurt. A Japanese journalist named Kenji Nagai was killed for watching a protest.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have wanted to control their people for a very long time. The ancient Romans thought their leaders were chosen by the gods. The Japanese emperor was believed to be a god. The emperor of Japan brought new ideas like small phones and a special way of dying. The president of the United States, George W. Bush, talked to a man named Ted Haggard.\n\nWe know of many bad things that have happened in history. One was the protest in Tiananmen Square in China in 1989. Many students, workers, and thinkers gathered to protest against their government. The government said few people died, but other groups said many more were killed. Another bad thing was the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. One group of people, the Hutus, killed many others, including those who were not Hutus. The government helped them. The Nazis, led by a man named Hitler, also did bad things. They killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He lived a long time and made many creative works. His music helped shape his orchestra. Ellington played the piano in many of his compositions, but he also wrote music that made other musicians shine. He created a framework for soloists to play freely. Ellington also wrote music with tight orchestration and unique phrases that showed the style of each musician. This helped create a special sound for each piece.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington used the human voice as a musical instrument throughout his career. He did this in his early work, \"Creole Love Call.\" This song is a slow, 12-bar blues. It has six parts. Each part has a different sound.\n\nPart 1: The voice and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts smooth and then becomes rough.\nPart 2: A muted trumpet plays a solo that changes the main melody.\nPart 3: A clarinet plays a big, high note with a special piano sound.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part, but the brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other.\nPart 5: The woodwind instruments play the call and response in a high place. The brass and rhythm instruments play in a special way.\nPart 6: The voice goes back to the first sound, but this time it sounds like a special instrument called the \"growl.\"\n\nEllington used the voice to add color to his music. This is an example of his style.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington combined his skill at writing music with his ear for sound. He used two musicians, Bubber Miley and Baby Cox, to create a rich sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" shows how Ellington used a musician named Tricky Sam Nanton to make the music special.",
            "She had a feeling that something was missing. This feeling would not go away. It started when she was 14 years old, during her teenage years. Three years later, at 17, she still had it. Now she wanted a person, not a thing. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys had liked her, tried to get her attention, but none of them interested her. She often thought about this strange feeling. She tried to think of what could cause it. She thought about this for a long time, but she could not find an answer.\n\nHer life at home was usually calm. Her parents were good people and calm. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her. The only times they argued was when she wanted to be more independent. She was a calm person, but she had a big personality. People liked her.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She walked from room to room, looking for ideas. She heard a loud cry from the kitchen. Her mother was hurt. She ran to the kitchen, worried. She saw her mother on the floor, in pain. She said \"Ow\" many times.

            "A new study shows that eating a special kind of diet, called the Mediterranean Diet, can help lower the risk of heart disease and strokes. This diet includes more plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables, and more fish. It also includes less animal products and saturated fats. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who ate this diet were less likely to die from heart disease. But these studies did not study strokes. In this new study, researchers looked at 74,886 women who were part of a big study of women in the US. The women ate the Mediterranean Diet for about 20 years. The researchers used a special score to measure how well the women followed the diet.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of these healthy foods were less likely to get heart disease and strokes. They were also less likely to die from heart disease and strokes. The researchers used a special method to make sure that other factors, like age and weight, did not affect the results.\n\nThe study shows that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be a good way to stay healthy and lower the risk of heart disease and strokes. This diet is a good choice for people who want to eat a healthy diet.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes fell. This made many big companies weak. We must ask: why did this happen, and how can we stop it? The problem started because some politicians made bad decisions. They pushed banks to lend money to people who could not pay it back. This happened because the financial system was not strong enough to handle it.\n\nTwo important government organizations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were also involved. They helped banks sell these bad loans to other people. When people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They gave the problems to the people who bought the bad loans.\n\nThe problem started in 1999. The president at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to win his second term. He loosened the rules for lending money. This helped create the problem seven years later. A reporter named Steven Holmes said in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give more loans to people who could not afford them.\" He also said that this could lead to a big problem.\n\nMany new kinds of loans were created. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They tied many parts of the economy together. This made it easy for people to borrow too much money. When the housing market fell, the economy fell too.\n\nThe top five big banks in the US had $4.1 trillion of bad loans in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some banks, like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, failed. Others, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had to change the way they worked. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion of bad loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition: A Writer's Enemy\n\nExposition can be a problem for writers. It is when the writer tells the reader too much information. This can make the story boring. Dr. Merlin says she often sees this in her students' work.\n\nThe rule \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known. But writers still make the mistake of telling too much. Dr. Merlin calls this the \"devil on the shoulder.\" It is the voice that says to get the background information out of the way.\n\nExposition is telling the reader what happened. It is like a character telling another person everything about their life. In a movie, it is like a long speech. In a story, the author does the telling.\n\nA good example is a story about a woman and her husband. The reader is told that they met, got married, and he was killed. But the story does not have time to show this. The reader does not get to see the husband's personality or how much the woman loved him. This makes the story less interesting.\n\nA writer needs to give the reader more information about the characters. This is called \"meat on the bone.\" It makes the story more interesting and helps the reader connect with the characters.\n\nIt is easy to get into the habit of rushing through the background information. But it is better to take the time to show the reader the characters and their relationships. This makes the story more exciting and enjoyable.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). It was a live broadcast. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. He looked very bad in his picture. They only showed his picture for about two minutes. They said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He is 18 years old and was badly hurt. The police have not made any arrests yet. They are investigating.\n\nI think they did not spend much time on the second story. I believe this might be because the man who was hurt is black. For a long time, I have noticed that when a minority person is hurt or missing, the news does not talk about it very much. But if a white person is hurt or missing, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. It was shot by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information that can help them catch the person who did it.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. There will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature will be in the mid to low eighties all weekend.\n\nThey also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. The man who robbed the store was black and was wearing a hoodie. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I think they talked about the man's color too much.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison for selling a lot of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. I do not think it was important to say he is Hispanic.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. It is strong and hard to break. Inside this connection are many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in each other. When things are very bad, the true nature of this connection becomes clear. It can be good or bad. This connection comes with a great price. Understanding the feelings it brings means dealing with the results of those feelings. When a person can look at their brother and see themselves, they see who they really are. In their actions and the results of those actions is where their true character is found.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this idea. Two brothers go on a journey. It is a wild and vivid journey. Bitter disappointment and great pride come together in a big way. Only one brother survives. The story is told through the main character, Doodle, and his brother. The narrator helps us understand how they feel and see the world.\n\nThe main character's feelings are about his pride. He wanted a brother who could do what he did. He wanted someone to play with, to run with, and to climb with. But his brother, Doodle, was very sick. He might not live very long or do the things the main character wanted. This made the main character very unhappy. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiled at him, he felt something good. This shows that the main character loved his brother too.",
            "The human brain is a complicated, creative system. It processes information in many ways. \n\nAt first, people thought the brain worked like a wax tablet. Later, they thought it worked like a book. Now, many people think it works like a computer. But these comparisons are not perfect. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses change physical things like touch and light into electrical signals. These signals are changed and changed again by the brain in bottom-up and top-down processes. \n\nImagine you see a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing makes a simple picture of the box. It says the box is black and has edges. Top-down processing helps you understand it's a box. It's not just a hole in the white background.\n\nThe brain decides which signals are important. It chooses which processes to use. For example, when you look at your shoes, you don't notice every blade of grass. But you notice your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain has different kinds of memory. It has sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory. First, the brain puts information into memory. There are many ways to do this. For example, words can be stored based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean.\n\nThe brain keeps information in memory. Some studies show that working memory is like a temporary loop of electrical signals. Long-term memory is like the structure of proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain organizes knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things. Others come from computer science. Others come from the way the brain works at a physical level. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected ideas. For example, the idea of a \"chair\" is connected to the idea of a \"table\" and \"wooden\".",
            "Aldous Huxley criticized the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He created a society where people value community above the individual and are conditioned to seek happiness above all else. The citizens are controlled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. A close look at the book shows Huxley's concerns about the growing power of technology and capitalism.\n\nHuxley used ideas from Marxism to criticize capitalism. He used words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification\" to show that the people in the book are forced to follow one idea. This idea is called false consciousness. It means that the common people do not understand their place in society and are more interested in their own success. The people in the book are controlled by the World Controller and are not allowed to think for themselves. They are forced to want things they do not need, like consumer goods.\n\nThe people in the book are divided into different classes, like Delta, Gamma, and Alpha. These classes have no power to decide for themselves. They are controlled by the World Controller and are forced to do what they are told. This is an example of hegemony, where one group has power over all the others. The people in the lower classes do not know they are being controlled, and the people in the upper classes do not care.\n\nIn the book, people do not form close relationships with each other. The characters are not developed and are only interested in their physical appearance. This shows that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom to think and feel. People are only interested in what others think of them and are not allowed to express their true emotions.\n\nThe people in the book are happy to follow the rules and stay in their place in society. This shows how capitalism can control people's minds and make them obedient. Huxley was warning us about the dangers of technology and capitalism and how they can take away our freedom.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be a problem. My first year, I was in East Halls, which is far from the center of campus. I had to walk to class in Willard building, which took about 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, which made it even harder.\n\nI talked to an older student. They told me that not long ago, the East Halls were separated from the rest of the school by empty land. Now, that space has buildings, sports fields, and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to get from one place to another.\n\nThe best solution is to use a bike. But a bike is not enough. Students must ride it, and the campus must be good for bicyclists. A friend of mine started riding again. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and is the most efficient way to travel. I live off campus, near the center of campus. I have class in Thomas building, which is 25 minutes away by foot. But with a bike, it takes only 5 minutes.\n\nPollock Road is the best way to get to Thomas building, but it is not easy. There are things to say for walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That is a lot of time.
