            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The government did not help much with African education. Instead, it left this job to missionary groups. The government did, however, help the education of European people in the colony. They built schools and controlled the work of missionary schools. \n\nThis situation had a big effect on South West Africa long after the Germans left. While other colonies had many educated Africans, in South West Africa most people were uneducated and could not read. There were many reasons for this. This paper wants to look at these reasons. It also wants to talk about how settlers and colonial officials thought about African people.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these books are in German and were written a long time ago. They mostly told us about the educational systems in the different colonies. Later writers in English compared the education systems in the colonies and looked at special parts of education. They found that the educational systems were very different. One writer, Cohen, studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the large number of white settlers in South West Africa was one reason for its educational system. \n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land was desert. This meant that there were not many white settlers, but when there were, there were not very many. By 1913, only about 15,000 white people lived in South West Africa. This was not many compared to other colonies.",
            "Heavy Metal Music is a big group of music kinds. It has grown a lot over the past 100 years. Many new kinds of music have been added to the group. Most of these kinds of music, like rock and country, have their own smaller kinds inside them. One of the most interesting kinds of music in Heavy Metal is its ability to show a wide range of feelings. Most of these feelings are on the darker side. This means they are sad and serious.\n\nHeavy Metal started to get more flexible and diverse about 40 years ago. People started to create their own new kinds of Heavy Metal music. Then, even smaller kinds of music came from these new kinds. This process continues today. Many different groups make Heavy Metal music now. It is hard to say what Heavy Metal really is.\n\nTo understand Heavy Metal music, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement. Heavy Metal is a kind of music that is defined by its darkness. It is music with a lot of power and energy. People who make Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. They want to create a special kind of music that is different from other kinds.\n\nHeavy Metal music is also connected to the use of special kinds of drugs. In the 1970s, many people took these drugs and used them to create new kinds of music. This music was very different from other music at that time. Later, some groups took the dark and serious qualities of Heavy Metal from the Romantic music period. They used these qualities to make their own kind of music.\n\nSome songs from famous bands express the dark side of Heavy Metal music. These songs show how the music can be both good and bad at the same time. One example is a song called Helter Skelter by the Beatles. This song is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made in response to a song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau: The Dream\n\nA famous artist named Henri Rousseau painted a picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman looking at the amazing things she sees in a dream. But it is more than that. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted recognition and respect from other artists and people who love art. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know how.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in a town called Laval in northwest France. His father had a good job and was well-off. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for the government for many years. He was a customs inspector. But he loved to paint. After his wife and eight children died, he started to paint to make himself feel better. He wanted a new start in life.\n\nRousseau's problem was that he was working at the same time as many other good artists. They were famous before him. He did not get the recognition he wanted until he was older. A man named Matisse was also an artist. He and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and interesting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as an artist.\n\nThe Dream is a picture of Rousseau's struggle. He wanted to be like other artists, but he also wanted to be himself. This is a problem that many people face. Do you follow the crowd or be different?",
            "Many thinkers believe that ethics and beauty are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same thing. I agree with this idea. According to John Keats, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know comes from education or experience. But we seem to understand beauty and ethics without being taught. Both beauty and ethics try to explain things, not tell us what to do. We try to explain why art is beautiful or why an action is good, not give rules for making good art or behaving well.\n\nFor example, when we talk about the Mona Lisa, we might talk about the background and the contrast. But these things do not explain why it is a good painting. Often, when we talk about our favorite art, we say, \"There's just something about it.\" Then we try to explain more. I think that art and ethics are like this - we can't fully describe them. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We tell stories because a simple statement is not enough. We can't fully describe the qualities of a work of art or literature. There is something special that remains.\n\nI think that ethics and beauty are connected because we experience them in a special way. This is what philosophers call the \"noumenal\" level. We experience them, but can't fully explain them. This connection is strong when it comes to literature. Literature is a unique art form because of its moral quality. It is about values. We find values in literature and in life.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united and has a unique culture. This culture can be seen in the cities of München, near the Alps, and Kiel, near the Baltic Sea. The same culture is found in Köln, on the Rhine River, and in Dresden, on the Elbe River. Many people think Germany's culture comes from different tribes and sources.\n\nGermany's history began many years ago, in a land called Germania. The word \"German\" comes from an old language. One historian said it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were known as Germans before they moved to a new place and fought a war with other tribes.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans. He used the word \"German\" to say they were different from the people he had just conquered, called the Gauls. Caesar took the word from the Gauls. He said the Germans lived across the Rhine River and often fought battles.\n\nSome people think the word \"German\" comes from a spear called a \"ger\" or from an old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" It means the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said the Germans were the original people of the land and did not come from other places. He said they were not interested in leaving their land and going to other places like Italy.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They went to Germany to get goods and to fight battles. The Germanic tribes lived on the border of the Roman Empire and traded with the Romans.",
            "I looked down and saw a picture before me. My mind was not thinking about it. I was simply watching. My thoughts were moving in and out of my head very fast. It was like my brain was working smoothly without thinking much.\n\nI once learned from an artist's book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\". I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches many things about drawing, like how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines. One idea is to draw a square around a picture to make it simple. \n\nWhen I looked at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I could not imagine drawing a square around it. I was too surprised and amazed. I stood there and looked at it.\n\nPicasso liked blue, Monet liked green, and old Italian artists liked many colors. If I wanted to be an artist, I was starting to make my picture, my story, called \"Work in Brown\".\n\nI picked up a pencil and my hand moved to draw. My muscles were tight and then relaxed. My hand moved through the air and made a line on the paper. Water was flowing, smooth and calm. But then I was not thinking about art. I was trying to make the brown package on the toilet bowl move. It was stuck. I used a mop to try and move it, but it would not go away.\n\nI looked at the package with a frown. It was a dirty and strange thing. I used toilet paper to make a glove and then I put my hand in the bowl to try and get the package. It was a strange and unhappy moment.",
            "Teenagers die in car accidents. Several things cause this problem. One reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Many young drivers do not have enough experience. This causes more accidents and more people hurt or killed.\n\nDriving with friends is also a big problem. A study in California showed that the younger the passenger, the more accidents there are. California and other states try to make driving safer for teens. They give them special licenses that limit how many hours they can drive and do not allow other young people in the car.\n\nBut these licenses are not the answer. The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers of driving. A person named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young to drive. He did a study and found that young people like to take risks. They like to feel exciting. If we give them driver's licenses too early, more people will die in car accidents. In a few years, the number of deaths will be very high.\n\nBy the year 2010, many new teen drivers will be on the road. We need a law to keep young drivers safe. Schools can teach them how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car. Before they get a full license, they must have a certain number of hours of practice with a grown-up. This will help keep young drivers safe.\n\nWe should make a law to help keep young drivers safe all over the country. This is not a new idea. It is a good idea to help save lives.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I wanted to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of these films. They were made by Edison. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My film study looked at the way most of these films work. I also looked at the few trick films that break the usual rules.\n\nMost of the trick films are made in a stage setting. They do not move the camera. The camera stands still and looks straight ahead. This style of filming comes from theater and magic shows. The actors in these films do not move towards or away from the camera. They stay on the side and move back and forth.\n\nThe films are most often long shots or medium shots. Close-up shots are not used. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. They stay in the middle of the stage. The films are usually short, about a minute long. Most of them are tricks like magic and disappearing acts. They do not have a story. But sometimes, one shot can be many physical shots joined together to make an illusion.\n\nFor example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" we see Mary's head being cut off. But if we look closely, we see where the shot starts. The film is one shot in our eyes, but it is many physical shots.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a man who strongly supported Republicanism. He was a farmer, but his farming career and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best way to live, and this idea affected his thoughts about government, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government. The country had no old traditions to follow, so the people who created the government could make a new and fair system. He believed in natural rights, which are rights that all people should have. He thought these rights are connected, so if one right is taken away, all the others are not as valuable.\n\nTaylor said that in the natural world, people with strength and bad intentions often get what they want. But in a civilized society, this should not happen. To make a good society, Taylor thought the government should be made to deal with the good and bad parts of people. He believed in a simple system of good and bad. He said that good principles are those that protect people's property, make farming better, and do not allow too much capitalism. A government based on these principles would be fair, even if the people in charge are not.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is very limited and only has the powers the Constitution says it has. He did not want a big government because it would be expensive and might become mean. He thought a simple, straightforward reading of the Constitution could be bad if it does not consider the ideas behind the document. He also thought the Declaration of Independence was the most important document because it clearly says that the United States is a group of independent states, not one country.",
            "We look at the numbers from the project. In the third month, there was a big drop in people submitting their commuter logs. This was not what we wanted. We tried to understand why it happened. We thought the problem might be the cold weather. Fewer people walk or bike in the winter. The end of the school year in December is also a busy time. Some people do not even come to campus. They might forget to fill out the log. The holidays also started in December. People took a break from school. Classes started again in January. But even after that, the number of logs was low. We thought this might be because people get excited at first and then lose interest. We tried to stop this from happening. We made a special week, the Carpool Challenge Week, in March. We wanted to make the project interesting again. It worked. More people filled out the log. One problem with our project is that people like driving. It is part of our culture. To get people to use different ways to commute, we need to give them a reason. We gave out prizes like gift cards. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bicycle or a new car. This might have kept people interested. The prizes did not change during the project. If we had given out bigger prizes, it might have worked. The gift cards were good at first, but they did not help in the end.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that follows an index, a commodity or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. It gives you the benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning a single stock, like selling short or buying on margin. You can also buy as few as one share in any transaction. The costs of ETFs are much lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, you must pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, like you do on a stock order.\n\nETFs have many different kinds. This makes it easy to find one that fits your needs. But it is a good idea to examine the benefits you get from an ETF and how much you get. For this effort, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to know if the benefits of owning one ETF are as good as owning a group of 10 stocks. And if there are better ways to buy these stocks.\n\nWe will only look at the top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are these stocks and the percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will use their percentage of assets to calculate their effect on a portfolio's Beta and Return. We can do this by assuming a portfolio made up of these 10 stocks in the same proportion as the ETF. The results are in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a 16% higher return than the ETF. And its Beta would be 0.12 lower. This means that the portfolio could provide a higher return with less risk. But we need to know if these results are truly different.\n\nTo do this, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF. This will help us understand the risk of each portfolio.",
            "Poe's Poem \"Dream-Land\"\nPoe thought his poem \"Dream-Land\" was one of his best. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thulé\". Poe got \"Thulé\" from a famous writer named Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe a place north of Britain. People thought this place was the end of the world.\n\nBut Poe was also interested in German writers. One writer he liked was Goethe. Goethe wrote a poem called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. Poe was probably influenced by Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe's \"Faust\" includes a short poem about a king named Thule. This king's wife died, and he drank a lot and cried. He gave his things to his children and then went to a cliff and died. Poe's character in \"Dream-Land\" is similar to this king. He is sad and lonely.\n\nPoe used \"Thulé\" twice in his poem \"Dream-Land\". He also used it in his story \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe liked Goethe's work and was probably influenced by it. This is clear in his poem \"Dream-Land\".\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe respected. Poe liked another writer, Tennyson, and Tennyson liked Goethe. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of Tennyson. Poe also saw many copies of Goethe's work after it was first published.",
            "California law says a customer who was hurt after slipping and falling on applesauce in a grocery store may be able to get extra money from the store. This is because the store manager did not clean up the spill for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner at the time.\n\nA court is not likely to throw out the customer's claim for extra money. The customer must prove that the store manager acted with bad intentions. She must show that he was aware that not cleaning up the spill could hurt someone and still chose to do nothing. \n\nThe customer has evidence that the manager knew the spill was a danger. Several people had slipped and fallen in the store many times before she fell. The manager even knew about the previous accidents, but he still did not clean up the spill.\n\nThe customer will argue that the manager's actions were very bad. He was not just careless, but he showed a bad intention to ignore the danger. The customer will say that the manager's actions were bad because he knew about the danger and still did nothing to fix it.\n\nIn the past, six people had slipped and fallen in the store in one year. The manager still did not take care to keep the store safe. This will be a big part of the customer's argument.\n\nThe store manager was informed about the spill two times. The first time, he said he was on a break and did not have time to deal with it. The second time, he said the same thing. Thirty minutes later, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back.\n\nTo get extra money, the customer must prove that the store manager acted with bad intentions. The law in California says a person can get extra money from another person if they acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means acting with the intention to cause harm, or not intending to cause harm, but acting very badly and showing a disregard for other people's safety.\n\nA court has said that a person acts with malice when they know that their actions could cause harm, but they still choose to do nothing to stop it. In this case, the store manager knew that not cleaning up the spill could hurt someone, but he still did nothing. This will be a big part of the customer's argument.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC four years ago.  The main topic of our class discussions was whether Islam is a violent religion.  I think the question is more important now than ever.  After 9/11, I saw how the media changed its view of Islam.  Now, we see a lot of acceptance of Islam in America.  In 2001, I don't think we would have voted for a president like Barack Obama, who has a Muslim family background.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  It does not fit with what I thought I knew about him.  I thought he forced people to join Islam.  But the biography says he was a humble man who was misunderstood.  People came to believe in him because they saw the truth in his words.  \n\nThere are some similar things between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad took little food and made a lot for many people to eat.  The story of Muhammad makes me think that the writers wanted to show him as a humble man.  But this makes me think they are taking away from the life and miracles of Jesus.  It is like they are taking credit for Jesus' life.\n\nThe stories in the biography are often from other people's perspectives.  This makes me question the stories.  I don't like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI don't like how the biography tries to show Muhammad as a good man.  I know from history that he did not act like a kind and humble man.  I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's teachings and beliefs moved away from their origin after Jesus' death.  We see this happening in history.  Christianity is moving farther from its original beliefs.  Many people still follow traditional ideas.  But more people are becoming aware and want to know more about the origin of their religion.  They want to know the true meaning of Jesus' teachings.\n\nThis movement will continue to grow.  People will want to separate the teachings of Jesus from the ideas that were added later.  It may take many years, but this is what will happen.  The true meaning of Christianity will come back to life.  People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus.  This will be a big change.  The church will stay strong, but the way people believe and live will become more alike.\n\nLook at history.  Many things have changed over time.  Once, Christians were treated badly by the Roman Empire.  But later, the empire became Christian.  Our country has changed, too.  Slavery was once a part of our country.  Now, African-Americans are leaders in our country.  This change will happen in the Christian church.\n\nTo make this change, people will learn to see Jesus' words as metaphors, not as rules.  So, what happened after Jesus' death?\n\nThe Jewish people were the first to believe in one God.  They were a special group of people.  They had different groups, like the Sadducees and Pharisees.

            "I think The Jungle shows that people are often selfish and only think of themselves. They want to make their own lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. The factory owners and managers are a good example. They just want to make their companies bigger and more successful. They do not care about people or animals that might be hurt by their actions. The owner of the factory in the book wants to make money, no matter what. He does not care about the pollution from his factory or the bad conditions where the animals live.\n\nThe owners and managers also do not treat their workers well. They work the workers very hard and do not give them fair pay or good working conditions. They just want to make more money. If the workers get hurt or sick, the owners do not care. They can just let them go without giving them any help.\n\nThe workers in the book are very unhappy. They are treated like slaves. They have to work very hard and do not have any protection. They are poor and do not have much power. The owners and managers are very powerful and do not care about the workers. This makes the workers very angry and unhappy.\n\nThe Jungle shows that some people are very selfish and do not care about others. They just want to make money and get ahead. This is a bad way to live and can cause a lot of problems.",
            "Many authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some ways are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs an adjective and a noun that do not usually fit together to make readers think of a certain idea. Other times, he gives a special meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose.\n\nFitzgerald uses this last way with many colors, including gold, green, white, and red. In his novel The Great Gatsby, he makes special meanings for colors, such as white and red. He uses these meanings to make readers remember a certain feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald makes for white is uniformity. White is a bit better and more important. Gray is more old and not as good. He shows this meaning at the beginning of the novel. Everyone is always wearing white: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white flannels, Tom wears a white shirt, and Catherine is very white.\n\nFitzgerald also gives a special meaning to gray. He makes gray mean old and not as good. In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his first impression of Gatsby's party. Fitzgerald also uses these colors for common, unimportant things: Nick goes down white streets in lower New York, gray names are on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is a gray apartment-house.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald makes these meanings clear, he uses them to show that something is not important. He starts with Daisy. He does not use these colors for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing white. Readers begin to see Daisy as not a special person, but just something Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique around Daisy to show that she is not special.\n\nHe also uses this technique with Tom and Gatsby. Tom and Gatsby are wearing gray clothes, and readers start to see them as old and not important. Fitzgerald makes readers see that these people are not special.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show readers that some people are not important. He shows that some people are just trying to be something they are not. He uses these colors to show readers that some people are just like everyone else.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The climate is mild and sunny. Many kinds of crops grow well there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. People want to buy food from local farms. Many farmers in San Diego grow food without using chemicals. They call this organic farming.\n\nThese farmers sell their food to people who want to eat healthy food. Some farmers also give tours of their farms. People can walk or hike on the farms. They can see birds and other animals. This can be a good way for farmers to make money.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This makes it easier for plants and animals to live there. But organic farming is not always easy. It needs more work to keep pests and weeds out and to make the soil healthy. It also costs more money than farming with chemicals.\n\nThe land chosen for this example is in San Diego County. It is next to a small town. The land is 160 acres. It is covered with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. Many kinds of plants and animals live there. Some are endangered. They include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. They were Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and wood sellers. The land was used for grazing and making wood for many years.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a website and looked at government programs that can help farmers.

            "Culture is an important part of any negotiation. Culture can be defined in many ways. It is not one thing, and it can be different for different people. We should not make broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too general and not true for every person. \n\nWhen we learn about a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. This helps us understand it better. To learn about a foreign culture, we can study its history, its values, and its way of thinking. We must accept a culture for what it is and work within its rules, especially when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation.\n\nA culture is not just about a country. Companies also have their own culture. For example, some companies value long work hours while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they work together. Even within the same country, different companies can have different cultures.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They explain why people make decisions. If saving face is important in a culture, a negotiator will not publicly disagree with others. If making a good deal is important, a negotiator will not settle quickly. Knowing these things can help a negotiator be more successful.\n\nBefore a negotiation, it is helpful to learn about the other person's culture and values. This way, we can be more effective in our negotiations.",
            "A famous Bible verse says, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is also found in the writings of two famous thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. They both believe in the existence of God, but they use different methods to explain why. To compare their ideas, we will assume they are talking about the God of the Bible. \n\nTo understand their arguments, we need to look at each of their ideas. St. Anselm's argument is based on faith. He says that because we can imagine God, it is impossible for him not to exist. Anselm thinks we can find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. He believes the truth about God is already inside our minds, so we do not need external proof. This idea is often called faith in Christian teachings.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks the existence of God can be proven by using reason and evidence. He does not need faith to make his argument. Aquinas gives five reasons for believing in God. He says that change, cause, contingency, order, and harmony all need a higher power, God, to explain them. We can understand the existence of God by using logic.\n\nIn short, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas have different ways of understanding God. Anselm uses faith, while Aquinas uses reason and evidence.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. This prince would one day be called Buddha. Over his life, he gave up his position in the world and became very wise. He taught people, and his teachings led to the creation of a big group called Buddhism. This group is about twenty-five hundred years old. It looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. You can see this in the country of Sri Lanka. There, a special ceremony is held every year. Many people, including monks and regular people, take part in this ceremony. It has some religious importance, but it is not mentioned in Buddha's teachings.\n\nThe group of people who practice Theravada Buddhism has changed over time. This change is from the small things to the most important parts of the religion. The Theravada community has had to change its ideas over time. This happened because of forces both inside and outside the group. Sometimes these forces were good, and sometimes they were bad.\n\nThere are some important words we will use often in this discussion. When we talk about a force inside the Buddhist group, it means a force from someone who follows the Buddha's teachings. A force from someone who is not a Buddhist is outside the group. A bad force is something that hurts or wants to hurt the Buddhist group. A good force is something that does not want to hurt or help the group, but may do one of these things by accident.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basics of Buddhism. The most important ideas in Buddhism are the Triple Gem. The Triple Gem is the Buddha, the teachings, and the group of monks. The teachings are made up of three groups of text. One group has all the teachings of the Buddha. Another group has rules for living. The third group has ideas about the world and how it works. Some of these ideas are that there is no soul, life is suffering, and everything is changing.\n\nBy understanding these ideas, people can stop the never-ending cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. When people become wise, they will also stop desire, hatred, and delusion. The rules for living in Buddhism are found in the group of text that has rules. For people who are not monks, there are five rules. For monks, there are more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once rivals for 57 years. This was from 1836 to 1893. They had a major fight, the Mexican-American War, in 1846-1848. The United States won and got Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThese two countries had many disagreements. They disagreed about religion, culture and customs. They also had clashes over important things like money and resources. This is like many other countries that share a border.\n\nWhen countries share a border, they often have disagreements. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have long-lasting rivalries. They have a long history of problems.\n\nOne problem was about religion. Many years ago, Americans did not like Catholicism. This was a major issue between the two countries. It was like the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. But this was about religion, not politics.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many problems. They had 17 major disagreements from 1836 to 1893. Most of these were about land and border problems. There were many raids from Mexico into the United States. And there were problems on the border.\n\nAs time went on, the rivalry between the two countries decreased. Mexico became dependent on the United States. And the United States changed its goals. Instead of taking over Mexico's land, it wanted to help Mexico's economy. This ended the rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I did not know existed. I was a nurse at the time. I chose nursing because I wanted a safe and secure life. People told me, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" So, I became a nurse instead of a scientist or journalist.\n\nBut then I was sick. I was 46 years old and single. I had no money. To this day, I am sick and I get Social Security Disability. I have been getting it for 15 years. I have no money left that is mine. Every day is hard for me. I have to struggle to stay safe and feel good about myself.\n\nBut I know something is true. I would not have made it without my family and a few good friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong. \n\nMy point is that life can be hard. There are no guarantees. We cannot prepare for everything. \n\nI agree that we need to be careful with our government. But I think we should also learn to help each other. We should trust and ask for help instead of trying to do everything alone.\n\nConservatives say we are independent like our ancestors. But our ancestors did not succeed alone. They had compassion, respect and shared what they had. People who traveled across the country in wagons did not do it alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and supplies. I have food and water. But I also know my neighbors.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, biologist D'Arcy Thompson said it is hard to describe the shape of living things in simple language. Even today, it is still difficult. Recently, math has been used to study how animals grow their skeletons. Our study uses math and experiments to understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe looked at how shells grow in a type of sea snail called Prunum. We took pictures of the shells using X-rays. We then used these pictures to create math models of the shells. These models help us understand how the shells can change. We want to know how living things change over millions of years.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows as the animal moves through time. It grows in a circle, or spiral, around a center point. This center point is called the columella. The shell grows by adding new layers, or whorls. Each whorl is connected to the next by a line called a suture. The last whorl is the biggest one. The top of the shell is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, bottom, or the hole. We can also look at the edge of the shell. When we look at a shell, we can count the number of whorls. We start by looking at the top and finding where the first line is. Then we draw a line and count the whorls from there.\n\nA shell is like a series of holes that move through time as the animal grows. We can trace the path of the hole by looking at the center of each whorl. We can also look at the size of the hole. This helps us understand how the shell grows. We can use math to describe how the shell grows and change the math to see how the shell can change.",
            "Indonesia has not seen much change in the number of babies and small children who die in their first year.  The country is doing well in some areas, such as making clean water and toilets available.  But Indonesia is not making progress in keeping babies and mothers healthy.  The country has a long way to go to meet its goals by 2015.\n\nIn Indonesia, 72% of babies are born with a skilled health worker present.  But this number is not as good as it seems.  Some of these workers are midwives who cannot help if the mother has a problem during delivery.  This means many mothers die from heavy bleeding during childbirth.  The country must do more work in this area.\n\nThere are also problems with providing care for children who have diarrhea.  Few of these children see a health worker.  We do not have good information about taking care of new mothers after they have a baby.  But it is clear that this is a problem.\n\nMost women do not have surgery to help them deliver their babies.  Only 4% of women have a cesarean section.  This is too low.  In cities, 7% of women have a cesarean section.  But in rural areas, only 2% do.  This means that women in rural areas do not have access to good healthcare.  The country is not doing a good job of providing healthcare to people who need it most.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is that not everyone can get the healthcare they need.  People who are poor have a hard time getting care.  They may not have the money to pay for it.  There is a big difference in who gets care and who does not.  The rich get more care than the poor.\n\nTo improve the health of mothers and babies, the country must think about how to get more people healthcare.  Should the country focus on solving one problem at a time, or should it try to make the overall healthcare system better?  One way to solve a problem quickly is to focus on one area.  But this can be a problem if other areas do not get enough money or help.  This can cause problems and make things worse.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their details and stories about the rich people of that time. Two novels that are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting and help us understand their feelings and reasons for acting a certain way.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen often. These events give us information about Oliver's inner life. They show us what hurts him and what he thinks about the world around him.\n\nOne example is when Oliver is shot. In chapter 28, he relives the event in his mind. It is like a dream. He is trying to find help. Oliver is very sad and stressed because of the shooting. He does not have control over what happens to him.\n\nThe passage above shows that Oliver has little control over his life. He cannot even try to control the things that happen to him. This makes us think that Oliver feels defeated. It seems that the bad people in the story, like Fagin, are making Oliver give up. Oliver should try to save himself, but he does not.\n\nAnother example of a strange event is from Wuthering Heights. The author writes: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"\n\nIn this passage, the author is describing a long and scary night. The day and night seem to be mixed up. This creates a feeling of uncertainty and fear. The author is trying to show us how the characters feel in this situation.\n\nThese two novels use strange events to make their stories more interesting and to help us understand the characters better. They are different from other Victorian novels because they use mystery and strange events to create a more emotional and exciting story.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped children with their school work. I was good at helping them with English and reading. I worked with a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. He had trouble reading. I tried to help him, but it was hard. Some words he could read, but others he could not.\n\nI thought something was strange. He spoke perfect English, but he had trouble reading. He was from a Latino family. One day, his mother came to the program. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. I tried to talk to her, but I knew very little Spanish. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to talk about a big problem in schools. It is the language barrier. I think this problem exists everywhere, even in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading can still be hard. So, what can we do to help?\n\nIn Adrian's case, the answer was simple. He needed help with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one answer. We need to try many things. This includes the dual language system, where children learn two languages. This is a good idea. Children in this program do better in school.\n\nSome people are afraid to try the dual language system. They think it is not worth it. But this is not true. If we do this in all schools, all children will benefit. So, how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers, like tutors, who are bilingual.",
            "Most people are told as children that there is something big and powerful in the world. This something is often called God. Some people learn about God in Sunday school. Others learn about it in their own homes or in their own minds. Many people accept the ideas about God that their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in God. They think that there is no power beyond what we can see and understand.\n\nWe all try to learn about the world around us. We try to learn about ourselves, too. We find our own ways to believe in things that are bigger than we are. We try to find guidance in the dark times so that we can find peace and happiness.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so when I asked him about his favorite birds. We sat on our porch during a heavy rain. The sound of the rain on the roof was loud. We were smoking cigarettes and trying to talk.\n\nMy father looked out into the rain. He was thinking about something far away. He was sick and looked weak. He didn't want to talk about how sick he was. I was sad and afraid. I didn't want to think about losing him. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out into the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my birthday. He had cancer. The doctors tried to make him better, but they couldn't. I didn't want to see him die. I didn't want to watch the life that made me end. I wanted to remember my father for the good times, not the bad.\n\nI didn't visit him when he was dying. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news. No one called me to tell me that he had died.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a strange mix of old and new. Ian Watt describes it as an oxymoron, or a mix of words that are opposite. The Gothic style has been attacked and praised, accused of not being deep, and praised for its strong and powerful emotions.\n\nThe first Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's Castle of Otranto, took ideas from old and new stories. It mixed the excitement of old theatrical shows with the modern idea of a novel. Walpole used this mix to create a new way of writing.\n\nThe Gothic style uses things from the past, like medieval theater and buildings. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"Gothic\" was used to describe many things. It seemed old-fashioned compared to the new ideas in society and literature.\n\nThe mix of old and new ideas makes the Gothic style last a long time. It becomes old and new at the same time for readers.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a way of training a knight to be brave, honest, and strong. In the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is important because it shows what a good knight should be. The writer, Horace Walpole, was unhappy with the state of society and saw the Gothic era as a time when people were more moral.\n\nIn his writing, Walpole shows a character named Frederic who has many chivalric qualities. He is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be dead. The reader can see that he is a kind and gentle man who is very brave.\n\nThe character of Frederic is an example of the Gothic trope of excess, or things being too exaggerated. This is a common idea in Gothic stories.",
            "Supply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the raw materials, then to production, supply, and distribution to the customer. This process was first used in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver.\n\nThere are six important parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These parts work together to give the best service to customers.\n\nThe first part is production. This is the start of the supply chain process. Production is the foundation of the supply chain. It tells us when, why, where, and how products are made. To know what to make, managers look at the market. The market shows what customers want.\n\nAfter looking at the market, managers decide how many products to make and what products to make. They also decide where to make the products. This decision is based on the customer's demand and satisfaction. Next, managers plan the work and keep the equipment in good condition.\n\nProduction is a very important part of the supply chain. If one step is not planned, it can cost the company a lot of time and money. For example, a big company like Wal-Mart has a plan for everything, from an employee's uniform to receiving shipments. This plan helps the company work smoothly and on the right track.\n\nThe second part of the supply chain is supply. Supply is about making decisions that help a company find the right partners and equipment. A company may have different parts of production for one product. The manager must decide which part is best for the job. Sometimes, companies also work with other companies to make things. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "A message says Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, star of the movie Juno, holds a sign on a street corner. The sign says Burma, also known as Myanmar. This country is in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strong group of military leaders who took power in 1962. In 2007, many people protested in the streets. They were led by Buddhist monks. This event is called the Saffron Revolution. The monks wore red robes. The government at first let the monks gather, but then it became very violent. The military attacked the monasteries and arrested journalists. One journalist was killed in 2007. The government said 13 people died, but a military member who defected said many more died.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have tried to stop people from speaking out for a long time. The Roman leaders thought they were chosen by the gods. The Japanese emperor was believed to be a god. Some people think the current president of the United States has a special connection with a man who leads a group that wants to control the country.\n\nThere have been many bad examples of this. One example is the protest in China in 1989. Students, workers and intellectuals protested against the government. The death toll is not known exactly. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said many more died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their ethnic group. In World War II, many Jewish people were killed because of their religion.",
            "Duke Ellington's importance in jazz comes from his long life and creative abilities. He could shape his orchestra and make many great music pieces. Ellington often played the piano in his compositions, but as a composer, he made rich and complex music that showed the talents of each band member. He created a plan for the band to play very well together. He also wrote music with a special style for each band member. This made the orchestra sound good and original. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they worked well together. He wrote some of the most great music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington's music was special. He used the human voice like a musical instrument. This was new and different. He did this in a song called Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington added texture and color without using words. He knew how to make his soloists sound good. This is true for his whole career. Creole Love Call is a slow blues song with six parts. \n\nPart 1: The singer and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The singer starts with a smooth sound and ends with a rough sound.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a solo and makes the melody sound more interesting.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and high sound. The piano plays a special rhythm.\nPart 4: The whole band does what the singer and the woodwind instruments did in the first part.\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start talking and the brass and rhythm instruments play a special rhythm.\nPart 6: This part is like the first part. The singer sounds like a special instrument. \n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill to make the band sound tight. He also uses his ear to make the music sound good. In this song, the trumpet player and the singer work together to make a special sound. Another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), is also great. Ellington uses the trombone player to make the melody sound good. \n\nEllington's use of voice in music is an example of how he made his music special.",
            "She had always felt like something was missing. This feeling would not go away. It started when she was about 14 years old. Three years later, at 17, she still felt this way. By now, she had decided she wanted someone, not just something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys had tried to be friends with her, but none of them interested her. She often asked herself why she felt this way.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were kind and calm people. They rarely argued with each other. When they argued with her, it was usually about her strong personality. She was a calm person's daughter, but she was not calm. Her personality was fun and lively.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She walked from room to room, looking for something new. She heard a loud noise from the kitchen. Her mother was on the ground, hurting. The daughter ran to her side and asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother said, \"Ow... take me to the hospital.\" The daughter helped her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a sad place. There were bad smells and people who were sick. But she was not feeling sad. She was worried about her mother. She helped her mother to a bed and called for the doctors.

            "This study was done to see if eating a \"Mediterranean Diet\" can help prevent chronic heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean Diet is a special kind of diet that is high in plant foods and lower in animal products.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that people who eat a Mediterranean Diet are less likely to die from heart disease and other cardiovascular problems. But these studies did not look at stroke separately.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women who were part of a group of 121,700 nurses. The women were between 38 and 63 years old and did not have any heart disease or diabetes. They answered a food questionnaire six times between 1984 and 2004. They reported how often they ate certain foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and fish. They also reported how much animal products and saturated fats they ate.\n\nThe researchers looked at how often the women had heart disease or stroke over a 20-year period. They also looked at how often they exercised and other health factors.\n\nThe results showed that women who ate more of a Mediterranean Diet were less likely to get heart disease or stroke. They also found that these women were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke.\n\nThe researchers found that women who ate the most Mediterranean Diet food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They compared the risk of these women to women who ate the least Mediterranean Diet food. The women who ate more Mediterranean Diet food had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThis study suggests that eating a Mediterranean Diet can help prevent heart disease and stroke. It is a healthy diet that is high in plant foods and low in animal products.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and big companies had big problems. We need to know why this happened and how to stop it. The financial crisis was caused by bad and foolish actions by politicians. They made banks and companies give loans to people who could not pay them back. This happened in a country with a weak financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped to buy and sell these bad loans. When people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold the bad loans to others and this caused problems in the whole economy.\n\nThis problem started a long time ago, in 1999. The President wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular. So, he made it easier for people to get loans. This made the housing market look good for a while. But it was not good for the future. A reporter, Steven Holmes, wrote in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae is under pressure to give loans to people who cannot pay.\" He said that this could cause problems in the future. And it did.\n\nMany things helped to make the economy worse. New kinds of loans were created, like adjustable-rate mortgages. These loans were like a trap for people. They could not pay them back, and the banks lost a lot of money. The housing market was like a big balloon. It looked good, but it was going to burst. And it did. The top five big investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion dollars in debt in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some banks, like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, had big problems. They were sold cheap. Other banks had to change and become more careful.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion dollars in debt. They were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition: A Warning for Writers\n\nExposition is a problem for many writers. It is the part of a story where you tell the reader too much. You might think you are helping the reader, but you are not. You are making them bored.\n\nA good writer knows the rule \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes it is hard to follow. Dr. Merlin, a writer, knows what she is talking about. She says exposition can be like a devil on your shoulder, telling you to get the background information out of the way.\n\nIn writing, exposition is when you tell the reader what happened. It is like a character telling another character a lot of information. In a movie, it is when one actor talks to another about something that happened before the story started.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine a story where a woman's husband dies in front of her. You wouldn't want to read a whole page about it. You would want to see how the husband and wife were together and how much they loved each other. You would want to see how the woman felt when her husband died.\n\nA good writer will give you more information about the characters. They will show you how the husband loved his wife and how it changed her life. This way, you will feel sad when he dies and you will feel connected to the woman.\n\nAs a writer, you need to give your readers more than just the basics. You need to make them feel something. Don't rush through the parts of your story that are important. Take your time and make it real.",
            "I watched two news reports on TV from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was from NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man who hurt his wife in Ashley, Ohio. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. They spent a short time on this story. They said he hurt his wife several times and was arrested. I think they gave it enough time.\nThe next story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. No one was arrested yet. The police were working hard to find the person who did it. This story was short, and I think it was because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed this before - when a black person is a victim of a crime, it gets less attention. If a white person is a victim, the media talks about it a lot.\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. They said it was a small bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. The police are offering a reward to find the person who did it.\nThe weather report said it would rain on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be hot, around 80 degrees.\nThey also talked about a store that was robbed on Clime Road. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. They said he was tall and thin. They spent a lot of time saying he was black and how dark he was.\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was caught and sentenced to 25 years in prison. I do not think it was necessary to say he was Hispanic.",
            "Brothers have a special bond. This bond is strong and forever. It has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. These are just a few examples. Brothers understand each other better than people with other kinds of relationships. They see themselves in each other. When difficult situations happen, the true nature of this bond appears. It can be good or bad.\n\nWhen brothers feel these emotions, they come with a price. Understanding these feelings and their results is important. When a brother looks at another brother, he sees himself. He sees himself, not as others see him, but as he really is. His actions and their results show what kind of person he is.\n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers experience this brotherly bond. They go on a difficult journey. Pride and disappointment mix together in a strong way. Only one brother survives.\n\nThe story shows the true nature of the brothers through their actions and their feelings. The narrator helps us understand the brothers' complex emotions and their view of the world. This helps us understand their actions.\n\nOne brother's main feeling is pride. From the beginning, he feels unhappy with his little brother, Doodle. He wants a brother who can do things like run and climb. But Doodle is sick and cannot do these things. This makes the brother very sad and angry. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiles, he feels happy and wants to protect him. This shows that the brother loves his little brother.",
            "The human brain is a complicated system that processes information. As technology has improved, people have used different comparisons to describe the brain. At first, it was like a piece of wax that you could write on. Then it was compared to a piece of paper, and more recently to a computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons are not complete and can lead to wrong ideas.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses, such as our eyes, ears, and skin. This information is changed into signals that the brain can understand. The brain does this many times as it processes the information. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, the brain puts together small pieces of information, like color and shape, to decide that you are seeing a box.\n\nThe brain also uses the information from earlier steps to help you understand the information faster. This is called top-down processing. So, in the example, the brain uses the information it already knows to decide that you are seeing a black box, not a hole in the background.\n\nThe brain then decides which information is important and which processes to use it for. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain processes every blade of grass, but it does not show them to you. You might, however, hear your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information so that it can use it later. There are three kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, the brain must put the information into a form that it can use. For example, words can be stored in different ways, such as what the word looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means.\n\nOnce the information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies with animals suggest that working memory is kept by a signal that goes through a group of brain cells for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the shape of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to imagine how the brain stores knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, while others come from computer science and brain studies. One idea is that the brain has nodes that represent ideas, and the nodes are connected based on how they are related. For example, in this idea, the word \"chair\" is connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley is critical of the growing threat of technology and the capitalist system that supports it. He writes about this in his novel, Brave New World. In this world, people value their community above their individual freedom. They are taught to seek happiness above all else from a young age. The citizens are seen as pawns in a bigger game, controlled by the World Controller. By looking at the book through the ideas of Marxist thought, we can see that Huxley is concerned about the dangers of these systems.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism in his book. He uses ideas from Marxism to show how people are not aware of their true place in society. This is called false consciousness. The common people are not interested in understanding the relationship between different classes in society. They are interested in getting ahead and being happy. This is made easier by the World Controller, who controls what people think and do.\n\nThe different classes in Brave New World, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own ideas or desires. They are controlled by the World Controller. He uses hypnosis to make them want to buy and consume things. This is an example of a system where one group of people controls others. This is called hegemony. The lower classes do not even know they are being controlled. The upper classes know but do nothing to change it.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have real relationships with each other. They do not have deep emotions or connections. The characters in the book are not well-developed. This may be Huxley's way of showing that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and emotions. In the book, people do not feel love or strong emotions. They just have superficial relationships.\n\nThe way people accept their place in society shows the effects of capitalism. They are happy to be part of the system and do not question it. This is like the Marxist idea of the proletariat, who are happy to be part of the system as long as they can consume and be happy.",
            "I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year, I was in an East Halls dorm room. It is far from many classes. I had to walk a long time to get to class. Sometimes it took twenty-five minutes to walk from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building. The weather was often bad in State College.\n\nI talked to an older student. They told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were far from the rest of the school. Now, they are surrounded by new buildings and sports fields. The campus is getting bigger. It is harder to get around. What is the best way to solve this problem? I think the answer is the bicycle. But biking alone is not enough. We need to bike and the campus needs to be built for bikers.\n\nMy friend started biking again. He said, \"Bikes are great.\" He said it's the best way to get around. Biking is good for your body. It's the most efficient way to travel. You can go thirty miles with a little food and exercise. I live off campus. I have class in Thomas building. It's a twenty-five minute walk. But I can bike there in five minutes if I go fast. The problem is, Pollock Road is not easy to bike on. There are things to say for walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking would take extra time. I don't have time to walk."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

They may have trouble hearing a sound when another sound comes after it. They may have trouble putting together what they hear to understand what is happening.\n\nA doctor or therapist will check for CAPD using many tools. They may ask questions and watch how the person reacts to different sounds. This is not a simple test. There is no one test that works for everyone. There is no known cause for CAPD.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom. They can:\n\n- Give extra time for the student to answer questions.\n- Write important information on the board.\n- Use visual aids like pictures and charts.\n- Ask students to repeat what they hear.\n- Give the student a chance to listen to a question before answering.\n- Use assistive listening devices like headphones to help the student hear better.\n- Break down large tasks into smaller parts.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be helpful for a long time. But if you do not stop, you might lose yourself. One problem with stopping a lie is that you might hurt people who trust you. You must decide between keeping yourself safe or keeping your friends and family happy. Some people will not be angry if they discover a lie. Others will be very upset.\n\nUsing a disguise to pretend to be the opposite sex is a big issue. It brings up other problems. One question is, why do people want to change who they are? Viola wants to pretend to be a man to protect herself. She is new in a different place and needs to be careful.\n\nViola's plan works, but she has problems. She cannot be open with the women around her. She is very good at pretending to be a man. Olivia, another character, falls in love with Viola. Viola also has to deal with feelings for a man named Orsino.\n\nSome people might see Twelfth Night as a story about how deception can help people discover their true feelings. Olivia and Orsino might have feelings they do not want to show. Viola's disguise makes them think about these feelings. It is not clear if Olivia likes Viola because she thinks Viola is a man or if she really likes women. It is more likely that Olivia is making fun of people who judge others based on how they look. Olivia easily stops loving Viola and starts to see her as family.",
            "The German colonial rule in Africa was very brutal. Many people saw this in the way the Germans treated the Ovaherero and Nama people in South West Africa. But the German colonial empire was not like one big thing. It was different in many ways, like its geography and how it was ruled. Education in the colonies was also different. \n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many African people who were well-educated and could read. The Germans also did good work in Kamerun and other colonies, according to some writers. \n\nBut the situation in South West Africa was very different. The government did not help much with African education. Instead, it left this job to missionary groups. The government did, however, help the education of European people in the colony. They built schools and controlled the work of missionary schools. \n\nThis situation had a big effect on South West Africa long after the Germans left. While other colonies had many educated Africans, in South West Africa most people were uneducated and could not read. There were many reasons for this. This paper wants to look at these reasons. It also wants to talk about how settlers and colonial officials thought about African people.\n\nThere is a lot of writing about education in the German colonies. Most of these books are in German and were written a long time ago. They mostly told us about the educational systems in the different colonies. Later writers in English compared the education systems in the colonies and looked at special parts of education. They found that the educational systems were very different. One writer, Cohen, studied education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the large number of white settlers in South West Africa was one reason for its educational system. \n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land was desert. This meant that there were not many white settlers, but when there were, there were not very many. By 1913, only about 15,000 white people lived in South West Africa. This was not many compared to other colonies.",
            "Heavy Metal Music is a big group of music kinds. It has grown a lot over the past 100 years. Many new kinds of music have been added to the group. Most of these kinds of music, like rock and country, have their own smaller kinds inside them. One of the most interesting kinds of music in Heavy Metal is its ability to show a wide range of feelings. Most of these feelings are on the darker side. This means they are sad and serious.\n\nHeavy Metal started to get more flexible and diverse about 40 years ago. People started to create their own new kinds of Heavy Metal music. Then, even smaller kinds of music came from these new kinds. This process continues today. Many different groups make Heavy Metal music now. It is hard to say what Heavy Metal really is.\n\nTo understand Heavy Metal music, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement. Heavy Metal is a kind of music that is defined by its darkness. It is music with a lot of power and energy. People who make Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. They want to create a special kind of music that is different from other kinds.\n\nHeavy Metal music is also connected to the use of special kinds of drugs. In the 1970s, many people took these drugs and used them to create new kinds of music. This music was very different from other music at that time. Later, some groups took the dark and serious qualities of Heavy Metal from the Romantic music period. They used these qualities to make their own kind of music.\n\nSome songs from famous bands express the dark side of Heavy Metal music. These songs show how the music can be both good and bad at the same time. One example is a song called Helter Skelter by the Beatles. This song is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made in response to a song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau: The Dream\n\nA famous artist named Henri Rousseau painted a picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman looking at the amazing things she sees in a dream. But it is more than that. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted recognition and respect from other artists and people who love art. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know how.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in a town called Laval in northwest France. His father had a good job and was well-off. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for the government for many years. He was a customs inspector. But he loved to paint. After his wife and eight children died, he started to paint to make himself feel better. He wanted a new start in life.\n\nRousseau's problem was that he was working at the same time as many other good artists. They were famous before him. He did not get the recognition he wanted until he was older. A man named Matisse was also an artist. He and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and interesting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as an artist.\n\nThe Dream is a picture of Rousseau's struggle. He wanted to be like other artists, but he also wanted to be himself. This is a problem that many people face. Do you follow the crowd or be different?",
            "Many thinkers believe that ethics and beauty are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same thing. I agree with this idea. According to John Keats, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know comes from education or experience. But we seem to understand beauty and ethics without being taught. Both beauty and ethics try to explain things, not tell us what to do. We try to explain why art is beautiful or why an action is good, not give rules for making good art or behaving well.\n\nFor example, when we talk about the Mona Lisa, we might talk about the background and the contrast. But these things do not explain why it is a good painting. Often, when we talk about our favorite art, we say, \"There's just something about it.\" Then we try to explain more. I think that art and ethics are like this - we can't fully describe them. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We tell stories because a simple statement is not enough. We can't fully describe the qualities of a work of art or literature. There is something special that remains.\n\nI think that ethics and beauty are connected because we experience them in a special way. This is what philosophers call the \"noumenal\" level. We experience them, but can't fully explain them. This connection is strong when it comes to literature. Literature is a unique art form because of its moral quality. It is about values. We find values in literature and in life.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united and has a unique culture. This culture can be seen in the cities of München, near the Alps, and Kiel, near the Baltic Sea. The same culture is found in Köln, on the Rhine River, and in Dresden, on the Elbe River. Many people think Germany's culture comes from different tribes and sources.\n\nGermany's history began many years ago, in a land called Germania. The word \"German\" comes from an old language. One historian said it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were known as Germans before they moved to a new place and fought a war with other tribes.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans. He used the word \"German\" to say they were different from the people he had just conquered, called the Gauls. Caesar took the word from the Gauls. He said the Germans lived across the Rhine River and often fought battles.\n\nSome people think the word \"German\" comes from a spear called a \"ger\" or from an old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" It means the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said the Germans were the original people of the land and did not come from other places. He said they were not interested in leaving their land and going to other places like Italy.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They went to Germany to get goods and to fight battles. The Germanic tribes lived on the border of the Roman Empire and traded with the Romans.",
            "I looked down and saw a picture before me. My mind was not thinking about it. I was simply watching. My thoughts were moving in and out of my head very fast. It was like my brain was working smoothly without thinking much.\n\nI once learned from an artist's book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\". I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches many things about drawing, like how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines. One idea is to draw a square around a picture to make it simple. \n\nWhen I looked at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I could not imagine drawing a square around it. I was too surprised and amazed. I stood there and looked at it.\n\nPicasso liked blue, Monet liked green, and old Italian artists liked many colors. If I wanted to be an artist, I was starting to make my picture, my story, called \"Work in Brown\".\n\nI picked up a pencil and my hand moved to draw. My muscles were tight and then relaxed. My hand moved through the air and made a line on the paper. Water was flowing, smooth and calm. But then I was not thinking about art. I was trying to make the brown package on the toilet bowl move. It was stuck. I used a mop to try and move it, but it would not go away.\n\nI looked at the package with a frown. It was a dirty and strange thing. I used toilet paper to make a glove and then I put my hand in the bowl to try and get the package. It was a strange and unhappy moment.",
            "Teenagers die in car accidents. Several things cause this problem. One reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Many young drivers do not have enough experience. This causes more accidents and more people hurt or killed.\n\nDriving with friends is also a big problem. A study in California showed that the younger the passenger, the more accidents there are. California and other states try to make driving safer for teens. They give them special licenses that limit how many hours they can drive and do not allow other young people in the car.\n\nBut these licenses are not the answer. The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers of driving. A person named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young to drive. He did a study and found that young people like to take risks. They like to feel exciting. If we give them driver's licenses too early, more people will die in car accidents. In a few years, the number of deaths will be very high.\n\nBy the year 2010, many new teen drivers will be on the road. We need a law to keep young drivers safe. Schools can teach them how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car. Before they get a full license, they must have a certain number of hours of practice with a grown-up. This will help keep young drivers safe.\n\nWe should make a law to help keep young drivers safe all over the country. This is not a new idea. It is a good idea to help save lives.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I wanted to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of these films. They were made by Edison. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My film study looked at the way most of these films work. I also looked at the few trick films that break the usual rules.\n\nMost of the trick films are made in a stage setting. They do not move the camera. The camera stands still and looks straight ahead. This style of filming comes from theater and magic shows. The actors in these films do not move towards or away from the camera. They stay on the side and move back and forth.\n\nThe films are most often long shots or medium shots. Close-up shots are not used. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. They stay in the middle of the stage. The films are usually short, about a minute long. Most of them are tricks like magic and disappearing acts. They do not have a story. But sometimes, one shot can be many physical shots joined together to make an illusion.\n\nFor example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" we see Mary's head being cut off. But if we look closely, we see where the shot starts. The film is one shot in our eyes, but it is many physical shots.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a man who strongly supported Republicanism. He was a farmer, but his farming career and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best way to live, and this idea affected his thoughts about government, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government. The country had no old traditions to follow, so the people who created the government could make a new and fair system. He believed in natural rights, which are rights that all people should have. He thought these rights are connected, so if one right is taken away, all the others are not as valuable.\n\nTaylor said that in the natural world, people with strength and bad intentions often get what they want. But in a civilized society, this should not happen. To make a good society, Taylor thought the government should be made to deal with the good and bad parts of people. He believed in a simple system of good and bad. He said that good principles are those that protect people's property, make farming better, and do not allow too much capitalism. A government based on these principles would be fair, even if the people in charge are not.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is very limited and only has the powers the Constitution says it has. He did not want a big government because it would be expensive and might become mean. He thought a simple, straightforward reading of the Constitution could be bad if it does not consider the ideas behind the document. He also thought the Declaration of Independence was the most important document because it clearly says that the United States is a group of independent states, not one country.",
            "We look at the numbers from the project. In the third month, there was a big drop in people submitting their commuter logs. This was not what we wanted. We tried to understand why it happened. We thought the problem might be the cold weather. Fewer people walk or bike in the winter. The end of the school year in December is also a busy time. Some people do not even come to campus. They might forget to fill out the log. The holidays also started in December. People took a break from school. Classes started again in January. But even after that, the number of logs was low. We thought this might be because people get excited at first and then lose interest. We tried to stop this from happening. We made a special week, the Carpool Challenge Week, in March. We wanted to make the project interesting again. It worked. More people filled out the log. One problem with our project is that people like driving. It is part of our culture. To get people to use different ways to commute, we need to give them a reason. We gave out prizes like gift cards. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bicycle or a new car. This might have kept people interested. The prizes did not change during the project. If we had given out bigger prizes, it might have worked. The gift cards were good at first, but they did not help in the end.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that follows an index, a commodity or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. It gives you the benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning a single stock, like selling short or buying on margin. You can also buy as few as one share in any transaction. The costs of ETFs are much lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, you must pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, like you do on a stock order.\n\nETFs have many different kinds. This makes it easy to find one that fits your needs. But it is a good idea to examine the benefits you get from an ETF and how much you get. For this effort, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to know if the benefits of owning one ETF are as good as owning a group of 10 stocks. And if there are better ways to buy these stocks.\n\nWe will only look at the top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are these stocks and the percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will use their percentage of assets to calculate their effect on a portfolio's Beta and Return. We can do this by assuming a portfolio made up of these 10 stocks in the same proportion as the ETF. The results are in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a 16% higher return than the ETF. And its Beta would be 0.12 lower. This means that the portfolio could provide a higher return with less risk. But we need to know if these results are truly different.\n\nTo do this, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF. This will help us understand the risk of each portfolio.",
            "Poe's Poem \"Dream-Land\"\nPoe thought his poem \"Dream-Land\" was one of his best. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thulé\". Poe got \"Thulé\" from a famous writer named Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe a place north of Britain. People thought this place was the end of the world.\n\nBut Poe was also interested in German writers. One writer he liked was Goethe. Goethe wrote a poem called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. Poe was probably influenced by Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe's \"Faust\" includes a short poem about a king named Thule. This king's wife died, and he drank a lot and cried. He gave his things to his children and then went to a cliff and died. Poe's character in \"Dream-Land\" is similar to this king. He is sad and lonely.\n\nPoe used \"Thulé\" twice in his poem \"Dream-Land\". He also used it in his story \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe liked Goethe's work and was probably influenced by it. This is clear in his poem \"Dream-Land\".\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe respected. Poe liked another writer, Tennyson, and Tennyson liked Goethe. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of Tennyson. Poe also saw many copies of Goethe's work after it was first published.",
            "California law says a customer who was hurt after slipping and falling on applesauce in a grocery store may be able to get extra money from the store. This is because the store manager did not clean up the spill for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner at the time.\n\nA court is not likely to throw out the customer's claim for extra money. The customer must prove that the store manager acted with bad intentions. She must show that he was aware that not cleaning up the spill could hurt someone and still chose to do nothing. \n\nThe customer has evidence that the manager knew the spill was a danger. Several people had slipped and fallen in the store many times before she fell. The manager even knew about the previous accidents, but he still did not clean up the spill.\n\nThe customer will argue that the manager's actions were very bad. He was not just careless, but he showed a bad intention to ignore the danger. The customer will say that the manager's actions were bad because he knew about the danger and still did nothing to fix it.\n\nIn the past, six people had slipped and fallen in the store in one year. The manager still did not take care to keep the store safe. This will be a big part of the customer's argument.\n\nThe store manager was informed about the spill two times. The first time, he said he was on a break and did not have time to deal with it. The second time, he said the same thing. Thirty minutes later, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back.\n\nTo get extra money, the customer must prove that the store manager acted with bad intentions. The law in California says a person can get extra money from another person if they acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means acting with the intention to cause harm, or not intending to cause harm, but acting very badly and showing a disregard for other people's safety.\n\nA court has said that a person acts with malice when they know that their actions could cause harm, but they still choose to do nothing to stop it. In this case, the store manager knew that not cleaning up the spill could hurt someone, but he still did nothing. This will be a big part of the customer's argument.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC four years ago.  The main topic of our class discussions was whether Islam is a violent religion.  I think the question is more important now than ever.  After 9/11, I saw how the media changed its view of Islam.  Now, we see a lot of acceptance of Islam in America.  In 2001, I don't think we would have voted for a president like Barack Obama, who has a Muslim family background.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  It does not fit with what I thought I knew about him.  I thought he forced people to join Islam.  But the biography says he was a humble man who was misunderstood.  People came to believe in him because they saw the truth in his words.  \n\nThere are some similar things between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad took little food and made a lot for many people to eat.  The story of Muhammad makes me think that the writers wanted to show him as a humble man.  But this makes me think they are taking away from the life and miracles of Jesus.  It is like they are taking credit for Jesus' life.\n\nThe stories in the biography are often from other people's perspectives.  This makes me question the stories.  I don't like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI don't like how the biography tries to show Muhammad as a good man.

            "Christianity's teachings and beliefs moved away from their origin after Jesus' death.  We see this happening in history.  Christianity is moving farther from its original beliefs.  Many people still follow traditional ideas.  But more people are becoming aware and want to know more about the origin of their religion.  They want to know the true meaning of Jesus' teachings.\n\nThis movement will continue to grow.  People will want to separate the teachings of Jesus from the ideas that were added later.  It may take many years, but this is what will happen.  The true meaning of Christianity will come back to life.  People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus.  This will be a big change.  The church will stay strong, but the way people believe and live will become more alike.\n\nLook at history.  Many things have changed over time.  Once, Christians were treated badly by the Roman Empire.  But later, the empire became Christian.  Our country has changed, too.  Slavery was once a part of our country.  Now, African-Americans are leaders in our country.  This change will happen in the Christian church.\n\nTo make this change, people will learn to see Jesus' words as metaphors, not as rules.  So, what happened after Jesus' death?\n\nThe Jewish people were the first to believe in one God.  They were a special group of people.  They had different groups, like the Sadducees and Pharisees.

            "I think The Jungle shows that people are often selfish and only think of themselves. They want to make their own lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. The factory owners and managers are a good example. They just want to make their companies bigger and more successful. They do not care about people or animals that might be hurt by their actions. The owner of the factory in the book wants to make money, no matter what. He does not care about the pollution from his factory or the bad conditions where the animals live.\n\nThe owners and managers also do not treat their workers well. They work the workers very hard and do not give them fair pay or good working conditions. They just want to make more money. If the workers get hurt or sick, the owners do not care. They can just let them go without giving them any help.\n\nThe workers in the book are very unhappy. They are treated like slaves. They have to work very hard and do not have any protection. They are poor and do not have much power. The owners and managers are very powerful and do not care about the workers. This makes the workers very angry and unhappy.\n\nThe Jungle shows that some people are very selfish and do not care about others. They just want to make money and get ahead.

            "Many authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some ways are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs an adjective and a noun that do not usually fit together to make readers think of a certain idea. Other times, he gives a special meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose.\n\nFitzgerald uses this last way with many colors, including gold, green, white, and red. In his novel The Great Gatsby, he makes special meanings for colors, such as white and red. He uses these meanings to make readers remember a certain feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald makes for white is uniformity. White is a bit better and more important. Gray is more old and not as good. He shows this meaning at the beginning of the novel. Everyone is always wearing white: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white flannels, Tom wears a white shirt, and Catherine is very white.\n\nFitzgerald also gives a special meaning to gray. He makes gray mean old and not as good. In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his first impression of Gatsby's party. Fitzgerald also uses these colors for common, unimportant things: Nick goes down white streets in lower New York, gray names are on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is a gray apartment-house.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald makes these meanings clear, he uses them to show that something is not important. He starts with Daisy. He does not use these colors for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing white. Readers begin to see Daisy as not a special person, but just something Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique around Daisy to show that she is not special.\n\nHe also uses this technique with Tom and Gatsby. Tom and Gatsby are wearing gray clothes, and readers start to see them as old and not important. Fitzgerald makes readers see that these people are not special.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show readers that some people are not important. He shows that some people are just trying to be something they are not. He uses these colors to show readers that some people are just like everyone else.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The climate is mild and sunny. Many kinds of crops grow well there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. People want to buy food from local farms. Many farmers in San Diego grow food without using chemicals. They call this organic farming.\n\nThese farmers sell their food to people who want to eat healthy food. Some farmers also give tours of their farms. People can walk or hike on the farms. They can see birds and other animals. This can be a good way for farmers to make money.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This makes it easier for plants and animals to live there. But organic farming is not always easy. It needs more work to keep pests and weeds out and to make the soil healthy. It also costs more money than farming with chemicals.\n\nThe land chosen for this example is in San Diego County. It is next to a small town. The land is 160 acres. It is covered with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. Many kinds of plants and animals live there. Some are endangered. They include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. They were Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and wood sellers. The land was used for grazing and making wood for many years.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a website and looked at government programs that can help farmers.

            "Culture is an important part of any negotiation. Culture can be defined in many ways. It is not one thing, and it can be different for different people. We should not make broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too general and not true for every person. \n\nWhen we learn about a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. This helps us understand it better. To learn about a foreign culture, we can study its history, its values, and its way of thinking. We must accept a culture for what it is and work within its rules, especially when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation.\n\nA culture is not just about a country. Companies also have their own culture. For example, some companies value long work hours while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they work together. Even within the same country, different companies can have different cultures.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They explain why people make decisions. If saving face is important in a culture, a negotiator will not publicly disagree with others. If making a good deal is important, a negotiator will not settle quickly. Knowing these things can help a negotiator be more successful.\n\nBefore a negotiation, it is helpful to learn about the other person's culture and values. This way, we can be more effective in our negotiations.",

To compare their ideas, we will assume they are talking about the God of the Bible. \n\nTo understand their arguments, we need to look at each of their ideas. St. Anselm's argument is based on faith. He says that because we can imagine God, it is impossible for him not to exist. Anselm thinks we can find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. He believes the truth about God is already inside our minds, so we do not need external proof. This idea is often called faith in Christian teachings.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks the existence of God can be proven by using reason and evidence. He does not need faith to make his argument. Aquinas gives five reasons for believing in God. He says that change, cause, contingency, order, and harmony all need a higher power, God, to explain them. We can understand the existence of God by using logic.\n\nIn short, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas have different ways of understanding God. Anselm uses faith, while Aquinas uses reason and evidence.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. This prince would one day be called Buddha. Over his life, he gave up his position in the world and became very wise. He taught people, and his teachings led to the creation of a big group called Buddhism. This group is about twenty-five hundred years old. It looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. You can see this in the country of Sri Lanka. There, a special ceremony is held every year. Many people, including monks and regular people, take part in this ceremony. It has some religious importance, but it is not mentioned in Buddha's teachings.\n\nThe group of people who practice Theravada Buddhism has changed over time. This change is from the small things to the most important parts of the religion. The Theravada community has had to change its ideas over time. This happened because of forces both inside and outside the group. Sometimes these forces were good, and sometimes they were bad.\n\nThere are some important words we will use often in this discussion. When we talk about a force inside the Buddhist group, it means a force from someone who follows the Buddha's teachings. A force from someone who is not a Buddhist is outside the group. A bad force is something that hurts or wants to hurt the Buddhist group. A good force is something that does not want to hurt or help the group, but may do one of these things by accident.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basics of Buddhism. The most important ideas in Buddhism are the Triple Gem. The Triple Gem is the Buddha, the teachings, and the group of monks. The teachings are made up of three groups of text. One group has all the teachings of the Buddha. Another group has rules for living. The third group has ideas about the world and how it works. Some of these ideas are that there is no soul, life is suffering, and everything is changing.\n\nBy understanding these ideas, people can stop the never-ending cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. When people become wise, they will also stop desire, hatred, and delusion. The rules for living in Buddhism are found in the group of text that has rules. For people who are not monks, there are five rules. For monks, there are more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once rivals for 57 years. This was from 1836 to 1893. They had a major fight, the Mexican-American War, in 1846-1848. The United States won and got Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThese two countries had many disagreements. They disagreed about religion, culture and customs. They also had clashes over important things like money and resources. This is like many other countries that share a border.\n\nWhen countries share a border, they often have disagreements. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have long-lasting rivalries. They have a long history of problems.\n\nOne problem was about religion. Many years ago, Americans did not like Catholicism. This was a major issue between the two countries. It was like the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. But this was about religion, not politics.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many problems. They had 17 major disagreements from 1836 to 1893. Most of these were about land and border problems. There were many raids from Mexico into the United States. And there were problems on the border.\n\nAs time went on, the rivalry between the two countries decreased. Mexico became dependent on the United States. And the United States changed its goals. Instead of taking over Mexico's land, it wanted to help Mexico's economy. This ended the rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with an illness I did not know existed. I was a nurse at the time. I chose nursing because I wanted a safe and secure life. People told me, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" So, I became a nurse instead of a scientist or journalist.\n\nBut then I was sick. I was 46 years old and single. I had no money. To this day, I am sick and I get Social Security Disability. I have been getting it for 15 years. I have no money left that is mine. Every day is hard for me. I have to struggle to stay safe and feel good about myself.\n\nBut I know something is true. I would not have made it without my family and a few good friends. When bad things happen, you do not feel strong. \n\nMy point is that life can be hard. There are no guarantees. We cannot prepare for everything. \n\nI agree that we need to be careful with our government. But I think we should also learn to help each other. We should trust and ask for help instead of trying to do everything alone.\n\nConservatives say we are independent like our ancestors. But our ancestors did not succeed alone. They had compassion, respect and shared what they had. People who traveled across the country in wagons did not do it alone.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a disaster kit and supplies. I have food and water. But I also know my neighbors.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? In 1917, biologist D'Arcy Thompson said it is hard to describe the shape of living things in simple language. Even today, it is still difficult. Recently, math has been used to study how animals grow their skeletons. Our study uses math and experiments to understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe looked at how shells grow in a type of sea snail called Prunum. We took pictures of the shells using X-rays. We then used these pictures to create math models of the shells. These models help us understand how the shells can change. We want to know how living things change over millions of years.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows as the animal moves through time. It grows in a circle, or spiral, around a center point. This center point is called the columella. The shell grows by adding new layers, or whorls. Each whorl is connected to the next by a line called a suture. The last whorl is the biggest one. The top of the shell is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, bottom, or the hole. We can also look at the edge of the shell. When we look at a shell, we can count the number of whorls. We start by looking at the top and finding where the first line is. Then we draw a line and count the whorls from there.\n\nA shell is like a series of holes that move through time as the animal grows. We can trace the path of the hole by looking at the center of each whorl. We can also look at the size of the hole. This helps us understand how the shell grows. We can use math to describe how the shell grows and change the math to see how the shell can change.",
            "Indonesia has not seen much change in the number of babies and small children who die in their first year.  The country is doing well in some areas, such as making clean water and toilets available.  But Indonesia is not making progress in keeping babies and mothers healthy.  The country has a long way to go to meet its goals by 2015.\n\nIn Indonesia, 72% of babies are born with a skilled health worker present.  But this number is not as good as it seems.  Some of these workers are midwives who cannot help if the mother has a problem during delivery.  This means many mothers die from heavy bleeding during childbirth.  The country must do more work in this area.\n\nThere are also problems with providing care for children who have diarrhea.  Few of these children see a health worker.  We do not have good information about taking care of new mothers after they have a baby.  But it is clear that this is a problem.\n\nMost women do not have surgery to help them deliver their babies.  Only 4% of women have a cesarean section.  This is too low.  In cities, 7% of women have a cesarean section.  But in rural areas, only 2% do.  This means that women in rural areas do not have access to good healthcare.  The country is not doing a good job of providing healthcare to people who need it most.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is that not everyone can get the healthcare they need.  People who are poor have a hard time getting care.  They may not have the money to pay for it.  There is a big difference in who gets care and who does not.  The rich get more care than the poor.\n\nTo improve the health of mothers and babies, the country must think about how to get more people healthcare.  Should the country focus on solving one problem at a time, or should it try to make the overall healthcare system better?  One way to solve a problem quickly is to focus on one area.  But this can be a problem if other areas do not get enough money or help.  This can cause problems and make things worse.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their details and stories about the rich people of that time. Two novels that are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting and help us understand their feelings and reasons for acting a certain way.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen often. These events give us information about Oliver's inner life. They show us what hurts him and what he thinks about the world around him.\n\nOne example is when Oliver is shot. In chapter 28, he relives the event in his mind. It is like a dream. He is trying to find help. Oliver is very sad and stressed because of the shooting. He does not have control over what happens to him.\n\nThe passage above shows that Oliver has little control over his life. He cannot even try to control the things that happen to him. This makes us think that Oliver feels defeated. It seems that the bad people in the story, like Fagin, are making Oliver give up. Oliver should try to save himself, but he does not.\n\nAnother example of a strange event is from Wuthering Heights. The author writes: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"\n\nIn this passage, the author is describing a long and scary night. The day and night seem to be mixed up. This creates a feeling of uncertainty and fear. The author is trying to show us how the characters feel in this situation.\n\nThese two novels use strange events to make their stories more interesting and to help us understand the characters better. They are different from other Victorian novels because they use mystery and strange events to create a more emotional and exciting story.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped children with their school work. I was good at helping them with English and reading. I worked with a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. He had trouble reading. I tried to help him, but it was hard. Some words he could read, but others he could not.\n\nI thought something was strange. He spoke perfect English, but he had trouble reading. He was from a Latino family. One day, his mother came to the program. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. I tried to talk to her, but I knew very little Spanish. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to talk about a big problem in schools. It is the language barrier. I think this problem exists everywhere, even in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading can still be hard. So, what can we do to help?\n\nIn Adrian's case, the answer was simple. He needed help with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one answer. We need to try many things. This includes the dual language system, where children learn two languages. This is a good idea. Children in this program do better in school.\n\nSome people are afraid to try the dual language system. They think it is not worth it. But this is not true. If we do this in all schools, all children will benefit. So, how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers, like tutors, who are bilingual.",
            "Most people are told as children that there is something big and powerful in the world. This something is often called God. Some people learn about God in Sunday school. Others learn about it in their own homes or in their own minds. Many people accept the ideas about God that their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in God. They think that there is no power beyond what we can see and understand.\n\nWe all try to learn about the world around us. We try to learn about ourselves, too. We find our own ways to believe in things that are bigger than we are. We try to find guidance in the dark times so that we can find peace and happiness.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so when I asked him about his favorite birds. We sat on our porch during a heavy rain. The sound of the rain on the roof was loud. We were smoking cigarettes and trying to talk.\n\nMy father looked out into the rain. He was thinking about something far away. He was sick and looked weak. He didn't want to talk about how sick he was. I was sad and afraid. I didn't want to think about losing him. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out into the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my birthday. He had cancer. The doctors tried to make him better, but they couldn't. I didn't want to see him die. I didn't want to watch the life that made me end. I wanted to remember my father for the good times, not the bad.\n\nI didn't visit him when he was dying. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news. No one called me to tell me that he had died.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a strange mix of old and new. Ian Watt describes it as an oxymoron, or a mix of words that are opposite. The Gothic style has been attacked and praised, accused of not being deep, and praised for its strong and powerful emotions.\n\nThe first Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's Castle of Otranto, took ideas from old and new stories. It mixed the excitement of old theatrical shows with the modern idea of a novel. Walpole used this mix to create a new way of writing.\n\nThe Gothic style uses things from the past, like medieval theater and buildings. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"Gothic\" was used to describe many things. It seemed old-fashioned compared to the new ideas in society and literature.\n\nThe mix of old and new ideas makes the Gothic style last a long time. It becomes old and new at the same time for readers.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a way of training a knight to be brave, honest, and strong. In the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is important because it shows what a good knight should be. The writer, Horace Walpole, was unhappy with the state of society and saw the Gothic era as a time when people were more moral.\n\nIn his writing, Walpole shows a character named Frederic who has many chivalric qualities. He is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be dead. The reader can see that he is a kind and gentle man who is very brave.\n\nThe character of Frederic is an example of the Gothic trope of excess, or things being too exaggerated. This is a common idea in Gothic stories.",
            "Supply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the raw materials, then to production, supply, and distribution to the customer. This process was first used in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver.\n\nThere are six important parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These parts work together to give the best service to customers.\n\nThe first part is production. This is the start of the supply chain process. Production is the foundation of the supply chain. It tells us when, why, where, and how products are made. To know what to make, managers look at the market. The market shows what customers want.\n\nAfter looking at the market, managers decide how many products to make and what products to make. They also decide where to make the products. This decision is based on the customer's demand and satisfaction. Next, managers plan the work and keep the equipment in good condition.\n\nProduction is a very important part of the supply chain. If one step is not planned, it can cost the company a lot of time and money. For example, a big company like Wal-Mart has a plan for everything, from an employee's uniform to receiving shipments. This plan helps the company work smoothly and on the right track.\n\nThe second part of the supply chain is supply. Supply is about making decisions that help a company find the right partners and equipment. A company may have different parts of production for one product. The manager must decide which part is best for the job. Sometimes, companies also work with other companies to make things. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "A message says Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, star of the movie Juno, holds a sign on a street corner. The sign says Burma, also known as Myanmar. This country is in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strong group of military leaders who took power in 1962. In 2007, many people protested in the streets. They were led by Buddhist monks. This event is called the Saffron Revolution. The monks wore red robes. The government at first let the monks gather, but then it became very violent. The military attacked the monasteries and arrested journalists. One journalist was killed in 2007. The government said 13 people died, but a military member who defected said many more died.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have tried to stop people from speaking out for a long time. The Roman leaders thought they were chosen by the gods. The Japanese emperor was believed to be a god. Some people think the current president of the United States has a special connection with a man who leads a group that wants to control the country.\n\nThere have been many bad examples of this. One example is the protest in China in 1989. Students, workers and intellectuals protested against the government. The death toll is not known exactly. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said many more died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their ethnic group. In World War II, many Jewish people were killed because of their religion.",
            "Duke Ellington's importance in jazz comes from his long life and creative abilities. He could shape his orchestra and make many great music pieces. Ellington often played the piano in his compositions, but as a composer, he made rich and complex music that showed the talents of each band member. He created a plan for the band to play very well together. He also wrote music with a special style for each band member. This made the orchestra sound good and original. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they worked well together. He wrote some of the most great music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington's music was special. He used the human voice like a musical instrument. This was new and different. He did this in a song called Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington added texture and color without using words. He knew how to make his soloists sound good. This is true for his whole career. Creole Love Call is a slow blues song with six parts. \n\nPart 1: The singer and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The singer starts with a smooth sound and ends with a rough sound.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a solo and makes the melody sound more interesting.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and high sound. The piano plays a special rhythm.\nPart 4: The whole band does what the singer and the woodwind instruments did in the first part.\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start talking and the brass and rhythm instruments play a special rhythm.\nPart 6: This part is like the first part. The singer sounds like a special instrument. \n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill to make the band sound tight. He also uses his ear to make the music sound good. In this song, the trumpet player and the singer work together to make a special sound. Another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), is also great. Ellington uses the trombone player to make the melody sound good. \n\nEllington's use of voice in music is an example of how he made his music special.",
            "She had always felt like something was missing. This feeling would not go away. It started when she was about 14 years old. Three years later, at 17, she still felt this way. By now, she had decided she wanted someone, not just something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys had tried to be friends with her, but none of them interested her. She often asked herself why she felt this way.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were kind and calm people. They rarely argued with each other. When they argued with her, it was usually about her strong personality. She was a calm person's daughter, but she was not calm. Her personality was fun and lively.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She walked from room to room, looking for something new. She heard a loud noise from the kitchen. Her mother was on the ground, hurting. The daughter ran to her side and asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother said, \"Ow... take me to the hospital.\" The daughter helped her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a sad place. There were bad smells and people who were sick. But she was not feeling sad. She was worried about her mother. She helped her mother to a bed and called for the doctors.

            "This study was done to see if eating a \"Mediterranean Diet\" can help prevent chronic heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean Diet is a special kind of diet that is high in plant foods and lower in animal products.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that people who eat a Mediterranean Diet are less likely to die from heart disease and other cardiovascular problems. But these studies did not look at stroke separately.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women who were part of a group of 121,700 nurses. The women were between 38 and 63 years old and did not have any heart disease or diabetes. They answered a food questionnaire six times between 1984 and 2004. They reported how often they ate certain foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and fish. They also reported how much animal products and saturated fats they ate.\n\nThe researchers looked at how often the women had heart disease or stroke over a 20-year period. They also looked at how often they exercised and other health factors.\n\nThe results showed that women who ate more of a Mediterranean Diet were less likely to get heart disease or stroke. They also found that these women were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke.\n\nThe researchers found that women who ate the most Mediterranean Diet food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They compared the risk of these women to women who ate the least Mediterranean Diet food. The women who ate more Mediterranean Diet food had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThis study suggests that eating a Mediterranean Diet can help prevent heart disease and stroke. It is a healthy diet that is high in plant foods and low in animal products.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and big companies had big problems. We need to know why this happened and how to stop it. The financial crisis was caused by bad and foolish actions by politicians. They made banks and companies give loans to people who could not pay them back. This happened in a country with a weak financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped to buy and sell these bad loans. When people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold the bad loans to others and this caused problems in the whole economy.\n\nThis problem started a long time ago, in 1999. The President wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular. So, he made it easier for people to get loans. This made the housing market look good for a while. But it was not good for the future. A reporter, Steven Holmes, wrote in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae is under pressure to give loans to people who cannot pay.\" He said that this could cause problems in the future. And it did.\n\nMany things helped to make the economy worse. New kinds of loans were created, like adjustable-rate mortgages. These loans were like a trap for people. They could not pay them back, and the banks lost a lot of money. The housing market was like a big balloon. It looked good, but it was going to burst. And it did. The top five big investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion dollars in debt in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some banks, like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, had big problems. They were sold cheap. Other banks had to change and become more careful.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion dollars in debt. They were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition: A Warning for Writers\n\nExposition is a problem for many writers. It is the part of a story where you tell the reader too much. You might think you are helping the reader, but you are not. You are making them bored.\n\nA good writer knows the rule \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes it is hard to follow. Dr. Merlin, a writer, knows what she is talking about. She says exposition can be like a devil on your shoulder, telling you to get the background information out of the way.\n\nIn writing, exposition is when you tell the reader what happened. It is like a character telling another character a lot of information. In a movie, it is when one actor talks to another about something that happened before the story started.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine a story where a woman's husband dies in front of her. You wouldn't want to read a whole page about it. You would want to see how the husband and wife were together and how much they loved each other. You would want to see how the woman felt when her husband died.\n\nA good writer will give you more information about the characters. They will show you how the husband loved his wife and how it changed her life. This way, you will feel sad when he dies and you will feel connected to the woman.\n\nAs a writer, you need to give your readers more than just the basics. You need to make them feel something. Don't rush through the parts of your story that are important. Take your time and make it real.",
            "I watched two news reports on TV from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was from NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man who hurt his wife in Ashley, Ohio. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. They spent a short time on this story. They said he hurt his wife several times and was arrested. I think they gave it enough time.\nThe next story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. No one was arrested yet. The police were working hard to find the person who did it. This story was short, and I think it was because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed this before - when a black person is a victim of a crime, it gets less attention. If a white person is a victim, the media talks about it a lot.\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. They said it was a small bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. The police are offering a reward to find the person who did it.\nThe weather report said it would rain on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be hot, around 80 degrees.\nThey also talked about a store that was robbed on Clime Road. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. They said he was tall and thin. They spent a lot of time saying he was black and how dark he was.\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was caught and sentenced to 25 years in prison. I do not think it was necessary to say he was Hispanic.",
            "Brothers have a special bond. This bond is strong and forever. It has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. These are just a few examples. Brothers understand each other better than people with other kinds of relationships. They see themselves in each other. When difficult situations happen, the true nature of this bond appears. It can be good or bad.\n\nWhen brothers feel these emotions, they come with a price. Understanding these feelings and their results is important. When a brother looks at another brother, he sees himself. He sees himself, not as others see him, but as he really is. His actions and their results show what kind of person he is.\n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers experience this brotherly bond. They go on a difficult journey. Pride and disappointment mix together in a strong way. Only one brother survives.\n\nThe story shows the true nature of the brothers through their actions and their feelings. The narrator helps us understand the brothers' complex emotions and their view of the world. This helps us understand their actions.\n\nOne brother's main feeling is pride. From the beginning, he feels unhappy with his little brother, Doodle. He wants a brother who can do things like run and climb. But Doodle is sick and cannot do these things. This makes the brother very sad and angry. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiles, he feels happy and wants to protect him. This shows that the brother loves his little brother.",
            "The human brain is a complicated system that processes information. As technology has improved, people have used different comparisons to describe the brain. At first, it was like a piece of wax that you could write on. Then it was compared to a piece of paper, and more recently to a computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons are not complete and can lead to wrong ideas.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses, such as our eyes, ears, and skin. This information is changed into signals that the brain can understand. The brain does this many times as it processes the information. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, the brain puts together small pieces of information, like color and shape, to decide that you are seeing a box.\n\nThe brain also uses the information from earlier steps to help you understand the information faster. This is called top-down processing. So, in the example, the brain uses the information it already knows to decide that you are seeing a black box, not a hole in the background.\n\nThe brain then decides which information is important and which processes to use it for. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain processes every blade of grass, but it does not show them to you. You might, however, hear your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information so that it can use it later. There are three kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, the brain must put the information into a form that it can use. For example, words can be stored in different ways, such as what the word looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means.\n\nOnce the information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies with animals suggest that working memory is kept by a signal that goes through a group of brain cells for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the shape of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to imagine how the brain stores knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, while others come from computer science and brain studies. One idea is that the brain has nodes that represent ideas, and the nodes are connected based on how they are related. For example, in this idea, the word \"chair\" is connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley is critical of the growing threat of technology and the capitalist system that supports it. He writes about this in his novel, Brave New World. In this world, people value their community above their individual freedom. They are taught to seek happiness above all else from a young age. The citizens are seen as pawns in a bigger game, controlled by the World Controller. By looking at the book through the ideas of Marxist thought, we can see that Huxley is concerned about the dangers of these systems.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism in his book. He uses ideas from Marxism to show how people are not aware of their true place in society. This is called false consciousness. The common people are not interested in understanding the relationship between different classes in society. They are interested in getting ahead and being happy. This is made easier by the World Controller, who controls what people think and do.\n\nThe different classes in Brave New World, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own ideas or desires. They are controlled by the World Controller. He uses hypnosis to make them want to buy and consume things. This is an example of a system where one group of people controls others. This is called hegemony. The lower classes do not even know they are being controlled. The upper classes know but do nothing to change it.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have real relationships with each other. They do not have deep emotions or connections. The characters in the book are not well-developed. This may be Huxley's way of showing that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and emotions. In the book, people do not feel love or strong emotions. They just have superficial relationships.\n\nThe way people accept their place in society shows the effects of capitalism. They are happy to be part of the system and do not question it. This is like the Marxist idea of the proletariat, who are happy to be part of the system as long as they can consume and be happy.",
            "I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year, I was in an East Halls dorm room. It is far from many classes. I had to walk a long time to get to class. Sometimes it took twenty-five minutes to walk from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building. The weather was often bad in State College.\n\nI talked to an older student. They told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were far from the rest of the school. Now, they are surrounded by new buildings and sports fields. The campus is getting bigger. It is harder to get around. What is the best way to solve this problem? I think the answer is the bicycle. But biking alone is not enough. We need to bike and the campus needs to be built for bikers.\n\nMy friend started biking again. He said, \"Bikes are great.\" He said it's the best way to get around. Biking is good for your body. It's the most efficient way to travel. You can go thirty miles with a little food and exercise. I live off campus. I have class in Thomas building. It's a twenty-five minute walk. But I can bike there in five minutes if I go fast. The problem is, Pollock Road is not easy to bike on. There are things to say for walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking would take extra time. I don't have time to walk."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table.

            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Most of these kinds of music, like rock and country, have their own smaller kinds inside them. One of the most interesting kinds of music in Heavy Metal is its ability to show a wide range of feelings. Most of these feelings are on the darker side. This means they are sad and serious.\n\nHeavy Metal started to get more flexible and diverse about 40 years ago. People started to create their own new kinds of Heavy Metal music. Then, even smaller kinds of music came from these new kinds. This process continues today. Many different groups make Heavy Metal music now. It is hard to say what Heavy Metal really is.\n\nTo understand Heavy Metal music, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement. Heavy Metal is a kind of music that is defined by its darkness. It is music with a lot of power and energy. People who make Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. They want to create a special kind of music that is different from other kinds.\n\nHeavy Metal music is also connected to the use of special kinds of drugs. In the 1970s, many people took these drugs and used them to create new kinds of music. This music was very different from other music at that time. Later, some groups took the dark and serious qualities of Heavy Metal from the Romantic music period. They used these qualities to make their own kind of music.\n\nSome songs from famous bands express the dark side of Heavy Metal music.

This painting shows a woman looking at the amazing things she sees in a dream. But it is more than that. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted recognition and respect from other artists and people who love art. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not know how.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in a town called Laval in northwest France. His father had a good job and was well-off. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for the government for many years. He was a customs inspector. But he loved to paint. After his wife and eight children died, he started to paint to make himself feel better. He wanted a new start in life.\n\nRousseau's problem was that he was working at the same time as many other good artists. They were famous before him. He did not get the recognition he wanted until he was older. A man named Matisse was also an artist. He and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and interesting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as an artist.\n\nThe Dream is a picture of Rousseau's struggle. He wanted to be like other artists, but he also wanted to be himself. This is a problem that many people face. Do you follow the crowd or be different?",
            "Many thinkers believe that ethics and beauty are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same thing. I agree with this idea. According to John Keats, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know comes from education or experience. But we seem to understand beauty and ethics without being taught. Both beauty and ethics try to explain things, not tell us what to do. We try to explain why art is beautiful or why an action is good, not give rules for making good art or behaving well.\n\nFor example, when we talk about the Mona Lisa, we might talk about the background and the contrast. But these things do not explain why it is a good painting. Often, when we talk about our favorite art, we say, \"There's just something about it.\" Then we try to explain more. I think that art and ethics are like this - we can't fully describe them. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We tell stories because a simple statement is not enough. We can't fully describe the qualities of a work of art or literature. There is something special that remains.\n\nI think that ethics and beauty are connected because we experience them in a special way. This is what philosophers call the \"noumenal\" level. We experience them, but can't fully explain them. This connection is strong when it comes to literature. Literature is a unique art form because of its moral quality. It is about values. We find values in literature and in life.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united and has a unique culture. This culture can be seen in the cities of München, near the Alps, and Kiel, near the Baltic Sea. The same culture is found in Köln, on the Rhine River, and in Dresden, on the Elbe River. Many people think Germany's culture comes from different tribes and sources.\n\nGermany's history began many years ago, in a land called Germania. The word \"German\" comes from an old language. One historian said it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were known as Germans before they moved to a new place and fought a war with other tribes.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans. He used the word \"German\" to say they were different from the people he had just conquered, called the Gauls. Caesar took the word from the Gauls. He said the Germans lived across the Rhine River and often fought battles.\n\nSome people think the word \"German\" comes from a spear called a \"ger\" or from an old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" It means the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said the Germans were the original people of the land and did not come from other places. He said they were not interested in leaving their land and going to other places like Italy.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They went to Germany to get goods and to fight battles. The Germanic tribes lived on the border of the Roman Empire and traded with the Romans.",
            "I looked down and saw a picture before me. My mind was not thinking about it. I was simply watching. My thoughts were moving in and out of my head very fast. It was like my brain was working smoothly without thinking much.\n\nI once learned from an artist's book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\". I wanted to learn to draw since I was six years old. The book teaches many things about drawing, like how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines. One idea is to draw a square around a picture to make it simple. \n\nWhen I looked at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I could not imagine drawing a square around it. I was too surprised and amazed. I stood there and looked at it.\n\nPicasso liked blue, Monet liked green, and old Italian artists liked many colors. If I wanted to be an artist, I was starting to make my picture, my story, called \"Work in Brown\".\n\nI picked up a pencil and my hand moved to draw. My muscles were tight and then relaxed. My hand moved through the air and made a line on the paper. Water was flowing, smooth and calm. But then I was not thinking about art. I was trying to make the brown package on the toilet bowl move. It was stuck. I used a mop to try and move it, but it would not go away.\n\nI looked at the package with a frown. It was a dirty and strange thing. I used toilet paper to make a glove and then I put my hand in the bowl to try and get the package. It was a strange and unhappy moment.",
            "Teenagers die in car accidents. Several things cause this problem. One reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Many young drivers do not have enough experience. This causes more accidents and more people hurt or killed.\n\nDriving with friends is also a big problem. A study in California showed that the younger the passenger, the more accidents there are. California and other states try to make driving safer for teens. They give them special licenses that limit how many hours they can drive and do not allow other young people in the car.\n\nBut these licenses are not the answer. The real problem is that young drivers are not good at handling the dangers of driving. A person named Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young to drive. He did a study and found that young people like to take risks. They like to feel exciting. If we give them driver's licenses too early, more people will die in car accidents. In a few years, the number of deaths will be very high.\n\nBy the year 2010, many new teen drivers will be on the road. We need a law to keep young drivers safe. Schools can teach them how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car. Before they get a full license, they must have a certain number of hours of practice with a grown-up. This will help keep young drivers safe.\n\nWe should make a law to help keep young drivers safe all over the country. This is not a new idea. It is a good idea to help save lives.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I wanted to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of these films. They were made by Edison. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My film study looked at the way most of these films work. I also looked at the few trick films that break the usual rules.\n\nMost of the trick films are made in a stage setting. They do not move the camera. The camera stands still and looks straight ahead. This style of filming comes from theater and magic shows. The actors in these films do not move towards or away from the camera. They stay on the side and move back and forth.\n\nThe films are most often long shots or medium shots. Close-up shots are not used. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. They stay in the middle of the stage. The films are usually short, about a minute long. Most of them are tricks like magic and disappearing acts. They do not have a story. But sometimes, one shot can be many physical shots joined together to make an illusion.\n\nFor example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" we see Mary's head being cut off. But if we look closely, we see where the shot starts. The film is one shot in our eyes, but it is many physical shots.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a man who strongly supported Republicanism. He was a farmer, but his farming career and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best way to live, and this idea affected his thoughts about government, the Constitution, and the courts.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a good chance to create a perfect system of government. The country had no old traditions to follow, so the people who created the government could make a new and fair system. He believed in natural rights, which are rights that all people should have. He thought these rights are connected, so if one right is taken away, all the others are not as valuable.\n\nTaylor said that in the natural world, people with strength and bad intentions often get what they want. But in a civilized society, this should not happen. To make a good society, Taylor thought the government should be made to deal with the good and bad parts of people. He believed in a simple system of good and bad. He said that good principles are those that protect people's property, make farming better, and do not allow too much capitalism. A government based on these principles would be fair, even if the people in charge are not.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is very limited and only has the powers the Constitution says it has. He did not want a big government because it would be expensive and might become mean. He thought a simple, straightforward reading of the Constitution could be bad if it does not consider the ideas behind the document. He also thought the Declaration of Independence was the most important document because it clearly says that the United States is a group of independent states, not one country.",
            "We look at the numbers from the project. In the third month, there was a big drop in people submitting their commuter logs. This was not what we wanted. We tried to understand why it happened. We thought the problem might be the cold weather. Fewer people walk or bike in the winter. The end of the school year in December is also a busy time. Some people do not even come to campus. They might forget to fill out the log. The holidays also started in December. People took a break from school. Classes started again in January. But even after that, the number of logs was low. We thought this might be because people get excited at first and then lose interest. We tried to stop this from happening. We made a special week, the Carpool Challenge Week, in March. We wanted to make the project interesting again. It worked. More people filled out the log. One problem with our project is that people like driving. It is part of our culture. To get people to use different ways to commute, we need to give them a reason. We gave out prizes like gift cards. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bicycle or a new car. This might have kept people interested. The prizes did not change during the project. If we had given out bigger prizes, it might have worked. The gift cards were good at first, but they did not help in the end.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that follows an index, a commodity or a group of assets like an index fund. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. It gives you the benefits of an index fund and the advantages of owning a single stock, like selling short or buying on margin. You can also buy as few as one share in any transaction. The costs of ETFs are much lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, you must pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, like you do on a stock order.\n\nETFs have many different kinds. This makes it easy to find one that fits your needs. But it is a good idea to examine the benefits you get from an ETF and how much you get. For this effort, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to know if the benefits of owning one ETF are as good as owning a group of 10 stocks. And if there are better ways to buy these stocks.\n\nWe will only look at the top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are these stocks and the percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will use their percentage of assets to calculate their effect on a portfolio's Beta and Return. We can do this by assuming a portfolio made up of these 10 stocks in the same proportion as the ETF. The results are in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a 16% higher return than the ETF. And its Beta would be 0.12 lower. This means that the portfolio could provide a higher return with less risk. But we need to know if these results are truly different.\n\nTo do this, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF. This will help us understand the risk of each portfolio.",
            "Poe's Poem \"Dream-Land\"\nPoe thought his poem \"Dream-Land\" was one of his best. In this poem, he uses the word \"Thulé\". Poe got \"Thulé\" from a famous writer named Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe a place north of Britain. People thought this place was the end of the world.\n\nBut Poe was also interested in German writers. One writer he liked was Goethe. Goethe wrote a poem called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts. Poe was probably influenced by Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe's \"Faust\" includes a short poem about a king named Thule. This king's wife died, and he drank a lot and cried. He gave his things to his children and then went to a cliff and died. Poe's character in \"Dream-Land\" is similar to this king. He is sad and lonely.\n\nPoe used \"Thulé\" twice in his poem \"Dream-Land\". He also used it in his story \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe liked Goethe's work and was probably influenced by it. This is clear in his poem \"Dream-Land\".\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe respected. Poe liked another writer, Tennyson, and Tennyson liked Goethe. Poe would have known Goethe's work because of Tennyson. Poe also saw many copies of Goethe's work after it was first published.",
            "California law says a customer who was hurt after slipping and falling on applesauce in a grocery store may be able to get extra money from the store. This is because the store manager did not clean up the spill for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner at the time.\n\nA court is not likely to throw out the customer's claim for extra money. The customer must prove that the store manager acted with bad intentions. She must show that he was aware that not cleaning up the spill could hurt someone and still chose to do nothing. \n\nThe customer has evidence that the manager knew the spill was a danger. Several people had slipped and fallen in the store many times before she fell. The manager even knew about the previous accidents, but he still did not clean up the spill.\n\nThe customer will argue that the manager's actions were very bad. He was not just careless, but he showed a bad intention to ignore the danger. The customer will say that the manager's actions were bad because he knew about the danger and still did nothing to fix it.\n\nIn the past, six people had slipped and fallen in the store in one year. The manager still did not take care to keep the store safe. This will be a big part of the customer's argument.\n\nThe store manager was informed about the spill two times. The first time, he said he was on a break and did not have time to deal with it. The second time, he said the same thing. Thirty minutes later, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back.\n\nTo get extra money, the customer must prove that the store manager acted with bad intentions. The law in California says a person can get extra money from another person if they acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means acting with the intention to cause harm, or not intending to cause harm, but acting very badly and showing a disregard for other people's safety.\n\nA court has said that a person acts with malice when they know that their actions could cause harm, but they still choose to do nothing to stop it. In this case, the store manager knew that not cleaning up the spill could hurt someone, but he still did nothing. This will be a big part of the customer's argument.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC four years ago.  The main topic of our class discussions was whether Islam is a violent religion.  I think the question is more important now than ever.  After 9/11, I saw how the media changed its view of Islam.  Now, we see a lot of acceptance of Islam in America.  In 2001, I don't think we would have voted for a president like Barack Obama, who has a Muslim family background.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  It does not fit with what I thought I knew about him.  I thought he forced people to join Islam.  But the biography says he was a humble man who was misunderstood.  People came to believe in him because they saw the truth in his words.  \n\nThere are some similar things between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad took little food and made a lot for many people to eat.  The story of Muhammad makes me think that the writers wanted to show him as a humble man.  But this makes me think they are taking away from the life and miracles of Jesus.  It is like they are taking credit for Jesus' life.\n\nThe stories in the biography are often from other people's perspectives.  This makes me question the stories.  I don't like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nI don't like how the biography tries to show Muhammad as a good man.  I know from history that he did not act like a kind and humble man.  I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's teachings and beliefs moved away from their origin after Jesus' death.  We see this happening in history.  Christianity is moving farther from its original beliefs.  Many people still follow traditional ideas.  But more people are becoming aware and want to know more about the origin of their religion.  They want to know the true meaning of Jesus' teachings.\n\nThis movement will continue to grow.  People will want to separate the teachings of Jesus from the ideas that were added later.  It may take many years, but this is what will happen.  The true meaning of Christianity will come back to life.  People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus.  This will be a big change.  The church will stay strong, but the way people believe and live will become more alike.\n\nLook at history.  Many things have changed over time.  Once, Christians were treated badly by the Roman Empire.  But later, the empire became Christian.  Our country has changed, too.  Slavery was once a part of our country.  Now, African-Americans are leaders in our country.  This change will happen in the Christian church.\n\nTo make this change, people will learn to see Jesus' words as metaphors, not as rules.  So, what happened after Jesus' death?\n\nThe Jewish people were the first to believe in one God.  They were a special group of people.  They had different groups, like the Sadducees and Pharisees.

            "I think The Jungle shows that people are often selfish and only think of themselves. They want to make their own lives better, but they do not care about others. The book shows this in many ways. The factory owners and managers are a good example. They just want to make their companies bigger and more successful. They do not care about people or animals that might be hurt by their actions. The owner of the factory in the book wants to make money, no matter what. He does not care about the pollution from his factory or the bad conditions where the animals live.\n\nThe owners and managers also do not treat their workers well. They work the workers very hard and do not give them fair pay or good working conditions. They just want to make more money. If the workers get hurt or sick, the owners do not care. They can just let them go without giving them any help.\n\nThe workers in the book are very unhappy. They are treated like slaves. They have to work very hard and do not have any protection. They are poor and do not have much power. The owners and managers are very powerful and do not care about the workers. This makes the workers very angry and unhappy.\n\nThe Jungle shows that some people are very selfish and do not care about others. They just want to make money and get ahead. This is a bad way to live and can cause a lot of problems.",
            "Many authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. Some ways are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these ways in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs an adjective and a noun that do not usually fit together to make readers think of a certain idea. Other times, he gives a special meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose.\n\nFitzgerald uses this last way with many colors, including gold, green, white, and red. In his novel The Great Gatsby, he makes special meanings for colors, such as white and red. He uses these meanings to make readers remember a certain feeling about an important object.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald makes for white is uniformity. White is a bit better and more important. Gray is more old and not as good. He shows this meaning at the beginning of the novel. Everyone is always wearing white: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white flannels, Tom wears a white shirt, and Catherine is very white.\n\nFitzgerald also gives a special meaning to gray. He makes gray mean old and not as good. In fact, the only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his first impression of Gatsby's party. Fitzgerald also uses these colors for common, unimportant things: Nick goes down white streets in lower New York, gray names are on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is a gray apartment-house.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald makes these meanings clear, he uses them to show that something is not important. He starts with Daisy. He does not use these colors for a long time, and then he describes Daisy as wearing white. Readers begin to see Daisy as not a special person, but just something Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique around Daisy to show that she is not special.\n\nHe also uses this technique with Tom and Gatsby. Tom and Gatsby are wearing gray clothes, and readers start to see them as old and not important. Fitzgerald makes readers see that these people are not special.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show readers that some people are not important. He shows that some people are just trying to be something they are not. He uses these colors to show readers that some people are just like everyone else.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The climate is mild and sunny. Many kinds of crops grow well there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. People want to buy food from local farms. Many farmers in San Diego grow food without using chemicals. They call this organic farming.\n\nThese farmers sell their food to people who want to eat healthy food. Some farmers also give tours of their farms. People can walk or hike on the farms. They can see birds and other animals. This can be a good way for farmers to make money.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This makes it easier for plants and animals to live there. But organic farming is not always easy. It needs more work to keep pests and weeds out and to make the soil healthy. It also costs more money than farming with chemicals.\n\nThe land chosen for this example is in San Diego County. It is next to a small town. The land is 160 acres. It is covered with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. Many kinds of plants and animals live there. Some are endangered. They include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. They were Native Americans, then cattle ranchers and wood sellers. The land was used for grazing and making wood for many years.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a website and looked at government programs that can help farmers.

            "Culture is an important part of any negotiation. Culture can be defined in many ways. It is not one thing, and it can be different for different people. We should not make broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too general and not true for every person. \n\nWhen we learn about a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. This helps us understand it better. To learn about a foreign culture, we can study its history, its values, and its way of thinking. We must accept a culture for what it is and work within its rules, especially when we are in a weaker position in a negotiation.\n\nA culture is not just about a country. Companies also have their own culture. For example, some companies value long work hours while others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they work together. Even within the same country, different companies can have different cultures.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They explain why people make decisions. If saving face is important in a culture, a negotiator will not publicly disagree with others. If making a good deal is important, a negotiator will not settle quickly. Knowing these things can help a negotiator be more successful.\n\nBefore a negotiation, it is helpful to learn about the other person's culture and values. This way, we can be more effective in our negotiations.",
            "A famous Bible verse says, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is also found in the writings of two famous thinkers, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. They both believe in the existence of God, but they use different methods to explain why. To compare their ideas, we will assume they are talking about the God of the Bible. \n\nTo understand their arguments, we need to look at each of their ideas. St. Anselm's argument is based on faith. He says that because we can imagine God, it is impossible for him not to exist. Anselm thinks we can find proof of God by looking inside ourselves. He believes the truth about God is already inside our minds, so we do not need external proof. This idea is often called faith in Christian teachings.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks the existence of God can be proven by using reason and evidence. He does not need faith to make his argument. Aquinas gives five reasons for believing in God. He says that change, cause, contingency, order, and harmony all need a higher power, God, to explain them. We can understand the existence of God by using logic.\n\nIn short, St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas have different ways of understanding God. Anselm uses faith, while Aquinas uses reason and evidence.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. This prince would one day be called Buddha. Over his life, he gave up his position in the world and became very wise. He taught people, and his teachings led to the creation of a big group called Buddhism. This group is about twenty-five hundred years old. It looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. You can see this in the country of Sri Lanka. There, a special ceremony is held every year. Many people, including monks and regular people, take part in this ceremony. It has some religious importance, but it is not mentioned in Buddha's teachings.\n\nThe group of people who practice Theravada Buddhism has changed over time. This change is from the small things to the most important parts of the religion. The Theravada community has had to change its ideas over time. This happened because of forces both inside and outside the group. Sometimes these forces were good, and sometimes they were bad.\n\nThere are some important words we will use often in this discussion. When we talk about a force inside the Buddhist group, it means a force from someone who follows the Buddha's teachings. A force from someone who is not a Buddhist is outside the group. A bad force is something that hurts or wants to hurt the Buddhist group. A good force is something that does not want to hurt or help the group, but may do one of these things by accident.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basics of Buddhism. The most important ideas in Buddhism are the Triple Gem. The Triple Gem is the Buddha, the teachings, and the group of monks. The teachings are made up of three groups of text. One group has all the teachings of the Buddha. Another group has rules for living. The third group has ideas about the world and how it works. Some of these ideas are that there is no soul, life is suffering, and everything is changing.\n\nBy understanding these ideas, people can stop the never-ending cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. When people become wise, they will also stop desire, hatred, and delusion. The rules for living in Buddhism are found in the group of text that has rules. For people who are not monks, there are five rules. For monks, there are more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped.",

In 1917, biologist D'Arcy Thompson said it is hard to describe the shape of living things in simple language. Even today, it is still difficult. Recently, math has been used to study how animals grow their skeletons. Our study uses math and experiments to understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe looked at how shells grow in a type of sea snail called Prunum. We took pictures of the shells using X-rays. We then used these pictures to create math models of the shells. These models help us understand how the shells can change. We want to know how living things change over millions of years.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows as the animal moves through time. It grows in a circle, or spiral, around a center point. This center point is called the columella. The shell grows by adding new layers, or whorls. Each whorl is connected to the next by a line called a suture. The last whorl is the biggest one. The top of the shell is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways. We can look at the top, bottom, or the hole. We can also look at the edge of the shell. When we look at a shell, we can count the number of whorls. We start by looking at the top and finding where the first line is. Then we draw a line and count the whorls from there.\n\nA shell is like a series of holes that move through time as the animal grows. We can trace the path of the hole by looking at the center of each whorl. We can also look at the size of the hole. This helps us understand how the shell grows. We can use math to describe how the shell grows and change the math to see how the shell can change.",
            "Indonesia has not seen much change in the number of babies and small children who die in their first year.  The country is doing well in some areas, such as making clean water and toilets available.  But Indonesia is not making progress in keeping babies and mothers healthy.  The country has a long way to go to meet its goals by 2015.\n\nIn Indonesia, 72% of babies are born with a skilled health worker present.  But this number is not as good as it seems.  Some of these workers are midwives who cannot help if the mother has a problem during delivery.  This means many mothers die from heavy bleeding during childbirth.  The country must do more work in this area.\n\nThere are also problems with providing care for children who have diarrhea.  Few of these children see a health worker.  We do not have good information about taking care of new mothers after they have a baby.  But it is clear that this is a problem.\n\nMost women do not have surgery to help them deliver their babies.  Only 4% of women have a cesarean section.  This is too low.  In cities, 7% of women have a cesarean section.  But in rural areas, only 2% do.  This means that women in rural areas do not have access to good healthcare.  The country is not doing a good job of providing healthcare to people who need it most.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is that not everyone can get the healthcare they need.  People who are poor have a hard time getting care.  They may not have the money to pay for it.  There is a big difference in who gets care and who does not.  The rich get more care than the poor.\n\nTo improve the health of mothers and babies, the country must think about how to get more people healthcare.  Should the country focus on solving one problem at a time, or should it try to make the overall healthcare system better?  One way to solve a problem quickly is to focus on one area.  But this can be a problem if other areas do not get enough money or help.  This can cause problems and make things worse.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their details and stories about the rich people of that time. Two novels that are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting and help us understand their feelings and reasons for acting a certain way.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen often. These events give us information about Oliver's inner life. They show us what hurts him and what he thinks about the world around him.\n\nOne example is when Oliver is shot. In chapter 28, he relives the event in his mind. It is like a dream. He is trying to find help. Oliver is very sad and stressed because of the shooting. He does not have control over what happens to him.\n\nThe passage above shows that Oliver has little control over his life. He cannot even try to control the things that happen to him. This makes us think that Oliver feels defeated. It seems that the bad people in the story, like Fagin, are making Oliver give up. Oliver should try to save himself, but he does not.\n\nAnother example of a strange event is from Wuthering Heights. The author writes: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"\n\nIn this passage, the author is describing a long and scary night. The day and night seem to be mixed up. This creates a feeling of uncertainty and fear. The author is trying to show us how the characters feel in this situation.\n\nThese two novels use strange events to make their stories more interesting and to help us understand the characters better. They are different from other Victorian novels because they use mystery and strange events to create a more emotional and exciting story.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped children with their school work. I was good at helping them with English and reading. I worked with a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. He had trouble reading. I tried to help him, but it was hard. Some words he could read, but others he could not.\n\nI thought something was strange. He spoke perfect English, but he had trouble reading. He was from a Latino family. One day, his mother came to the program. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. I tried to talk to her, but I knew very little Spanish. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to talk about a big problem in schools. It is the language barrier. I think this problem exists everywhere, even in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading can still be hard. So, what can we do to help?\n\nIn Adrian's case, the answer was simple. He needed help with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one answer. We need to try many things. This includes the dual language system, where children learn two languages. This is a good idea. Children in this program do better in school.\n\nSome people are afraid to try the dual language system. They think it is not worth it. But this is not true. If we do this in all schools, all children will benefit. So, how do we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers, like tutors, who are bilingual.",
            "Most people are told as children that there is something big and powerful in the world. This something is often called God. Some people learn about God in Sunday school. Others learn about it in their own homes or in their own minds. Many people accept the ideas about God that their parents teach them. But some people do not believe in God. They think that there is no power beyond what we can see and understand.\n\nWe all try to learn about the world around us. We try to learn about ourselves, too. We find our own ways to believe in things that are bigger than we are. We try to find guidance in the dark times so that we can find peace and happiness.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so when I asked him about his favorite birds. We sat on our porch during a heavy rain. The sound of the rain on the roof was loud. We were smoking cigarettes and trying to talk.\n\nMy father looked out into the rain. He was thinking about something far away. He was sick and looked weak. He didn't want to talk about how sick he was. I was sad and afraid. I didn't want to think about losing him. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out into the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December, five days after my birthday. He had cancer. The doctors tried to make him better, but they couldn't. I didn't want to see him die. I didn't want to watch the life that made me end. I wanted to remember my father for the good times, not the bad.\n\nI didn't visit him when he was dying. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting to hear the news. No one called me to tell me that he had died.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a strange mix of old and new. Ian Watt describes it as an oxymoron, or a mix of words that are opposite. The Gothic style has been attacked and praised, accused of not being deep, and praised for its strong and powerful emotions.\n\nThe first Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's Castle of Otranto, took ideas from old and new stories. It mixed the excitement of old theatrical shows with the modern idea of a novel. Walpole used this mix to create a new way of writing.\n\nThe Gothic style uses things from the past, like medieval theater and buildings. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the word \"Gothic\" was used to describe many things. It seemed old-fashioned compared to the new ideas in society and literature.\n\nThe mix of old and new ideas makes the Gothic style last a long time. It becomes old and new at the same time for readers.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a way of training a knight to be brave, honest, and strong. In the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, chivalry is important because it shows what a good knight should be. The writer, Horace Walpole, was unhappy with the state of society and saw the Gothic era as a time when people were more moral.\n\nIn his writing, Walpole shows a character named Frederic who has many chivalric qualities. He is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be dead. The reader can see that he is a kind and gentle man who is very brave.\n\nThe character of Frederic is an example of the Gothic trope of excess, or things being too exaggerated. This is a common idea in Gothic stories.",
            "Supply Chain Management\n\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the raw materials, then to production, supply, and distribution to the customer. This process was first used in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver.\n\nThere are six important parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These parts work together to give the best service to customers.\n\nThe first part is production. This is the start of the supply chain process. Production is the foundation of the supply chain. It tells us when, why, where, and how products are made. To know what to make, managers look at the market. The market shows what customers want.\n\nAfter looking at the market, managers decide how many products to make and what products to make. They also decide where to make the products. This decision is based on the customer's demand and satisfaction. Next, managers plan the work and keep the equipment in good condition.\n\nProduction is a very important part of the supply chain. If one step is not planned, it can cost the company a lot of time and money. For example, a big company like Wal-Mart has a plan for everything, from an employee's uniform to receiving shipments. This plan helps the company work smoothly and on the right track.\n\nThe second part of the supply chain is supply. Supply is about making decisions that help a company find the right partners and equipment. A company may have different parts of production for one product. The manager must decide which part is best for the job. Sometimes, companies also work with other companies to make things. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps a company be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "A message says Hitler is alive in Burma. Ellen Page, star of the movie Juno, holds a sign on a street corner. The sign says Burma, also known as Myanmar. This country is in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strong group of military leaders who took power in 1962. In 2007, many people protested in the streets. They were led by Buddhist monks. This event is called the Saffron Revolution. The monks wore red robes. The government at first let the monks gather, but then it became very violent. The military attacked the monasteries and arrested journalists. One journalist was killed in 2007. The government said 13 people died, but a military member who defected said many more died.\n\nThis is not new. Governments have tried to stop people from speaking out for a long time. The Roman leaders thought they were chosen by the gods. The Japanese emperor was believed to be a god. Some people think the current president of the United States has a special connection with a man who leads a group that wants to control the country.\n\nThere have been many bad examples of this. One example is the protest in China in 1989. Students, workers and intellectuals protested against the government. The death toll is not known exactly. The government said 200-300 people died, but others said many more died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their ethnic group. In World War II, many Jewish people were killed because of their religion.",
            "Duke Ellington's importance in jazz comes from his long life and creative abilities. He could shape his orchestra and make many great music pieces. Ellington often played the piano in his compositions, but as a composer, he made rich and complex music that showed the talents of each band member. He created a plan for the band to play very well together. He also wrote music with a special style for each band member. This made the orchestra sound good and original. Ellington knew how each player sounded and how they worked well together. He wrote some of the most great music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington's music was special. He used the human voice like a musical instrument. This was new and different. He did this in a song called Creole Love Call. In this song, Ellington added texture and color without using words. He knew how to make his soloists sound good. This is true for his whole career. Creole Love Call is a slow blues song with six parts. \n\nPart 1: The singer and the woodwind instruments talk to each other. The singer starts with a smooth sound and ends with a rough sound.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a solo and makes the melody sound more interesting.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and high sound. The piano plays a special rhythm.\nPart 4: The whole band does what the singer and the woodwind instruments did in the first part.\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start talking and the brass and rhythm instruments play a special rhythm.\nPart 6: This part is like the first part. The singer sounds like a special instrument. \n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill to make the band sound tight. He also uses his ear to make the music sound good. In this song, the trumpet player and the singer work together to make a special sound. Another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), is also great. Ellington uses the trombone player to make the melody sound good. \n\nEllington's use of voice in music is an example of how he made his music special.",
            "She had always felt like something was missing. This feeling would not go away. It started when she was about 14 years old. Three years later, at 17, she still felt this way. By now, she had decided she wanted someone, not just something. But she was not interested in any boys. Some boys had tried to be friends with her, but none of them interested her. She often asked herself why she felt this way.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful. Her parents were kind and calm people. They rarely argued with each other. When they argued with her, it was usually about her strong personality. She was a calm person's daughter, but she was not calm. Her personality was fun and lively.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She walked from room to room, looking for something new. She heard a loud noise from the kitchen. Her mother was on the ground, hurting. The daughter ran to her side and asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother said, \"Ow... take me to the hospital.\" The daughter helped her mother to the car and drove her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a sad place. There were bad smells and people who were sick. But she was not feeling sad. She was worried about her mother. She helped her mother to a bed and called for the doctors. The doctors looked at her mother and took her to be treated. The daughter waited for news.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stool while trying to get a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study was done to see if eating a \"Mediterranean Diet\" can help prevent chronic heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean Diet is a special kind of diet that is high in plant foods and lower in animal products.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that people who eat a Mediterranean Diet are less likely to die from heart disease and other cardiovascular problems. But these studies did not look at stroke separately.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women who were part of a group of 121,700 nurses. The women were between 38 and 63 years old and did not have any heart disease or diabetes. They answered a food questionnaire six times between 1984 and 2004. They reported how often they ate certain foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and fish. They also reported how much animal products and saturated fats they ate.\n\nThe researchers looked at how often the women had heart disease or stroke over a 20-year period. They also looked at how often they exercised and other health factors.\n\nThe results showed that women who ate more of a Mediterranean Diet were less likely to get heart disease or stroke. They also found that these women were less likely to die from heart disease or stroke.\n\nThe researchers found that women who ate the most Mediterranean Diet food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They compared the risk of these women to women who ate the least Mediterranean Diet food. The women who ate more Mediterranean Diet food had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThis study suggests that eating a Mediterranean Diet can help prevent heart disease and stroke. It is a healthy diet that is high in plant foods and low in animal products.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and big companies had big problems. We need to know why this happened and how to stop it. The financial crisis was caused by bad and foolish actions by politicians. They made banks and companies give loans to people who could not pay them back. This happened in a country with a weak financial system. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped to buy and sell these bad loans. When people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold the bad loans to others and this caused problems in the whole economy.\n\nThis problem started a long time ago, in 1999. The President wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular. So, he made it easier for people to get loans. This made the housing market look good for a while. But it was not good for the future. A reporter, Steven Holmes, wrote in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae is under pressure to give loans to people who cannot pay.\" He said that this could cause problems in the future. And it did.\n\nMany things helped to make the economy worse. New kinds of loans were created, like adjustable-rate mortgages. These loans were like a trap for people. They could not pay them back, and the banks lost a lot of money. The housing market was like a big balloon. It looked good, but it was going to burst. And it did. The top five big investment banks in the US had $4.1 trillion dollars in debt in 2007. This was 30% of the country's money. Some banks, like Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers, had big problems. They were sold cheap. Other banks had to change and become more careful.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac had $5 trillion dollars in debt. They were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Exposition: A Warning for Writers\n\nExposition is a problem for many writers. It is the part of a story where you tell the reader too much. You might think you are helping the reader, but you are not. You are making them bored.\n\nA good writer knows the rule \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes it is hard to follow. Dr. Merlin, a writer, knows what she is talking about. She says exposition can be like a devil on your shoulder, telling you to get the background information out of the way.\n\nIn writing, exposition is when you tell the reader what happened. It is like a character telling another character a lot of information. In a movie, it is when one actor talks to another about something that happened before the story started.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine a story where a woman's husband dies in front of her. You wouldn't want to read a whole page about it. You would want to see how the husband and wife were together and how much they loved each other. You would want to see how the woman felt when her husband died.\n\nA good writer will give you more information about the characters. They will show you how the husband loved his wife and how it changed her life. This way, you will feel sad when he dies and you will feel connected to the woman.\n\nAs a writer, you need to give your readers more than just the basics. You need to make them feel something. Don't rush through the parts of your story that are important. Take your time and make it real.",
            "I watched two news reports on TV from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was from NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man who hurt his wife in Ashley, Ohio. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. They spent a short time on this story. They said he hurt his wife several times and was arrested. I think they gave it enough time.\nThe next story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was badly hurt. No one was arrested yet. The police were working hard to find the person who did it. This story was short, and I think it was because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed this before - when a black person is a victim of a crime, it gets less attention. If a white person is a victim, the media talks about it a lot.\nThe next story was about a helicopter that was shot. They said it was a small bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. The police are offering a reward to find the person who did it.\nThe weather report said it would rain on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be hot, around 80 degrees.\nThey also talked about a store that was robbed on Clime Road. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. They said he was tall and thin. They spent a lot of time saying he was black and how dark he was.\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was caught and sentenced to 25 years in prison. I do not think it was necessary to say he was Hispanic.",
            "Brothers have a special bond. This bond is strong and forever. It has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and anger. These are just a few examples. Brothers understand each other better than people with other kinds of relationships. They see themselves in each other. When difficult situations happen, the true nature of this bond appears. It can be good or bad.\n\nWhen brothers feel these emotions, they come with a price. Understanding these feelings and their results is important. When a brother looks at another brother, he sees himself. He sees himself, not as others see him, but as he really is. His actions and their results show what kind of person he is.\n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers experience this brotherly bond. They go on a difficult journey. Pride and disappointment mix together in a strong way. Only one brother survives.\n\nThe story shows the true nature of the brothers through their actions and their feelings. The narrator helps us understand the brothers' complex emotions and their view of the world. This helps us understand their actions.\n\nOne brother's main feeling is pride. From the beginning, he feels unhappy with his little brother, Doodle. He wants a brother who can do things like run and climb. But Doodle is sick and cannot do these things. This makes the brother very sad and angry. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiles, he feels happy and wants to protect him. This shows that the brother loves his little brother.",
            "The human brain is a complicated system that processes information. As technology has improved, people have used different comparisons to describe the brain. At first, it was like a piece of wax that you could write on. Then it was compared to a piece of paper, and more recently to a computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons are not complete and can lead to wrong ideas.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses, such as our eyes, ears, and skin. This information is changed into signals that the brain can understand. The brain does this many times as it processes the information. For example, when you look at a black box on a white background, the brain puts together small pieces of information, like color and shape, to decide that you are seeing a box.\n\nThe brain also uses the information from earlier steps to help you understand the information faster. This is called top-down processing. So, in the example, the brain uses the information it already knows to decide that you are seeing a black box, not a hole in the background.\n\nThe brain then decides which information is important and which processes to use it for. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain processes every blade of grass, but it does not show them to you. You might, however, hear your name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information so that it can use it later. There are three kinds of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. First, the brain must put the information into a form that it can use. For example, words can be stored in different ways, such as what the word looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means.\n\nOnce the information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies with animals suggest that working memory is kept by a signal that goes through a group of brain cells for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the shape of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to imagine how the brain stores knowledge. Some ideas come from how people remember things, while others come from computer science and brain studies. One idea is that the brain has nodes that represent ideas, and the nodes are connected based on how they are related. For example, in this idea, the word \"chair\" is connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley is critical of the growing threat of technology and the capitalist system that supports it. He writes about this in his novel, Brave New World. In this world, people value their community above their individual freedom. They are taught to seek happiness above all else from a young age. The citizens are seen as pawns in a bigger game, controlled by the World Controller. By looking at the book through the ideas of Marxist thought, we can see that Huxley is concerned about the dangers of these systems.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism in his book. He uses ideas from Marxism to show how people are not aware of their true place in society. This is called false consciousness. The common people are not interested in understanding the relationship between different classes in society. They are interested in getting ahead and being happy. This is made easier by the World Controller, who controls what people think and do.\n\nThe different classes in Brave New World, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own ideas or desires. They are controlled by the World Controller. He uses hypnosis to make them want to buy and consume things. This is an example of a system where one group of people controls others. This is called hegemony. The lower classes do not even know they are being controlled. The upper classes know but do nothing to change it.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have real relationships with each other. They do not have deep emotions or connections. The characters in the book are not well-developed. This may be Huxley's way of showing that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and emotions. In the book, people do not feel love or strong emotions. They just have superficial relationships.\n\nThe way people accept their place in society shows the effects of capitalism. They are happy to be part of the system and do not question it. This is like the Marxist idea of the proletariat, who are happy to be part of the system as long as they can consume and be happy.",
            "I have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year, I was in an East Halls dorm room. It is far from many classes. I had to walk a long time to get to class. Sometimes it took twenty-five minutes to walk from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building. The weather was often bad in State College.\n\nI talked to an older student. They told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were far from the rest of the school. Now, they are surrounded by new buildings and sports fields. The campus is getting bigger. It is harder to get around. What is the best way to solve this problem? I think the answer is the bicycle. But biking alone is not enough. We need to bike and the campus needs to be built for bikers.\n\nMy friend started biking again. He said, \"Bikes are great.\" He said it's the best way to get around. Biking is good for your body. It's the most efficient way to travel. You can go thirty miles with a little food and exercise. I live off campus. I have class in Thomas building. It's a twenty-five minute walk. But I can bike there in five minutes if I go fast. The problem is, Pollock Road is not easy to bike on. There are things to say for walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking would take extra time. I don't have time to walk."
