            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

These values are important for all social workers, and they are also important to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I did not know what job I wanted to do. While I was in high school and college, I saw many people ignoring their problems. Some people used bad ways to deal with their problems. Because of what I saw, I decided to study psychology. I still did not know what job I wanted, so I took a break after I finished college. One summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was very nervous. He was there because his parents were being mean to him. I called the police and told them I had studied psychology in college. They asked me to talk to the parents. When I asked them about the boy, they seemed nervous and made excuses. After that, I decided to study social work to help children like the boy.\n\nAnother important value is fairness. We say that every person is important, but we do not always act that way. We say we value individuality, but we often do what others do. I do not like to do what others do. I like to be myself.

            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model focuses on genetic information and medical health issues. The Sociocultural model looks at how environment and social factors affect sleep. This review will examine research on these models and explain each study. We will look at the strengths and weaknesses of each study to better understand the models.\n\nThere are different types of sleep disorders. Some are primary sleep disorders. Others are related to mental or medical problems. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to a mental disorder are linked to a major mental illness. Other sleep disorders are caused by medical problems or a person's behavior.\n\nDyssonmias are sleep disorders that affect how we sleep. Some Dyssonmias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia is a problem with sleeping too little. Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with sleeping too much. Narcolepsy causes people to fall asleep suddenly. Dyssonmias are about falling asleep and staying asleep.\n\nParasomnias are sleep disorders that cause behavioral problems or physical reactions. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to a mental illness are linked to an Axis I (serious mental illness) or Axis II (personality disorder or mental disability) disorder.\n\nThis review will focus on insomnia and primary sleep disorders. It will look at the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetic factors, hereditary traits, and physical aspects of sleep. A study on mice found that neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin control sleep and wakefulness. The study found that mice with a specific receptor on these neurons had problems with sleep and wake states. Researchers found that a chemical (baclofen) that activated the receptor helped mice sleep. This study suggests that there may be a genetic and environmental basis for sleep problems in humans. This could affect a person's ability to sleep without medicine.\n\nThe Sociocultural implication of this study is that if the receptor is inherited, it could affect a person's sleep. This could impact daily life, such as school, work, or other tasks that require concentration.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we explain what the disorder is. Next, we explain how to diagnose it. Finally, we talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem where the brain does not work correctly with sounds. People with CAPD can hear normally. They do not have a hearing problem. But their brain cannot separate sounds or understand speech in noisy places. This is not the same as being deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThe study of CAPD began in the 1950s. Researchers were trying to understand children with speech and hearing problems. They made tests to help them. A doctor named Kimura created a way to test how the brain works with sounds in the 1960s.\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble hearing where sounds come from. They may have trouble telling two sounds apart. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may have trouble understanding speech. They may not be able to hear one sound because of another sound. They may not be able to understand what sounds mean.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a doctor must test the person with CAPD. The doctor may use questionnaires, observe how the person behaves, or use special tests. These tests can check how the person hears and responds to sounds. There is no one test that works for everyone. But doctors use many different tests to try to understand what is happening.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom. First, the teacher should sit near the student. This way, the student can see the teacher's face and hear them more easily. The teacher should also avoid background noise. This can make it harder for the student to hear. The teacher should speak clearly and loudly, but not too loudly. The teacher should also give the student extra time to answer questions. This can help the student understand what is being said.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that using a disguise can help people trick others. But, it can also cause problems. If a person stays in disguise too long, they may lose their true self. Ending a deception can be hard because it may hurt relationships.\n\nThe play is especially interesting when it talks about people changing their gender. This raises many questions. Why do people want to disguise themselves as the opposite sex? In the play, a character named Viola wants to change her sex to protect herself. She is a woman who is alone in a new place. She decides to pretend to be a man so she can be safe.\n\nViola's plan works. But it also separates her from other women. She is good at acting like a man that others start to think she is really a man. Another character, Olivia, falls in love with Viola but does not know she is a woman. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino but is pretending to be a man so she cannot be honest about her feelings.\n\nThe play may show that people can use a disguise to discover hidden feelings. Two characters, Olivia and Orsino, may have feelings for each other that they do not express openly. When Viola appears as a man, they are forced to think about their feelings. But, it is not clear if Olivia really likes Viola or just likes the way Viola looks. The play may be saying that people make judgments based on how others look.\n\nThis is shown when Olivia quickly switches her love from Viola to Viola's twin brother, Sebastian. She starts to see Viola as a sister rather than a love interest. The play is saying that people may not be honest about their feelings and may judge others based on how they look.",
            "German rule in Africa was very bad. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. But German rule was not the same everywhere. Each colony had its own ideas and ways of doing things. Schools in the colonies were also different. When the British took control of German East Africa (now known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. Germans had also built good schools in Kamerun and other colonies.\n\nBut the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was different. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach the local people. In South West Africa, the government left most of the teaching to missionaries. The government did give some money to the missionaries, but not enough. The government, however, built many schools for Europeans living in the colony. They also controlled and supported the schools run by missionaries. This policy had a big effect on South West Africa even after German rule ended. Many Africans in South West Africa did not learn to read and write.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated and literate Africans. But in South West Africa, “most of the people were not educated, not literate.” Many things caused this difference. This paper wants to discuss these things and look at how the people who ruled the colony and the settlers felt about the local people.\n\nThere is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of these writings describe the schools in the colonies. Later writings compared the schools in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. These studies showed that the schools in each colony were different. One important study was done by Cohen. He compared the schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the large number of settlers in South West Africa helped create the differences in the education system there.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of it was desert. The number of European settlers in the colony was small compared to the population of East Africa. By 1913, about 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 Europeans lived in East Africa.",
            "The music called Popular Music has grown over the past 100 years. It has many kinds. It is hard to list them all. Many kinds of music have smaller kinds. For example, the kind called Heavy Metal rock has many smaller kinds. Heavy Metal rock is expressive. It shows a wide range of feelings. It is mostly on the darker side. \n\nHeavy Metal rock is also very diverse. Many people started to make their own smaller kinds of Heavy Metal rock. This continued for many years. Today, there are many kinds of Heavy Metal music. It is hard to say what exactly Heavy Metal is. It has taken parts from other kinds of music. But it started from somewhere. To understand the kind of music we have today, we need to know what Heavy Metal is and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy Metal is a movement that is often about things that are dark. It is often loud and violent. It can be very theatrical. People who make Heavy Metal music are very good at their instruments. Heavy Metal music often comes from using strong drugs. There was a time when many people were using strong drugs. This led to music that was very strange and new. Many later kinds of Heavy Metal music took parts from the dark and exciting qualities of old music. Some songs, like Helter Skelter, show the darker side of music. This song is from the Beatles. It is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made because the Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous artist. He painted many pictures. One of his most famous works is called The Dream. It was painted in 1910.\n\nThe Dream is more than just a picture of a woman in a dream. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be a great artist. He wanted people to like his work.\n\nRousseau had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by other artists. But he also wanted to be his own person. He wanted to paint in his own way, not like others. This made him very unhappy.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in a small town in France. His father was a worker. Rousseau had no special training in art. He worked as a toll collector. At home, he had a daughter and a lot of grief. He started painting to make himself happy.\n\nRousseau wanted to be like other artists. He saw them painting beautiful pictures. He wanted to be good too. But Rousseau's paintings were different. He painted simple things, like the world around him. He was a folk painter.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous. He wanted people to like his art. But it was hard. Many other artists were famous. They had been painting for a long time. Rousseau was older when he started. He didn't get famous until later.\n\nA man named Jan Gordon wrote about Rousseau and another artist named Matisse. Matisse was a good painter. He didn't want to paint like others. He wanted to be different. Rousseau wanted to be like everyone else. He wanted to be accepted.\n\nRousseau's story is an example of a person who wanted to be accepted by others. But he also wanted to be himself. It's a big problem to solve.",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested a strong connection between ethics and beauty. They believe that at a basic level, there is a reason for this connection. John Keats wrote in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to like ethics and beauty without being taught these things in school. Both ethics and beauty are attempts to describe, not tell us what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are attempts to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right, rather than a set of rules.\n\nIn fact, we cannot fully understand what is good or beautiful by just talking about it. For example, a conversation about the Mona Lisa by da Vinci may talk about its background, foreground, and contrast. But these things do not explain why it is a good piece of art. When we like a work of art or literature, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think both art and morals cannot be fully explained. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how much we describe a work of literature, there is something more.\n\nI think ethics and art are similar because we experience both most strongly in a way that cannot be fully explained. This is true, especially for literature. As McKean said, \"Literature has a moral quality that is unique. It is connected to our values in life.\" We need values to live. Literature is important because it gives us values.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture that comes from many different groups and tribes. The culture can be seen in many parts of the country, from the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It can also be seen in Köln on the Rhine River, in the center of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany's culture is special because it has a long history. Many different groups lived in the area that is now Germany. The country's name, Germania, comes from the Germanic tribes. But where the name came from is not clear. Some historians think it came from a tribe known as the Tungrians. They were a group of people who lived in the area before they moved across the Rhine River and fought with the Gauls.\n\nJulius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the people he was fighting against. Caesar learned the word from the Gauls themselves. They used it to describe their neighbors. Caesar used the word to show the difference between the Gauls and the Germans.\n\nThe origin of the word \"German\" is not clear. Some people think it came from the spear that the Germanic tribes used in battle. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This might mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said that the Germans were a separate group of people who did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild and cold country, and they were not interested in leaving their homes to go to other places.\n\nFor a long time, the Romans did not conquer Germany. They did not want to live there. Instead, they would send soldiers to the area to get goods and to trade with the Germanic tribes. The Germanic tribes would often serve in the Roman army, and they would bring their skills back to their own homes.",
            "I stared down at the bowl in front of me. My mind was empty. I was not thinking about the picture in front of me. I was just looking at it.\n\nWhen I was a child, I wanted to learn how to draw. I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches how to understand art. One way it teaches is to use a square frame around a picture. This helps you see the picture clearly.\n\nBut at that moment, I could not think about a frame. The bowl was too busy and complicated. I was amazed by it.\n\nI wanted to be an artist. Picasso liked blue, Monet liked green, and the Renaissance masters liked many colors. I thought the bowl could be my painting, my story, called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI picked up my pencil. My hand moved, and my mind made something new. Water was flowing, and things were moving away. But then my hand hit the toilet handle again. The brown package would not move. It was stuck.\n\nI was unhappy. I had a mop in my hand and a green tie around my neck. I looked at the dirty package and thought about the people who clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. I wanted to make it go away.\n\nI flushed the toilet again. Then I used toilet paper to fix my hand. I bent down to get the package. My hand went into the water like a mother cooking a turkey.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Several things make this a big problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers also do not have much experience. This lack of experience causes more accidents and makes them drive too fast or drive off the road.\n\nTeenagers also drive badly when they have friends in the car. A study in California found that when the young passenger is older, there are more car accidents.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teens by requiring temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and say they cannot have other young people in the car.\n\nBut some people think that is not enough. They say teens are not ready to drive safely. A psychologist says that even 18 is too young to drive. He says young people like to take risks for fun. This means we should wait until they are older before they can drive. If we let young teens drive, many more people will be hurt or killed.\n\nWe can make a law to solve this problem. Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car. A special permit can still be given before a full license, and young drivers must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours. This way, we can protect young drivers across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a way to keep young people safe.",
            "I looked through the Library of Congress's library of early Edison films. I decided to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My study of the films focused on the way they were made and looked at the differences between most of the films and a few that were different.\n\nMost of the trick films from the time period are made in a box on a stage. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. This way of making films came from the theater and magic shows. It has some limitations. For example, people in the films can only move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera.\n\nIn the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors enter from one side and move back and forth. Even when they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nMost of the trick films from Edison are long shots. Sometimes they are medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because of the way the films were made for the stage and theater. The actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are not needed.\n\nMost of the early trick films are short. They are about one minute long. They are often short tricks, like magic and disappearing acts. However, some of the trick films are made by joining several shots together to make an illusion. If you look closely at the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), you can see where the shots are joined.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of Republicanism. He was a farmer, and his work and short time in politics made him known for his strong ideas about freedom and government. He believed a farm-based system was the best way to live. This idea influenced his thoughts on the government, its power, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to create a perfect system. There was no old tradition to follow, so the country's leaders could create a system where people could govern themselves. He believed in the natural rights of people. He thought that if one of these rights is taken away, all the rights are weakened. He believed government should not control these rights. He said that in a natural state, those with physical power and bad intentions often succeed. But in a civilized society, this should not be true.\n\nTo create a good society, Taylor thought the government must consider both good and evil in people. He believed in a simple good and evil view of the world. He said government is like people. It has good and bad qualities. He wanted a government that protects private property and helps farmers. He believed a good government would work well even if its leaders are not good. He thought self-interest is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it hurts others. A good government must keep people's natural evil in check.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that follows the Constitution exactly. He wanted a small federal government with only the powers listed in the Constitution. He thought a big government is expensive and might be unfair. He believed a simple interpretation of the Constitution can be bad if it ignores the writers' intentions. He thought the Declaration of Independence is the real charter of the United States because it says the country is a group of states, not one country.",
            "A Look at the Commuter Log Project\n\nThere was a big drop in the number of people who used the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a problem. It is hard to say why this happened. One reason may be the winter weather in New England. Fewer people use their bikes or walk to school when it is cold outside. \n\nAnother reason is that it was the end of the fall semester. Students were busy with schoolwork and final exams. They may have forgotten to use the log. December is also the start of the holiday season. Many students and faculty members do not need to be on campus during this time. When classes started again in January, the number of log submissions did not go up. This was a surprise.\n\nSome people think that any big project will have a lot of energy at the start, but then the interest will decrease. We tried to stop this from happening by creating the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special event in March to encourage people to use the log again. It helped to increase the number of submissions for that month.\n\nAnother problem with the project was that many people like to drive their cars. This is a part of our culture. We tried to make alternative forms of transportation more attractive by giving out prizes. People could win gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We thought this would make them want to use the log. We gave out these prizes for the whole project. \n\nWe thought it would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a new bike or a new car. This might have made more people participate. The prizes we gave did not change throughout the project. If the prizes had increased in value, it might have helped to keep people interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security. It is designed to follow a group of things, a product or a group of investments. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange. An ETF gives you the good things of a group investment and the good things of owning one stock. You can sell more stock than you own, buy some stock with money you borrow, and buy just one share at a time.\n\nETFs have many benefits. Their costs are lower than the costs of most mutual funds. But there are some bad points too. You have to pay a small fee for every trade like you do for a stock. There are also many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nIt is a good idea to check if the benefits an ETF says it has are true. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 investments. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning a group of the 10 stocks. We also want to see if we can find a better way to invest in the same stocks.\n\nTo make it easier, we will only look at the top 10 investments that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 investments and their percentage of the total.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a math formula. We will use the current percentage of assets to calculate how much each stock adds to a portfolio's risk and return if the portfolio was made up of only these 10 stocks. The calculations are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks makes 6.11% more money than the ETF. It also has a risk level that is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks might make more money with less risk. But we need to be sure that these results are real and not just chance.\n\nTo do this, we will look at how much each of the top 10 stocks can move up or down. We will then compare these numbers to the ETF's risk level. If the results are different, we can say that the ETF and the portfolio of 10 stocks are not the same.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his famous works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" twice. This word comes from the Roman poet Virgil. He used it to describe an island north of Britain. Many people think the Romans used the word to show the edge of the world.\n\nPoe liked the work of German writers. He was very interested in their writing. This is why we think he was influenced by the German writer Goethe. \n\nGoethe was a famous writer. He wrote a play called \"Faust\" in two parts. The first part was published in 1808 and the second part was published in 1832, the year he died. In \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king who loses his wife. He then drinks a lot and cries because he misses his wife. He decides it is time to die and gives away all his things. He throws a goblet into the sea and dies.\n\nPoe also wrote about Thule in another poem called \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He used the word \"ultma Thule\" in this poem. In \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the word \"Thulé\" at the beginning and end of the poem. This is interesting because \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely place. He sees a world with no color and is haunted by his dead friends. These scenes are very similar to \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nGoethe was a famous writer who Poe would have known. Poe liked the work of Alfred Tennyson, and Goethe was also well-known to Tennyson. Poe was exposed to Goethe's work when he read many reproductions of his writing.",
            "California law says a customer who gets hurt from slipping on a spill in a store can get extra money if the store manager knew about the spill but did nothing to clean it up. \n\nA customer named Jennifer Palmer was hurt after slipping on applesauce in a store called D&D Markets. She wants to prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted on purpose to harm her. To win, Palmer must show that Martin knew about the danger and ignored it. \n\nMartin was told about the spill twice, but he said he was busy eating dinner. Palmer can argue that Martin knew about the danger because many other customers were hurt from slipping in the store before she got hurt. She will say that Martin did not take care of the safety of his store.\n\nPalmer's claim that Martin acted on purpose to harm her is not very strong, but it is possible. Six customers slipped and fell in the store in one year, and Martin did not take action to fix the problem.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, Martin was told about the spill twice. He said he was too busy to deal with it. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt. Before she got hurt, five other customers slipped and fell in the store.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if they can prove that someone acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice\". Malice means acting on purpose to harm someone. If the person did not act on purpose, their behavior must be very bad and they must have been aware of the danger and ignored it.\n\nA court case from many years ago said that someone acts with malice when they ignore the danger and know that it will harm someone. In this case, Martin knew about the danger and ignored it, so a judge may not dismiss Palmer's claim for extra money.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One of the main topics we discussed was whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now this question is even more important than before.  After 9/11, I saw a big change in how the media viewed Islam.  It went from being very critical to being very accepting.  I think it would have been hard for someone like Barack Obama to run for president in 2001.  He has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nI am interested in the Biography of the Prophet.  What I know of the biography does not match the history of Muhammad.  I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam.  But the biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to see him because they believed in his teachings.  I also see some similarities between the life of Jesus and the stories of Muhammad.  One story is about Muhammad multiplying food and drink for many people.  This makes me think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a kind and special person.  This is not fair to Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography about people converting to Islam.  But most of the stories come from other people, not from the people who converted.  This makes me doubt the stories.  The writers also try to make Muhammad seem like a kind and wise man.  But history says he was not kind and humble.  I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's early teachings and beliefs are not the same today.  If we look at history, we see that Christianity moved away from its beginnings after Jesus died.  Today, people are becoming more aware and understanding of the past.  They are looking deeper into the true meaning of Christianity.  This will lead to a change in the way people think about their faith.  In the future, many Christians will look back at the teachings added to the religion and compare them to Jesus' original message.  This process will take time, but it is sure to happen.  One day, people will return to Jesus' ideas and throw away the extra teachings that were added over time.  The church will remain strong and lead the way.\n\nThis change will make Christianity more alike everywhere.  People will look and believe in the same way.  This is similar to other events in history.  For example, the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, but later it became Christian.  Our country once had slavery, but now an African-American can be president.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the beginning and understand Jesus' true message.  This will happen because people will learn to understand Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact statements.\n\nSo, what happened to Jesus' teachings?  If we look back in time, we see that the Jewish people were the first to believe in one God.  They believed in a divinely given message and the importance of the Hebrew scriptures.  Before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in sixty-three B.C.E., the Jewish people were divided into different groups.  These groups were the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many ordinary people.",
            "The book \"The Jungle\" shows how people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want to make their lives better. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One way is with the owners and managers of big factories. They only want to make their factories bigger and better. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way. They do not care if their pollution hurts people or animals.\n\nThe author of the book, Upton Sinclair, says that the factories are making a lot of pollution. This is bad for people and the Earth. The factories are also very dirty. The author says that the owners do not care about the people who work for them. They want to make money, and they do not care about their workers' well-being.\n\nThe workers are treated very badly. They have to work long hours, and they are not paid well. The owners can lay them off at any time without giving them help finding a new job. In the past, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant that the owners could do what they wanted. The workers were like slaves. They were very poor and had no way to get help.\n\nThe author says that this is not right. He says that workers should be treated fairly and given help when they need it. The book shows how people can be treated unfairly and how they can be forced to live in bad conditions.",
            "Many writers use special techniques to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. Some of these methods are better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. \n\nFitzgerald pairs words together in new ways to give a special feeling about a subject. He also uses symbols to mean something, and then uses them again to remind readers of that feeling. Fitzgerald uses this method with many colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. He builds up a meaning for these colors, and then uses that meaning to create a special feeling about a subject.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to mean the same thing - uniformity. He thinks white is better and more upper class, while gray is old and faded. He starts to use these colors at the beginning of the novel. Many people wear white: Daisy and Jordan always wear white, Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party, and Tom wears a white shirt. Only when Nick is not with the wealthy people is the color white not used.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. He says the streets of New York are like white chasms, the names of people at Gatsby's party are gray, and Catherine's apartment is just one small part of a long row of white buildings. He uses white and gray to describe regular people or places. \n\nAfter Fitzgerald uses these colors enough times, he starts to use them to show readers that something is unimportant or boring. He starts with Daisy. He describes her as wearing white and gray clothes, and readers start to see her as just a regular person, not a special one. Fitzgerald uses this method again to make readers see Daisy as less important. \n\nFitzgerald also describes Daisy's fur as gray, and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's meeting. He uses these colors again to show readers that Daisy is not special, just a regular person.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The weather is warm and sunny. Many crops grow well here. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a big market for food from local farms. Many people want to buy organic food. This means the food is grown without chemicals. There are many groups in San Diego that support this kind of farming. These groups have long waiting lists.\n\nSome farms also offer tours. People can visit the farms to see how the food is grown. They can also walk or hike in the area. This is fun for people who like the outdoors.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps animals and plants. The soil and water are cleaner. However, organic farming can be more expensive. It requires more work to remove pests and weeds. The farmer must also add natural fertilizer to the soil.\n\nThe land in this example is near the town of Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The land is next to a national forest. The area has many plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are becoming less common, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land was once home to Native Americans. Later, people raised cattle and sold wood here. The land was part of a farm a long time ago.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a real estate website. I looked at government programs to see how a small farmer could save money and help the environment. I also found an organic farm in the same area as an example of what might be done with this land.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. Culture is not one thing. It can be different in different ways and not the same everywhere. We often make general statements about cultures, like \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating.\" But these statements are too broad and not true for everyone in a country. Instead of making general statements, it is better to understand what a culture means in a situation and how it can affect talks at the negotiating table. \n\nWhen we meet a foreign culture, we see it in a way that is like our own culture, so we make comparisons. To understand a foreign culture, we can learn about its history or its problems. We should not judge or try to change a culture. We should accept it and work within its limits, especially in a negotiation. If we are in a weaker position, showing respect for traditions and values can help us get past cultural differences and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just between countries. Companies have their own cultures too. A company's culture can be seen in how its employees dress, communicate, or do their jobs. Some companies value hard work and long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. If we look at American companies, we can see how different they can be from each other. Even within a company, there can be different cultures in different parts of the country or in different cities.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because they show us why a culture does things. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not publicly criticize their company or boss. If a culture values making a hard bargain, a negotiator will not settle too quickly. Knowing these things can help us negotiate more effectively. We should also try to learn about our opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation successful.",

We will assume they are talking about the same God.\n\nSt. Anselm says we can know God exists in our minds. He says we cannot think of a God who does not exist.

This religion is about 2,500 years old. It has changed over time. You can see this in Sri Lanka, a country with many Theravada Buddhists. There, people celebrate the water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and ordinary people participate in this ceremony. It has some meaning, but Buddha never taught about it.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened for many reasons. Some changes came from inside the community. Some came from people outside the community. Some of these changes were good, and some were bad.\n\nThere are some important terms to understand. An internal force is a change that comes from people inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a change that comes from people outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is a change that hurts the Buddhist community. A benign force is a change that does not mean to harm the Buddhist community. These terms will be used often in this discussion.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of the Tripitaka, a collection of Buddhist books. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, which are Buddhist teachings. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the nature of reality. These ideas include Anatta (there is no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything is impermanent). When people understand these ideas, they can end the cycle of death and rebirth. They can also end lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). This happens when they become enlightened.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. For ordinary people, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have bad sex, and do not take drugs. For monks and nuns, there are many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, desire causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once rivals for 57 years. This rivalry lasted from 1836 to 1893. One of the biggest fights between the two countries was the Mexican-American War. The United States won this war in 1846-1848. It got Texas and the American Southwest as new land. Many other fights happened between the two nations. These fights stopped just before World War One.\n\nThe two countries had disagreements on many things, including religion and culture. They also had different interests. This is true for many countries that share a border. They often have disagreements that make their relationship difficult.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are like other countries that have been rivals with a neighbor. David M. Pletcher said, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba did the United States have long-lasting problems.\" These countries are close to the United States and have been rivals. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a problem between the two countries. Many countries have had disagreement about religion in the past. One expert said, \"If Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries.\"\n\nThese two countries had a distrust of each other. This distrust came from the English and Spanish. They were the colonial rulers of the area. This made it hard for the United States and Mexico to be friends.\n\nThe two countries had 17 disagreements during the 57 years of rivalry. Most of these disagreements were about land. The United States and Mexico had problems with bandits and outlaws on their border. They had to use the military to stop these problems.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries began to end when Mexico needed the United States for help. Later, the United States changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick with an illness I did not know I had. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job for safety and security. People told me that finding work would always be easy because people are always sick. So, I chose nursing instead of being a scientist or journalist.\n\nBut I was 46 years old, single, and had no money. I could not work. I am still sick, and I have been living on disability money for 15 years. I have nothing left that is mine. Every day is hard and makes me feel less safe and less good about myself. I know one thing is true: I would not have made it without the help of my family and friends. They are very kind to me.\n\nI know that bad things happen in life. Some things are too hard to handle by ourselves. We should not depend on the government to help us in hard times. But we should help each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nSome Americans say we should be independent and strong like our ancestors. But our ancestors did not make it alone. They helped each other and shared what they had.\n\nSo, be prepared for emergencies. I have a kit with supplies and a plan. I have food, water, and tools. If you can, grow your own food and be ready for hard times. But also know your neighbors and ask for help when you need it.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? \n\nA long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that biologists have not yet found a way to explain even simple shapes in scientific language. Today, we still have not solved this problem. However, we are trying to use math to understand how animals develop and change over time.\n\nWe are studying a type of animal called Prunum. We want to know how its shell develops and changes over time. We used pictures of the animals to measure the shell's shape and size. We put this information into a computer program to create new, possible shell shapes. These shapes can help us understand how the shell can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It turns around in a circle, making a spiral shape. This spiral shape is called a whorl. The center of the shell is called the columella. The shell grows in size and makes new whorls over time. Each new whorl is separated from the old one by a line called a suture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, or from the front. When we look at a shell from the front, we see the opening of the shell, called the aperture.\n\nWe can count the number of whorls on a shell by looking at it from the top. We draw a line on the shell and count the whorls from that line. We can also look at the path of the opening of the shell as the animal grows. We can use math to describe this path and change the shape of the shell.\n\nBy using math to describe how the shell grows, we can change the shape of the shell and understand how it developed. This can help us understand how animals change over time and how they evolve.",
            "Indonesia's health system has a problem. Many babies and young children are dying. This is not getting better. Indonesia wants to meet some of the United Nations' goals by 2015. But it is not making progress in health for babies and mothers.\n\nThe number of births where a skilled health worker is present has increased. Now 72% of births have a skilled worker. But many of these workers are not doctors or nurses. They are midwives who cannot help in emergency situations. This means many mothers are still dying from bleeding.\n\nFewer children are getting medical help for diarrhea. And not enough mothers are getting help after giving birth. This is a big problem.\n\nDoctors are not performing enough operations on pregnant women. Only 4% of women have cesarean sections. But in cities, 7% of women have this operation. In the countryside, it is only 2%. This shows that rich people can get health care, but poor people cannot.\n\nThe poor have a hard time getting health care. They have to pay out of their own money. This makes it hard for them to get the help they need.\n\nThe question is how to make the health system better. Should Indonesia make special programs for babies and mothers, or should it make the whole health system stronger? Making special programs can help, but it can also cause problems. It can take money away from other areas of health care. And it can make it hard to coordinate services.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the aristocracy.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels use mystery and strange situations to make the characters more interesting. This makes it easier for readers to understand their feelings and motives.\n\nA famous example is from the book Oliver Twist. The main character, Oliver, is confused and scared. He hears voices in his head and sees strange things. He is trying to understand what is happening to him. Oliver is talking to two men, Sikes and Crackit, but they are not real. He is still thinking about them even when he is in a different place. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise and sees lights. He is taken away quickly.\n\nIn these strange situations, Oliver learns more about himself and the world around him. He finds out about the true nature of things and what is happening to him. Oliver's health is getting worse, and he is having trouble controlling what is happening to him. He is scared and in pain. He does not have control over his life, and this makes him feel defeated.\n\nThe same thing happens in Wuthering Heights. The author uses strange and dreamlike situations to make the characters more interesting and to show their feelings and motives. The two novels are different from other Victorian novels because they use mystery and strange situations in a different way.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students with their school work, but my strengths were in English and reading. I helped a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. He spoke perfect English, but he had a problem with some letters. This was strange. His mother did not speak English. She spoke Spanish. We used my little Spanish to talk. I understood then that Adrian had trouble with the English alphabet. He could read, but he did not know the alphabet well.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language barrier can be a big problem in school. Even if a student speaks perfect English, reading can still be hard. I think we all agree that this is a problem. What can we do? For Adrian, I helped him with English reading. But for other students who do not speak much English, it is more complicated. There is no simple answer. We need to use many solutions together.\n\nOne good idea is a dual language system. This means teaching in two languages, like English and Spanish. This can help all students, not just those who speak Spanish at home. Studies show that students in two-way bilingual programs do better in school. Some people are afraid that this system will waste money and will not help most students. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all students will benefit.\n\nSo, how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. These helpers can work with teachers to help students who need it. This can help students who do not speak much English.",
            "Most of us learn about something bigger than ourselves when we are young. Some people go to church, others to temple, and some search inside themselves for answers. We learn about the world around us from our parents. But some of us reject what they tell us. We look for our own path in life. We want to understand what is beyond our own world. We look for a light in the dark to guide us.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. We sat on our porch during a rainstorm. He looked out into the rain. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and scared. I didn't talk to him about how much I would miss him. I just hugged him and sat with him.\n\nMy father died in December when I was 22. He had cancer. He didn't get better even with treatment. I didn't want to watch him die. I wanted to remember him alive, not dead. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he wouldn't want me to watch him die. I stayed in bed for three days, waiting for news.\n\nNobody called me.",
            "The Gothic Novel: A New Old Thing\n\nThe Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" (Watt) Some people do not like it because it does not have deep meaning. Others praise it for its powerful and exciting qualities. The first Gothic Novel was Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. It used ideas from old romances and modern novels to create a new kind of story. Walpole mixed old and new things to create something new.\n\nThe Gothic Novel uses old ideas from the Middle Ages, like theater, architecture, and traditions. People thought the word \"Gothic\" was old-fashioned. They thought it was not as good as modern ideas. The Gothic Novel combines old and new things in a way that makes it interesting and new for a long time. This is why it has lasted so long.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a knight to be brave, honest, and good. The Gothic writers liked this idea because they thought it was missing in their society. They used chivalric ideas to make the past seem better than the present. This was especially true for Horace Walpole, who was writing about a time of trouble. He was unhappy with the way people were behaving. In his Novel, The Castle of Otranto, he created a character named Frederic. Frederic is a good example of a chivalric knight. He is a prince, he has been hurt by bad things, and he is supposed to be a brave and honest man.",
            "Supply chain management is a process that gets goods from customers to products. It includes planning and controlling the flow of goods from raw materials to customers. The term \"supply chain management\" was first used by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers. \n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production. Production is the base of the supply chain. It decides when, why, where, and how things are made. To know what customers want, managers look at the market. The market tells managers what customers need. \n\nManagers decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products. They choose a place that can make the products in big numbers and with good quality. They must remember to make sure customers are happy. \n\nThe next step is to plan work and take care of equipment. Production is very important in the supply chain. If every step is not planned, it can cost a company a lot of time and money. \n\nThe second key part of the supply chain is supply. Supply is making good decisions about a company's ability and partnerships. Managers decide which parts of the company can do each job best. They might also send some work to other companies to make things faster and cheaper. This is called outsourcing. It helps a company be flexible and provide good quality at a low cost.\n\nIn my past job at Wal-Mart and Target, we had printed books and clear processes for every part of the business. This kept everything running smoothly and helped us know what to do. Having a plan helps a company work well and avoid mistakes.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, a sign says. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a cardboard sign with a scary message. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia ruled by a bad government. The government took power in 1962 by force. In 2007, people began to protest. These were the first public protests in ten years. The protests were led by many monks. They wore yellow robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution. \n\nAt first, the government let the monks have peaceful meetings. But soon, the government became violent. They attacked the monks and the monasteries in the country. They arrested foreign journalists and killed one. A Japanese journalist was killed on September 27th, 2007. He was only there to take pictures of the protest. Many people were killed, but the government only said 13 died. \n\nThis is not new. Governments have been trying to control their people for a long time. In ancient Rome, the emperors thought they were gods. In Japan, the emperors were believed to be gods too. They said they came to Earth to make people's lives better. Our current president had a bad friend, Ted Haggard. He led a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere have been many bad examples like this. In 1989, many people protested against the Chinese government in Tiananmen Square. The government said 200-300 people died, but other groups said 2,000-3,000 people died. In the 1990s, people in Rwanda were killed because of their ethnic group. This was called a genocide. The Nazis, led by Hitler, also killed many people who were Jewish. This happened in several countries over many years.",
            "Duke Ellington had a great influence on jazz. He lived a long life and had many years to make music. This helped him create many new and interesting pieces. In some of his music, you do not hear him play the piano much. But when he did play, it was usually to help the other musicians. \n\nEllington was very good at writing music that showed off what each musician could do. He gave them room to play freely and make up their own music. He also wrote music with many parts that worked together well. This made the orchestra sound new and original.\n\nEllington knew how to make each musician sound good on their own. He also knew how to make them sound good together. This helped him write some of the most creative and excellent music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's music. It says he used the human voice as a special instrument. This was something new and exciting in his time. He did this in many of his songs. \n\nOne of Ellington's early songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example. In this song, the voice is used in a special way. It adds texture and color to the music without using lyrics. This was a new idea at the time.\n\nCreole Love Call is a slow and bluesy song with six parts. Here is what happens in each part:\n\nPart 1: The voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other in a special way.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a long and slow solo.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and high solo with a piano that plays in a special way.\nPart 4: The whole band plays the first part again with the brass and woodwind sections talking to each other.\nPart 5: The woodwind sections play a fast and high call and response, with the brass and rhythm sections playing in a special way.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, but the voice sounds different. It sounds like it is growling like an animal.\n\nThe song ends with a short part that has a high-pitched sound and a strange finish by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add color to his music is a special thing that he did in many of his songs.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music to make it sound good. He uses a trumpet player and a singer to create a special sound. The singer is not singing words, but using sounds like an instrument. \n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to make the music sound interesting. The trombone player plays a special sound that makes the song sound exciting.",

The study showed that eating a diet like this can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe Mediterranean Diet is a special way of eating. It includes a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables. It also includes fish and small amounts of alcohol. The study used a special score to measure how closely people followed this diet.\n\nPrevious studies showed that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be good for you. It can help you lose weight and lower your cholesterol levels. But previous studies did not look at how it affects stroke.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women from the United States who were between 38 and 63 years old. They did not have heart disease or diabetes. The study followed them for 20 years.\n\nThe women were asked every few years about their eating habits. They were asked about the foods they ate and how often they ate them. More than 95% of the women kept participating in the study throughout the 20 years.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a Mediterranean Diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They also had a lower risk of dying from heart disease or stroke. The study controlled for other factors that could affect the results, like smoking and physical activity.\n\nThe study showed that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be very good for you.

            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market fell down. Many big companies went out of business. This problem still exists today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The problem started because some people in government made bad decisions. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake because the banks did not have enough money to lend. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two important companies, bought these bad loans and sold them to others. \n\nThis was a bad idea. When people could not pay back their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold these bad loans to others, and the problem spread to the whole economy. \n\nThe problem started in 1999. The President at the time, Bill Clinton, wanted to be elected again. He wanted to make people happy, so he changed the rules for lending money. This made it easy to give loans to people who could not pay them back. A news reporter named Steven Holmes wrote in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae is giving loans to people who cannot pay them back.\" He said this could cause big problems if there was a crisis. \n\nMany things combined to make the problem worse. New kinds of loans, like adjustable-rate mortgages, were used. These loans are not good because they can increase the amount of money people owe. Many people in the United States borrowed too much money and bought too many houses. This made the economy very weak. When the housing market fell, many people could not pay their loans. The banks were in trouble. The top five big banks in the United States had a combined debt of $4.1 trillion dollars. This was a big problem. Two banks, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold very cheap. Another bank, Lehman Brothers, went out of business. Some other banks, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had to become commercial banks and follow strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in debt and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Many writers struggle with exposition.  This is the part of a story where you explain too much.  This can be boring for readers.\n\nYou already know the writing tip, \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes.  She writes long parts with no action.  This is not what you want.\n\nExposition is like a devil on your shoulder.  It says, \"Get this information out of the way so you can get to the good parts.\"\n\nExposition is when you tell the reader what happened.  In a movie, this is like one character talking too much.  In a story, the writer is doing the telling.\n\nA good example is when you read a story and learn about the main character's husband.  You learn that he is a good person and that she loves him very much.  But this does not happen in one or two lines of dialogue.  The writer wants you to like the husband and feel sad when he dies.\n\nSo, the writer should show you how much the main character loves her husband.  This can be through what she says and does.  This way, you can feel sad with her when he dies.  You will also learn more about her character.\n\nIn short, you want meat on the bone of the story.  You want to learn about the characters and feel what they feel.\n\nAs a writer, you need to give your reader that meat.  You should not rush through parts of the story.  You should make the reader want to keep reading.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first program was \"live\" from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They talked about this story for about two minutes because it was still happening.\n\nThe second story was about a young man, 18 years old, named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was very badly hurt. The police had not found anyone to arrest yet. They were investigating. This story was short, but I think it was because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed that when a black person is a victim of a crime, the news does not talk about it as much. If a white person is a victim, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. They talked about where the helicopter crashed and what kind of bullet hit it. They were asking for help to catch the person who did it. They offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said there would be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid-eighties for the weekend.\n\nThey also talked about a store robbery on Clime Road. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. They talked about his skin color a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was convicted of selling a lot of marijuana to people in Ohio from Texas. I noticed they talked about how long he was sentenced to prison, thirty years, instead of saying three hundred months. I don't know why they said it that way. They also said he was Hispanic, but that was not important to the story.",

            "The human brain is a complex system that processes information. As technology has changed, people have used different ways to describe the brain. Early people compared it to a flat piece of wax, then to a piece of paper, and now to a computer. These comparisons are helpful, but they have limits.\n\nThe brain takes in information from the senses. These include touch, heat, sound, and light. The brain changes this information into electrical signals. It does this again and again in two processes: bottom-up and top-down.\n\nImagine looking at a picture of a black box. Bottom-up processing puts together simple information like color and shape. It helps you see the box. Top-down processing uses this information to help you identify the box. It helps you understand what it is.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what to focus on. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain does not notice individual blades of grass. But it can hear your name even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information and uses it again later. There are three kinds of memory: short-term, working memory, and long-term. Information is first encoded, or put into the brain. There are different ways to encode different kinds of information. For example, written words can be encoded based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean.\n\nThe brain keeps information in different ways. Working memory holds information for a short time, about 20 seconds. Long-term memory is stored in the structure of special kinds of proteins.\n\nScientists have many different ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some are based on how people remember things, others on how computers work, and others on how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected nodes, or points. Each node represents a concept, and they are connected based on how they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wood.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in his book Brave New World. He criticizes the way people will live under a system controlled by technology and capitalism. The people in the book value being with friends above being an individual. They are taught from a young age to be happy now, not to think about the future. The citizens are like pawns in a game. They must do what the World Controller says. By looking at the book from a Marxist point of view, we can see that Huxley did not like the way capitalism was growing at that time.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism by showing how people are not free to make their own choices. They are forced to buy things they do not need and to work hard to get more things. The people in the book, like the Delta and Gamma classes, do not have the power to make choices. They are controlled by the World Controller. He makes them want to buy and use things. This is like the idea of false consciousness in Marxism. The people do not know how the system works, and they are not free.\n\nThe people in the book do not have real relationships with each other. They are not allowed to feel deep emotions like love or happiness. They only care about how they look and what they have. The way people interact with each other in the book shows that they are not free to be themselves. They are like robots, doing what they are told.\n\nThe people in the book are happy to be in their place in society. They do not want to change. This is like the idea of the proletariat in Marxism. The people are controlled by the system, and they are happy to be controlled. They are not aware of how the system works, and they do not want to know.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be difficult. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, which is on the far side of campus. Going to classes in buildings like Willard, near the center, took 25 minutes on foot. The weather was often bad, so it took even longer. I talked to a graduate who said that not long ago, East Halls was far from other buildings. Now it is surrounded by sports fields, new buildings, and apartments.\n\nAs campus grows, getting around becomes harder. One good solution is a bicycle. But students need to ride them and the campus needs to be good for bicyclists. My friend recently started riding again. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the only way to get around.\" Bicycling is also good for your body. It's the best way to travel on campus. I live off campus, near Thomas building. My bike takes me there in 5 minutes. The road to Thomas is not always easy to ride on. Walking is also good, but I am too busy. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk, which would take 30-40 minutes. That is 2 1/2 hours a week. I don't have that much time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week.

            "I want to study social work to help children who have been hurt or neglected. I also want to help families in trouble. I believe in three important values: serving others, showing respect, and acting honestly. These values are important for all social workers, and they are also important to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I did not know what job I wanted to do. While I was in high school and college, I saw many people ignoring their problems. Some people used bad ways to deal with their problems. Because of what I saw, I decided to study psychology. I still did not know what job I wanted, so I took a break after I finished college. One summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was very nervous. He was there because his parents were being mean to him. I called the police and told them I had studied psychology in college. They asked me to talk to the parents. When I asked them about the boy, they seemed nervous and made excuses. After that, I decided to study social work to help children like the boy.\n\nAnother important value is fairness. We say that every person is important, but we do not always act that way. We say we value individuality, but we often do what others do. I do not like to do what others do. I like to be myself. In high school and college, I stood up against unfairness whenever I could. I wore clothes that were not like what others wore. I protested against racism and unfairness when I saw it. I believe in fairness, and I will continue to stand up for what I believe in.",
            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model focuses on genetic information and medical health issues. The Sociocultural model looks at how environment and social factors affect sleep. This review will examine research on these models and explain each study. We will look at the strengths and weaknesses of each study to better understand the models.\n\nThere are different types of sleep disorders. Some are primary sleep disorders. Others are related to mental or medical problems. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to a mental disorder are linked to a major mental illness. Other sleep disorders are caused by medical problems or a person's behavior.\n\nDyssonmias are sleep disorders that affect how we sleep. Some Dyssonmias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia is a problem with sleeping too little. Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with sleeping too much. Narcolepsy causes people to fall asleep suddenly. Dyssonmias are about falling asleep and staying asleep.\n\nParasomnias are sleep disorders that cause behavioral problems or physical reactions. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to a mental illness are linked to an Axis I (serious mental illness) or Axis II (personality disorder or mental disability) disorder.\n\nThis review will focus on insomnia and primary sleep disorders. It will look at the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetic factors, hereditary traits, and physical aspects of sleep. A study on mice found that neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin control sleep and wakefulness. The study found that mice with a specific receptor on these neurons had problems with sleep and wake states. Researchers found that a chemical (baclofen) that activated the receptor helped mice sleep. This study suggests that there may be a genetic and environmental basis for sleep problems in humans. This could affect a person's ability to sleep without medicine.\n\nThe Sociocultural implication of this study is that if the receptor is inherited, it could affect a person's sleep. This could impact daily life, such as school, work, or other tasks that require concentration.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we explain what the disorder is. Next, we explain how to diagnose it. Finally, we talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem where the brain does not work correctly with sounds. People with CAPD can hear normally. They do not have a hearing problem. But their brain cannot separate sounds or understand speech in noisy places. This is not the same as being deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThe study of CAPD began in the 1950s. Researchers were trying to understand children with speech and hearing problems. They made tests to help them. A doctor named Kimura created a way to test how the brain works with sounds in the 1960s.\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble hearing where sounds come from. They may have trouble telling two sounds apart. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may have trouble understanding speech. They may not be able to hear one sound because of another sound. They may not be able to understand what sounds mean.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a doctor must test the person with CAPD. The doctor may use questionnaires, observe how the person behaves, or use special tests. These tests can check how the person hears and responds to sounds. There is no one test that works for everyone. But doctors use many different tests to try to understand what is happening.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom. First, the teacher should sit near the student. This way, the student can see the teacher's face and hear them more easily. The teacher should also avoid background noise. This can make it harder for the student to hear. The teacher should speak clearly and loudly, but not too loudly. The teacher should also give the student extra time to answer questions. This can help the student understand what is being said.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that using a disguise can help people trick others. But, it can also cause problems. If a person stays in disguise too long, they may lose their true self. Ending a deception can be hard because it may hurt relationships.\n\nThe play is especially interesting when it talks about people changing their gender. This raises many questions. Why do people want to disguise themselves as the opposite sex? In the play, a character named Viola wants to change her sex to protect herself. She is a woman who is alone in a new place. She decides to pretend to be a man so she can be safe.\n\nViola's plan works. But it also separates her from other women. She is good at acting like a man that others start to think she is really a man. Another character, Olivia, falls in love with Viola but does not know she is a woman. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino but is pretending to be a man so she cannot be honest about her feelings.\n\nThe play may show that people can use a disguise to discover hidden feelings. Two characters, Olivia and Orsino, may have feelings for each other that they do not express openly. When Viola appears as a man, they are forced to think about their feelings. But, it is not clear if Olivia really likes Viola or just likes the way Viola looks. The play may be saying that people make judgments based on how others look.\n\nThis is shown when Olivia quickly switches her love from Viola to Viola's twin brother, Sebastian. She starts to see Viola as a sister rather than a love interest. The play is saying that people may not be honest about their feelings and may judge others based on how they look.",
            "German rule in Africa was very bad. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. But German rule was not the same everywhere. Each colony had its own ideas and ways of doing things. Schools in the colonies were also different. When the British took control of German East Africa (now known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. Germans had also built good schools in Kamerun and other colonies.\n\nBut the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was different. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach the local people. In South West Africa, the government left most of the teaching to missionaries. The government did give some money to the missionaries, but not enough. The government, however, built many schools for Europeans living in the colony. They also controlled and supported the schools run by missionaries. This policy had a big effect on South West Africa even after German rule ended. Many Africans in South West Africa did not learn to read and write.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated and literate Africans. But in South West Africa, “most of the people were not educated, not literate.” Many things caused this difference. This paper wants to discuss these things and look at how the people who ruled the colony and the settlers felt about the local people.\n\nThere is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of these writings describe the schools in the colonies. Later writings compared the schools in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. These studies showed that the schools in each colony were different. One important study was done by Cohen. He compared the schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the large number of settlers in South West Africa helped create the differences in the education system there.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of it was desert. The number of European settlers in the colony was small compared to the population of East Africa. By 1913, about 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 Europeans lived in East Africa.",
            "The music called Popular Music has grown over the past 100 years. It has many kinds. It is hard to list them all. Many kinds of music have smaller kinds. For example, the kind called Heavy Metal rock has many smaller kinds. Heavy Metal rock is expressive. It shows a wide range of feelings. It is mostly on the darker side. \n\nHeavy Metal rock is also very diverse. Many people started to make their own smaller kinds of Heavy Metal rock. This continued for many years. Today, there are many kinds of Heavy Metal music. It is hard to say what exactly Heavy Metal is. It has taken parts from other kinds of music. But it started from somewhere. To understand the kind of music we have today, we need to know what Heavy Metal is and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy Metal is a movement that is often about things that are dark. It is often loud and violent. It can be very theatrical. People who make Heavy Metal music are very good at their instruments. Heavy Metal music often comes from using strong drugs. There was a time when many people were using strong drugs. This led to music that was very strange and new. Many later kinds of Heavy Metal music took parts from the dark and exciting qualities of old music. Some songs, like Helter Skelter, show the darker side of music. This song is from the Beatles. It is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made because the Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous artist. He painted many pictures. One of his most famous works is called The Dream. It was painted in 1910.\n\nThe Dream is more than just a picture of a woman in a dream. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be a great artist. He wanted people to like his work.\n\nRousseau had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by other artists. But he also wanted to be his own person. He wanted to paint in his own way, not like others. This made him very unhappy.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in a small town in France. His father was a worker. Rousseau had no special training in art. He worked as a toll collector. At home, he had a daughter and a lot of grief. He started painting to make himself happy.\n\nRousseau wanted to be like other artists. He saw them painting beautiful pictures. He wanted to be good too. But Rousseau's paintings were different. He painted simple things, like the world around him. He was a folk painter.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous. He wanted people to like his art. But it was hard. Many other artists were famous. They had been painting for a long time. Rousseau was older when he started. He didn't get famous until later.\n\nA man named Jan Gordon wrote about Rousseau and another artist named Matisse. Matisse was a good painter. He didn't want to paint like others. He wanted to be different. Rousseau wanted to be like everyone else. He wanted to be accepted.\n\nRousseau's story is an example of a person who wanted to be accepted by others. But he also wanted to be himself. It's a big problem to solve.",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested a strong connection between ethics and beauty. They believe that at a basic level, there is a reason for this connection. John Keats wrote in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to like ethics and beauty without being taught these things in school. Both ethics and beauty are attempts to describe, not tell us what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are attempts to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right, rather than a set of rules.\n\nIn fact, we cannot fully understand what is good or beautiful by just talking about it. For example, a conversation about the Mona Lisa by da Vinci may talk about its background, foreground, and contrast. But these things do not explain why it is a good piece of art. When we like a work of art or literature, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think both art and morals cannot be fully explained. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how much we describe a work of literature, there is something more.\n\nI think ethics and art are similar because we experience both most strongly in a way that cannot be fully explained. This is true, especially for literature. As McKean said, \"Literature has a moral quality that is unique. It is connected to our values in life.\" We need values to live. Literature is important because it gives us values.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture that comes from many different groups and tribes. The culture can be seen in many parts of the country, from the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It can also be seen in Köln on the Rhine River, in the center of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany's culture is special because it has a long history. Many different groups lived in the area that is now Germany. The country's name, Germania, comes from the Germanic tribes. But where the name came from is not clear. Some historians think it came from a tribe known as the Tungrians. They were a group of people who lived in the area before they moved across the Rhine River and fought with the Gauls.\n\nJulius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the people he was fighting against. Caesar learned the word from the Gauls themselves. They used it to describe their neighbors. Caesar used the word to show the difference between the Gauls and the Germans.\n\nThe origin of the word \"German\" is not clear. Some people think it came from the spear that the Germanic tribes used in battle. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This might mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said that the Germans were a separate group of people who did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild and cold country, and they were not interested in leaving their homes to go to other places.\n\nFor a long time, the Romans did not conquer Germany. They did not want to live there. Instead, they would send soldiers to the area to get goods and to trade with the Germanic tribes. The Germanic tribes would often serve in the Roman army, and they would bring their skills back to their own homes.",
            "I stared down at the bowl in front of me. My mind was empty. I was not thinking about the picture in front of me. I was just looking at it.\n\nWhen I was a child, I wanted to learn how to draw. I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches how to understand art. One way it teaches is to use a square frame around a picture. This helps you see the picture clearly.\n\nBut at that moment, I could not think about a frame. The bowl was too busy and complicated. I was amazed by it.\n\nI wanted to be an artist. Picasso liked blue, Monet liked green, and the Renaissance masters liked many colors. I thought the bowl could be my painting, my story, called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI picked up my pencil. My hand moved, and my mind made something new. Water was flowing, and things were moving away. But then my hand hit the toilet handle again. The brown package would not move. It was stuck.\n\nI was unhappy. I had a mop in my hand and a green tie around my neck. I looked at the dirty package and thought about the people who clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. I wanted to make it go away.\n\nI flushed the toilet again. Then I used toilet paper to fix my hand. I bent down to get the package. My hand went into the water like a mother cooking a turkey.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Several things make this a big problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers also do not have much experience. This lack of experience causes more accidents and makes them drive too fast or drive off the road.\n\nTeenagers also drive badly when they have friends in the car. A study in California found that when the young passenger is older, there are more car accidents.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teens by requiring temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and say they cannot have other young people in the car.\n\nBut some people think that is not enough. They say teens are not ready to drive safely. A psychologist says that even 18 is too young to drive. He says young people like to take risks for fun. This means we should wait until they are older before they can drive. If we let young teens drive, many more people will be hurt or killed.\n\nWe can make a law to solve this problem. Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car. A special permit can still be given before a full license, and young drivers must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours. This way, we can protect young drivers across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a way to keep young people safe.",
            "I looked through the Library of Congress's library of early Edison films. I decided to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My study of the films focused on the way they were made and looked at the differences between most of the films and a few that were different.\n\nMost of the trick films from the time period are made in a box on a stage. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. This way of making films came from the theater and magic shows. It has some limitations. For example, people in the films can only move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera.\n\nIn the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors enter from one side and move back and forth. Even when they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nMost of the trick films from Edison are long shots. Sometimes they are medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because of the way the films were made for the stage and theater. The actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are not needed.\n\nMost of the early trick films are short. They are about one minute long. They are often short tricks, like magic and disappearing acts. However, some of the trick films are made by joining several shots together to make an illusion. If you look closely at the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), you can see where the shots are joined.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of Republicanism. He was a farmer, and his work and short time in politics made him known for his strong ideas about freedom and government. He believed a farm-based system was the best way to live. This idea influenced his thoughts on the government, its power, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to create a perfect system. There was no old tradition to follow, so the country's leaders could create a system where people could govern themselves. He believed in the natural rights of people. He thought that if one of these rights is taken away, all the rights are weakened. He believed government should not control these rights. He said that in a natural state, those with physical power and bad intentions often succeed. But in a civilized society, this should not be true.\n\nTo create a good society, Taylor thought the government must consider both good and evil in people. He believed in a simple good and evil view of the world. He said government is like people. It has good and bad qualities. He wanted a government that protects private property and helps farmers. He believed a good government would work well even if its leaders are not good. He thought self-interest is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it hurts others. A good government must keep people's natural evil in check.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that follows the Constitution exactly. He wanted a small federal government with only the powers listed in the Constitution. He thought a big government is expensive and might be unfair. He believed a simple interpretation of the Constitution can be bad if it ignores the writers' intentions. He thought the Declaration of Independence is the real charter of the United States because it says the country is a group of states, not one country.",
            "A Look at the Commuter Log Project\n\nThere was a big drop in the number of people who used the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a problem. It is hard to say why this happened. One reason may be the winter weather in New England. Fewer people use their bikes or walk to school when it is cold outside. \n\nAnother reason is that it was the end of the fall semester. Students were busy with schoolwork and final exams. They may have forgotten to use the log. December is also the start of the holiday season. Many students and faculty members do not need to be on campus during this time. When classes started again in January, the number of log submissions did not go up. This was a surprise.\n\nSome people think that any big project will have a lot of energy at the start, but then the interest will decrease. We tried to stop this from happening by creating the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special event in March to encourage people to use the log again. It helped to increase the number of submissions for that month.\n\nAnother problem with the project was that many people like to drive their cars. This is a part of our culture. We tried to make alternative forms of transportation more attractive by giving out prizes. People could win gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We thought this would make them want to use the log. We gave out these prizes for the whole project. \n\nWe thought it would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a new bike or a new car. This might have made more people participate. The prizes we gave did not change throughout the project. If the prizes had increased in value, it might have helped to keep people interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security. It is designed to follow a group of things, a product or a group of investments. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange. An ETF gives you the good things of a group investment and the good things of owning one stock. You can sell more stock than you own, buy some stock with money you borrow, and buy just one share at a time.\n\nETFs have many benefits. Their costs are lower than the costs of most mutual funds. But there are some bad points too. You have to pay a small fee for every trade like you do for a stock. There are also many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nIt is a good idea to check if the benefits an ETF says it has are true. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 investments. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning a group of the 10 stocks. We also want to see if we can find a better way to invest in the same stocks.\n\nTo make it easier, we will only look at the top 10 investments that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 investments and their percentage of the total.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a math formula. We will use the current percentage of assets to calculate how much each stock adds to a portfolio's risk and return if the portfolio was made up of only these 10 stocks. The calculations are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks makes 6.11% more money than the ETF. It also has a risk level that is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks might make more money with less risk. But we need to be sure that these results are real and not just chance.\n\nTo do this, we will look at how much each of the top 10 stocks can move up or down. We will then compare these numbers to the ETF's risk level. If the results are different, we can say that the ETF and the portfolio of 10 stocks are not the same.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his famous works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" twice. This word comes from the Roman poet Virgil. He used it to describe an island north of Britain. Many people think the Romans used the word to show the edge of the world.\n\nPoe liked the work of German writers. He was very interested in their writing. This is why we think he was influenced by the German writer Goethe. \n\nGoethe was a famous writer. He wrote a play called \"Faust\" in two parts. The first part was published in 1808 and the second part was published in 1832, the year he died. In \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king who loses his wife. He then drinks a lot and cries because he misses his wife. He decides it is time to die and gives away all his things. He throws a goblet into the sea and dies.\n\nPoe also wrote about Thule in another poem called \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He used the word \"ultma Thule\" in this poem. In \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the word \"Thulé\" at the beginning and end of the poem. This is interesting because \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely place. He sees a world with no color and is haunted by his dead friends. These scenes are very similar to \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nGoethe was a famous writer who Poe would have known. Poe liked the work of Alfred Tennyson, and Goethe was also well-known to Tennyson. Poe was exposed to Goethe's work when he read many reproductions of his writing.",
            "California law says a customer who gets hurt from slipping on a spill in a store can get extra money if the store manager knew about the spill but did nothing to clean it up. \n\nA customer named Jennifer Palmer was hurt after slipping on applesauce in a store called D&D Markets. She wants to prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted on purpose to harm her. To win, Palmer must show that Martin knew about the danger and ignored it. \n\nMartin was told about the spill twice, but he said he was busy eating dinner. Palmer can argue that Martin knew about the danger because many other customers were hurt from slipping in the store before she got hurt. She will say that Martin did not take care of the safety of his store.\n\nPalmer's claim that Martin acted on purpose to harm her is not very strong, but it is possible. Six customers slipped and fell in the store in one year, and Martin did not take action to fix the problem.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, Martin was told about the spill twice. He said he was too busy to deal with it. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt. Before she got hurt, five other customers slipped and fell in the store.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if they can prove that someone acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice\". Malice means acting on purpose to harm someone. If the person did not act on purpose, their behavior must be very bad and they must have been aware of the danger and ignored it.\n\nA court case from many years ago said that someone acts with malice when they ignore the danger and know that it will harm someone. In this case, Martin knew about the danger and ignored it, so a judge may not dismiss Palmer's claim for extra money.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One of the main topics we discussed was whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now this question is even more important than before.  After 9/11, I saw a big change in how the media viewed Islam.  It went from being very critical to being very accepting.  I think it would have been hard for someone like Barack Obama to run for president in 2001.  He has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nI am interested in the Biography of the Prophet.  What I know of the biography does not match the history of Muhammad.  I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam.  But the biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to see him because they believed in his teachings.  I also see some similarities between the life of Jesus and the stories of Muhammad.  One story is about Muhammad multiplying food and drink for many people.  This makes me think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a kind and special person.  This is not fair to Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography about people converting to Islam.  But most of the stories come from other people, not from the people who converted.  This makes me doubt the stories.  The writers also try to make Muhammad seem like a kind and wise man.  But history says he was not kind and humble.  I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's early teachings and beliefs are not the same today.  If we look at history, we see that Christianity moved away from its beginnings after Jesus died.  Today, people are becoming more aware and understanding of the past.  They are looking deeper into the true meaning of Christianity.  This will lead to a change in the way people think about their faith.  In the future, many Christians will look back at the teachings added to the religion and compare them to Jesus' original message.  This process will take time, but it is sure to happen.  One day, people will return to Jesus' ideas and throw away the extra teachings that were added over time.  The church will remain strong and lead the way.\n\nThis change will make Christianity more alike everywhere.  People will look and believe in the same way.  This is similar to other events in history.  For example, the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, but later it became Christian.  Our country once had slavery, but now an African-American can be president.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the beginning and understand Jesus' true message.  This will happen because people will learn to understand Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact statements.\n\nSo, what happened to Jesus' teachings?  If we look back in time, we see that the Jewish people were the first to believe in one God.  They believed in a divinely given message and the importance of the Hebrew scriptures.  Before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in sixty-three B.C.E., the Jewish people were divided into different groups.  These groups were the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many ordinary people.",
            "The book \"The Jungle\" shows how people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want to make their lives better. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One way is with the owners and managers of big factories. They only want to make their factories bigger and better. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way. They do not care if their pollution hurts people or animals.\n\nThe author of the book, Upton Sinclair, says that the factories are making a lot of pollution. This is bad for people and the Earth. The factories are also very dirty. The author says that the owners do not care about the people who work for them. They want to make money, and they do not care about their workers' well-being.\n\nThe workers are treated very badly. They have to work long hours, and they are not paid well. The owners can lay them off at any time without giving them help finding a new job. In the past, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant that the owners could do what they wanted. The workers were like slaves. They were very poor and had no way to get help.\n\nThe author says that this is not right. He says that workers should be treated fairly and given help when they need it. The book shows how people can be treated unfairly and how they can be forced to live in bad conditions.",
            "Many writers use special techniques to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. Some of these methods are better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. \n\nFitzgerald pairs words together in new ways to give a special feeling about a subject. He also uses symbols to mean something, and then uses them again to remind readers of that feeling. Fitzgerald uses this method with many colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. He builds up a meaning for these colors, and then uses that meaning to create a special feeling about a subject.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to mean the same thing - uniformity. He thinks white is better and more upper class, while gray is old and faded. He starts to use these colors at the beginning of the novel. Many people wear white: Daisy and Jordan always wear white, Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party, and Tom wears a white shirt. Only when Nick is not with the wealthy people is the color white not used.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. He says the streets of New York are like white chasms, the names of people at Gatsby's party are gray, and Catherine's apartment is just one small part of a long row of white buildings. He uses white and gray to describe regular people or places. \n\nAfter Fitzgerald uses these colors enough times, he starts to use them to show readers that something is unimportant or boring. He starts with Daisy. He describes her as wearing white and gray clothes, and readers start to see her as just a regular person, not a special one. Fitzgerald uses this method again to make readers see Daisy as less important. \n\nFitzgerald also describes Daisy's fur as gray, and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's meeting. He uses these colors again to show readers that Daisy is not special, just a regular person.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The weather is warm and sunny. Many crops grow well here. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a big market for food from local farms. Many people want to buy organic food. This means the food is grown without chemicals. There are many groups in San Diego that support this kind of farming. These groups have long waiting lists.\n\nSome farms also offer tours. People can visit the farms to see how the food is grown. They can also walk or hike in the area. This is fun for people who like the outdoors.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps animals and plants. The soil and water are cleaner. However, organic farming can be more expensive. It requires more work to remove pests and weeds. The farmer must also add natural fertilizer to the soil.\n\nThe land in this example is near the town of Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The land is next to a national forest. The area has many plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are becoming less common, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land was once home to Native Americans. Later, people raised cattle and sold wood here. The land was part of a farm a long time ago.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a real estate website. I looked at government programs to see how a small farmer could save money and help the environment. I also found an organic farm in the same area as an example of what might be done with this land.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. Culture is not one thing. It can be different in different ways and not the same everywhere. We often make general statements about cultures, like \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating.\" But these statements are too broad and not true for everyone in a country. Instead of making general statements, it is better to understand what a culture means in a situation and how it can affect talks at the negotiating table. \n\nWhen we meet a foreign culture, we see it in a way that is like our own culture, so we make comparisons. To understand a foreign culture, we can learn about its history or its problems. We should not judge or try to change a culture. We should accept it and work within its limits, especially in a negotiation. If we are in a weaker position, showing respect for traditions and values can help us get past cultural differences and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just between countries. Companies have their own cultures too. A company's culture can be seen in how its employees dress, communicate, or do their jobs. Some companies value hard work and long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. If we look at American companies, we can see how different they can be from each other. Even within a company, there can be different cultures in different parts of the country or in different cities.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because they show us why a culture does things. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not publicly criticize their company or boss. If a culture values making a hard bargain, a negotiator will not settle too quickly. Knowing these things can help us negotiate more effectively. We should also try to learn about our opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation successful.",
            "\"The fool says, 'There is no God.' This idea is found in the Bible. We will look at two arguments for God's existence. Both come from St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. We will compare their ideas.\n\nWe will start with the idea that they both believe in the same God. If we do not, we cannot compare their ideas. We will assume they are talking about the same God.\n\nSt. Anselm says we can know God exists in our minds. He says we cannot think of a God who does not exist. This means we do not need evidence outside of our minds to understand God. He says we can find truth about God inside ourselves.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God's existence with reason and evidence. We do not need faith to understand God. He presents five ideas to support God's existence: change, cause, chance, goodness, and harmony. He says we can know God's existence by thinking about these ideas.\n\nWe will look at these ideas to see if one is better than the other.\"",
            "Long, long ago, a prince was born. He would one day be known as Buddha. This happened in the 500s BC. The prince gave up his life of luxury and became a holy man. He was very wise and his teachings started the religion of Buddhism. There are many kinds of Buddhism, but the most traditional kind is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It has changed over time. You can see this in Sri Lanka, a country with many Theravada Buddhists. There, people celebrate the water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and ordinary people participate in this ceremony. It has some meaning, but Buddha never taught about it.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened for many reasons. Some changes came from inside the community. Some came from people outside the community. Some of these changes were good, and some were bad.\n\nThere are some important terms to understand. An internal force is a change that comes from people inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a change that comes from people outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is a change that hurts the Buddhist community. A benign force is a change that does not mean to harm the Buddhist community. These terms will be used often in this discussion.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of the Tripitaka, a collection of Buddhist books. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, which are Buddhist teachings. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the nature of reality. These ideas include Anatta (there is no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything is impermanent). When people understand these ideas, they can end the cycle of death and rebirth. They can also end lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). This happens when they become enlightened.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. For ordinary people, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have bad sex, and do not take drugs. For monks and nuns, there are many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, desire causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once rivals for 57 years. This rivalry lasted from 1836 to 1893. One of the biggest fights between the two countries was the Mexican-American War. The United States won this war in 1846-1848. It got Texas and the American Southwest as new land. Many other fights happened between the two nations. These fights stopped just before World War One.\n\nThe two countries had disagreements on many things, including religion and culture. They also had different interests. This is true for many countries that share a border. They often have disagreements that make their relationship difficult.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are like other countries that have been rivals with a neighbor. David M. Pletcher said, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba did the United States have long-lasting problems.\" These countries are close to the United States and have been rivals. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a problem between the two countries. Many countries have had disagreement about religion in the past. One expert said, \"If Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries.\"\n\nThese two countries had a distrust of each other. This distrust came from the English and Spanish. They were the colonial rulers of the area. This made it hard for the United States and Mexico to be friends.\n\nThe two countries had 17 disagreements during the 57 years of rivalry. Most of these disagreements were about land. The United States and Mexico had problems with bandits and outlaws on their border. They had to use the military to stop these problems.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries began to end when Mexico needed the United States for help. Later, the United States changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick with an illness I did not know I had. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job for safety and security. People told me that finding work would always be easy because people are always sick. So, I chose nursing instead of being a scientist or journalist.\n\nBut I was 46 years old, single, and had no money. I could not work. I am still sick, and I have been living on disability money for 15 years. I have nothing left that is mine. Every day is hard and makes me feel less safe and less good about myself. I know one thing is true: I would not have made it without the help of my family and friends. They are very kind to me.\n\nI know that bad things happen in life. Some things are too hard to handle by ourselves. We should not depend on the government to help us in hard times. But we should help each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nSome Americans say we should be independent and strong like our ancestors. But our ancestors did not make it alone. They helped each other and shared what they had.\n\nSo, be prepared for emergencies. I have a kit with supplies and a plan. I have food, water, and tools. If you can, grow your own food and be ready for hard times. But also know your neighbors and ask for help when you need it.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? \n\nA long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that biologists have not yet found a way to explain even simple shapes in scientific language. Today, we still have not solved this problem. However, we are trying to use math to understand how animals develop and change over time.\n\nWe are studying a type of animal called Prunum. We want to know how its shell develops and changes over time. We used pictures of the animals to measure the shell's shape and size. We put this information into a computer program to create new, possible shell shapes. These shapes can help us understand how the shell can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It turns around in a circle, making a spiral shape. This spiral shape is called a whorl. The center of the shell is called the columella. The shell grows in size and makes new whorls over time. Each new whorl is separated from the old one by a line called a suture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, or from the front. When we look at a shell from the front, we see the opening of the shell, called the aperture.\n\nWe can count the number of whorls on a shell by looking at it from the top. We draw a line on the shell and count the whorls from that line. We can also look at the path of the opening of the shell as the animal grows. We can use math to describe this path and change the shape of the shell.\n\nBy using math to describe how the shell grows, we can change the shape of the shell and understand how it developed. This can help us understand how animals change over time and how they evolve.",
            "Indonesia's health system has a problem. Many babies and young children are dying. This is not getting better. Indonesia wants to meet some of the United Nations' goals by 2015. But it is not making progress in health for babies and mothers.\n\nThe number of births where a skilled health worker is present has increased. Now 72% of births have a skilled worker. But many of these workers are not doctors or nurses. They are midwives who cannot help in emergency situations. This means many mothers are still dying from bleeding.\n\nFewer children are getting medical help for diarrhea. And not enough mothers are getting help after giving birth. This is a big problem.\n\nDoctors are not performing enough operations on pregnant women. Only 4% of women have cesarean sections. But in cities, 7% of women have this operation. In the countryside, it is only 2%. This shows that rich people can get health care, but poor people cannot.\n\nThe poor have a hard time getting health care. They have to pay out of their own money. This makes it hard for them to get the help they need.\n\nThe question is how to make the health system better. Should Indonesia make special programs for babies and mothers, or should it make the whole health system stronger? Making special programs can help, but it can also cause problems. It can take money away from other areas of health care. And it can make it hard to coordinate services.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the aristocracy.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels use mystery and strange situations to make the characters more interesting. This makes it easier for readers to understand their feelings and motives.\n\nA famous example is from the book Oliver Twist. The main character, Oliver, is confused and scared. He hears voices in his head and sees strange things. He is trying to understand what is happening to him. Oliver is talking to two men, Sikes and Crackit, but they are not real. He is still thinking about them even when he is in a different place. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise and sees lights. He is taken away quickly.\n\nIn these strange situations, Oliver learns more about himself and the world around him. He finds out about the true nature of things and what is happening to him. Oliver's health is getting worse, and he is having trouble controlling what is happening to him. He is scared and in pain. He does not have control over his life, and this makes him feel defeated.\n\nThe same thing happens in Wuthering Heights. The author uses strange and dreamlike situations to make the characters more interesting and to show their feelings and motives. The two novels are different from other Victorian novels because they use mystery and strange situations in a different way.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students with their school work, but my strengths were in English and reading. I helped a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. He spoke perfect English, but he had a problem with some letters. This was strange. His mother did not speak English. She spoke Spanish. We used my little Spanish to talk. I understood then that Adrian had trouble with the English alphabet. He could read, but he did not know the alphabet well.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language barrier can be a big problem in school. Even if a student speaks perfect English, reading can still be hard. I think we all agree that this is a problem. What can we do? For Adrian, I helped him with English reading. But for other students who do not speak much English, it is more complicated. There is no simple answer. We need to use many solutions together.\n\nOne good idea is a dual language system. This means teaching in two languages, like English and Spanish. This can help all students, not just those who speak Spanish at home. Studies show that students in two-way bilingual programs do better in school. Some people are afraid that this system will waste money and will not help most students. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all students will benefit.\n\nSo, how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. These helpers can work with teachers to help students who need it. This can help students who do not speak much English.",

            "The Gothic Novel: A New Old Thing\n\nThe Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" (Watt) Some people do not like it because it does not have deep meaning. Others praise it for its powerful and exciting qualities. The first Gothic Novel was Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. It used ideas from old romances and modern novels to create a new kind of story. Walpole mixed old and new things to create something new.\n\nThe Gothic Novel uses old ideas from the Middle Ages, like theater, architecture, and traditions. People thought the word \"Gothic\" was old-fashioned. They thought it was not as good as modern ideas. The Gothic Novel combines old and new things in a way that makes it interesting and new for a long time. This is why it has lasted so long.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a knight to be brave, honest, and good. The Gothic writers liked this idea because they thought it was missing in their society. They used chivalric ideas to make the past seem better than the present. This was especially true for Horace Walpole, who was writing about a time of trouble. He was unhappy with the way people were behaving. In his Novel, The Castle of Otranto, he created a character named Frederic. Frederic is a good example of a chivalric knight. He is a prince, he has been hurt by bad things, and he is supposed to be a brave and honest man.",
            "Supply chain management is a process that gets goods from customers to products. It includes planning and controlling the flow of goods from raw materials to customers. The term \"supply chain management\" was first used by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers. \n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production. Production is the base of the supply chain. It decides when, why, where, and how things are made. To know what customers want, managers look at the market. The market tells managers what customers need. \n\nManagers decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products. They choose a place that can make the products in big numbers and with good quality. They must remember to make sure customers are happy. \n\nThe next step is to plan work and take care of equipment. Production is very important in the supply chain. If every step is not planned, it can cost a company a lot of time and money. \n\nThe second key part of the supply chain is supply. Supply is making good decisions about a company's ability and partnerships. Managers decide which parts of the company can do each job best. They might also send some work to other companies to make things faster and cheaper. This is called outsourcing. It helps a company be flexible and provide good quality at a low cost.\n\nIn my past job at Wal-Mart and Target, we had printed books and clear processes for every part of the business. This kept everything running smoothly and helped us know what to do. Having a plan helps a company work well and avoid mistakes.",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia ruled by a bad government. The government took power in 1962 by force. In 2007, people began to protest. These were the first public protests in ten years. The protests were led by many monks. They wore yellow robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution. \n\nAt first, the government let the monks have peaceful meetings. But soon, the government became violent. They attacked the monks and the monasteries in the country. They arrested foreign journalists and killed one. A Japanese journalist was killed on September 27th, 2007. He was only there to take pictures of the protest. Many people were killed, but the government only said 13 died. \n\nThis is not new. Governments have been trying to control their people for a long time. In ancient Rome, the emperors thought they were gods. In Japan, the emperors were believed to be gods too. They said they came to Earth to make people's lives better. Our current president had a bad friend, Ted Haggard. He led a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere have been many bad examples like this. In 1989, many people protested against the Chinese government in Tiananmen Square. The government said 200-300 people died, but other groups said 2,000-3,000 people died. In the 1990s, people in Rwanda were killed because of their ethnic group. This was called a genocide. The Nazis, led by Hitler, also killed many people who were Jewish. This happened in several countries over many years.",
            "Duke Ellington had a great influence on jazz. He lived a long life and had many years to make music. This helped him create many new and interesting pieces. In some of his music, you do not hear him play the piano much. But when he did play, it was usually to help the other musicians. \n\nEllington was very good at writing music that showed off what each musician could do. He gave them room to play freely and make up their own music. He also wrote music with many parts that worked together well. This made the orchestra sound new and original.\n\nEllington knew how to make each musician sound good on their own. He also knew how to make them sound good together. This helped him write some of the most creative and excellent music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's music. It says he used the human voice as a special instrument. This was something new and exciting in his time. He did this in many of his songs. \n\nOne of Ellington's early songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example. In this song, the voice is used in a special way. It adds texture and color to the music without using lyrics. This was a new idea at the time.\n\nCreole Love Call is a slow and bluesy song with six parts. Here is what happens in each part:\n\nPart 1: The voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other in a special way.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a long and slow solo.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and high solo with a piano that plays in a special way.\nPart 4: The whole band plays the first part again with the brass and woodwind sections talking to each other.\nPart 5: The woodwind sections play a fast and high call and response, with the brass and rhythm sections playing in a special way.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, but the voice sounds different. It sounds like it is growling like an animal.\n\nThe song ends with a short part that has a high-pitched sound and a strange finish by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add color to his music is a special thing that he did in many of his songs.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music to make it sound good. He uses a trumpet player and a singer to create a special sound. The singer is not singing words, but using sounds like an instrument. \n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to make the music sound interesting. The trombone player plays a special sound that makes the song sound exciting.",

The study showed that eating a diet like this can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe Mediterranean Diet is a special way of eating. It includes a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables. It also includes fish and small amounts of alcohol. The study used a special score to measure how closely people followed this diet.\n\nPrevious studies showed that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be good for you.

They were asked about the foods they ate and how often they ate them. More than 95% of the women kept participating in the study throughout the 20 years.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a Mediterranean Diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They also had a lower risk of dying from heart disease or stroke. The study controlled for other factors that could affect the results, like smoking and physical activity.\n\nThe study showed that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be very good for you.

            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market fell down. Many big companies went out of business. This problem still exists today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The problem started because some people in government made bad decisions. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake because the banks did not have enough money to lend. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two important companies, bought these bad loans and sold them to others. \n\nThis was a bad idea. When people could not pay back their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold these bad loans to others, and the problem spread to the whole economy. \n\nThe problem started in 1999. The President at the time, Bill Clinton, wanted to be elected again. He wanted to make people happy, so he changed the rules for lending money. This made it easy to give loans to people who could not pay them back. A news reporter named Steven Holmes wrote in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae is giving loans to people who cannot pay them back.\" He said this could cause big problems if there was a crisis. \n\nMany things combined to make the problem worse. New kinds of loans, like adjustable-rate mortgages, were used. These loans are not good because they can increase the amount of money people owe. Many people in the United States borrowed too much money and bought too many houses. This made the economy very weak. When the housing market fell, many people could not pay their loans. The banks were in trouble. The top five big banks in the United States had a combined debt of $4.1 trillion dollars. This was a big problem. Two banks, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold very cheap. Another bank, Lehman Brothers, went out of business. Some other banks, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had to become commercial banks and follow strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in debt and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Many writers struggle with exposition.  This is the part of a story where you explain too much.  This can be boring for readers.\n\nYou already know the writing tip, \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes.  She writes long parts with no action.  This is not what you want.\n\nExposition is like a devil on your shoulder.  It says, \"Get this information out of the way so you can get to the good parts.\"\n\nExposition is when you tell the reader what happened.  In a movie, this is like one character talking too much.  In a story, the writer is doing the telling.\n\nA good example is when you read a story and learn about the main character's husband.  You learn that he is a good person and that she loves him very much.  But this does not happen in one or two lines of dialogue.  The writer wants you to like the husband and feel sad when he dies.\n\nSo, the writer should show you how much the main character loves her husband.  This can be through what she says and does.  This way, you can feel sad with her when he dies.  You will also learn more about her character.\n\nIn short, you want meat on the bone of the story.  You want to learn about the characters and feel what they feel.\n\nAs a writer, you need to give your reader that meat.  You should not rush through parts of the story.  You should make the reader want to keep reading.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first program was \"live\" from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They talked about this story for about two minutes because it was still happening.\n\nThe second story was about a young man, 18 years old, named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was very badly hurt. The police had not found anyone to arrest yet. They were investigating. This story was short, but I think it was because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed that when a black person is a victim of a crime, the news does not talk about it as much. If a white person is a victim, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. They talked about where the helicopter crashed and what kind of bullet hit it. They were asking for help to catch the person who did it. They offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said there would be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid-eighties for the weekend.\n\nThey also talked about a store robbery on Clime Road. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. They talked about his skin color a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was convicted of selling a lot of marijuana to people in Ohio from Texas. I noticed they talked about how long he was sentenced to prison, thirty years, instead of saying three hundred months. I don't know why they said it that way. They also said he was Hispanic, but that was not important to the story.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and hard to break. It includes many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and hurt. Brothers understand each other in a special way. They can see themselves in their brother. In hard times, the true nature of this connection becomes clear. It can be good or bad. The feelings that come from this connection can be very strong. They can also have serious consequences. When one brother sees his brother, he sees himself. He sees the good and the bad. This is where a brother's true character is shown. \n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers show this connection. They have very strong emotions that make them act in different ways. They go on a journey that ends badly. Pride and disappointment mix together in a big way. Only one brother survives. The story shows how the brothers feel about each other. It also shows how their feelings affect their actions.\n\nThe older brother's feelings are very important. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants someone to play with and have fun with. But his little brother, Doodle, is very sick. He can't do the things the older brother wants him to do. This makes the older brother sad and angry. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles at him, he feels happy. This shows that the older brother loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about how brothers feel about each other. It shows how their feelings can be good or bad. It also shows how these feelings can affect their actions.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that processes information. As technology has changed, people have used different ways to describe the brain. Early people compared it to a flat piece of wax, then to a piece of paper, and now to a computer. These comparisons are helpful, but they have limits.\n\nThe brain takes in information from the senses. These include touch, heat, sound, and light. The brain changes this information into electrical signals. It does this again and again in two processes: bottom-up and top-down.\n\nImagine looking at a picture of a black box. Bottom-up processing puts together simple information like color and shape. It helps you see the box. Top-down processing uses this information to help you identify the box. It helps you understand what it is.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what to focus on. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain does not notice individual blades of grass. But it can hear your name even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information and uses it again later. There are three kinds of memory: short-term, working memory, and long-term. Information is first encoded, or put into the brain. There are different ways to encode different kinds of information. For example, written words can be encoded based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean.\n\nThe brain keeps information in different ways. Working memory holds information for a short time, about 20 seconds. Long-term memory is stored in the structure of special kinds of proteins.\n\nScientists have many different ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some are based on how people remember things, others on how computers work, and others on how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected nodes, or points. Each node represents a concept, and they are connected based on how they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wood.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in his book Brave New World. He criticizes the way people will live under a system controlled by technology and capitalism. The people in the book value being with friends above being an individual. They are taught from a young age to be happy now, not to think about the future. The citizens are like pawns in a game. They must do what the World Controller says. By looking at the book from a Marxist point of view, we can see that Huxley did not like the way capitalism was growing at that time.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism by showing how people are not free to make their own choices. They are forced to buy things they do not need and to work hard to get more things. The people in the book, like the Delta and Gamma classes, do not have the power to make choices. They are controlled by the World Controller. He makes them want to buy and use things. This is like the idea of false consciousness in Marxism. The people do not know how the system works, and they are not free.\n\nThe people in the book do not have real relationships with each other. They are not allowed to feel deep emotions like love or happiness. They only care about how they look and what they have. The way people interact with each other in the book shows that they are not free to be themselves. They are like robots, doing what they are told.\n\nThe people in the book are happy to be in their place in society. They do not want to change. This is like the idea of the proletariat in Marxism. The people are controlled by the system, and they are happy to be controlled. They are not aware of how the system works, and they do not want to know.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be difficult. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, which is on the far side of campus. Going to classes in buildings like Willard, near the center, took 25 minutes on foot. The weather was often bad, so it took even longer. I talked to a graduate who said that not long ago, East Halls was far from other buildings. Now it is surrounded by sports fields, new buildings, and apartments.\n\nAs campus grows, getting around becomes harder. One good solution is a bicycle. But students need to ride them and the campus needs to be good for bicyclists. My friend recently started riding again. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the only way to get around.\" Bicycling is also good for your body. It's the best way to travel on campus. I live off campus, near Thomas building. My bike takes me there in 5 minutes. The road to Thomas is not always easy to ride on. Walking is also good, but I am too busy. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk, which would take 30-40 minutes. That is 2 1/2 hours a week. I don't have that much time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I want to study social work to help children who have been hurt or neglected. I also want to help families in trouble. I believe in three important values: serving others, showing respect, and acting honestly. These values are important for all social workers, and they are also important to me.\n\nI have always wanted to help others, but I did not know what job I wanted to do. While I was in high school and college, I saw many people ignoring their problems. Some people used bad ways to deal with their problems. Because of what I saw, I decided to study psychology. I still did not know what job I wanted, so I took a break after I finished college. One summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was very nervous. He was there because his parents were being mean to him. I called the police and told them I had studied psychology in college. They asked me to talk to the parents. When I asked them about the boy, they seemed nervous and made excuses. After that, I decided to study social work to help children like the boy.\n\nAnother important value is fairness. We say that every person is important, but we do not always act that way. We say we value individuality, but we often do what others do. I do not like to do what others do. I like to be myself. In high school and college, I stood up against unfairness whenever I could. I wore clothes that were not like what others wore. I protested against racism and unfairness when I saw it. I believe in fairness, and I will continue to stand up for what I believe in.",
            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model focuses on genetic information and medical health issues. The Sociocultural model looks at how environment and social factors affect sleep. This review will examine research on these models and explain each study. We will look at the strengths and weaknesses of each study to better understand the models.\n\nThere are different types of sleep disorders. Some are primary sleep disorders. Others are related to mental or medical problems. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Sleep disorders related to a mental disorder are linked to a major mental illness. Other sleep disorders are caused by medical problems or a person's behavior.\n\nDyssonmias are sleep disorders that affect how we sleep. Some Dyssonmias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia is a problem with sleeping too little. Primary Hypersomnia is a problem with sleeping too much. Narcolepsy causes people to fall asleep suddenly. Dyssonmias are about falling asleep and staying asleep.\n\nParasomnias are sleep disorders that cause behavioral problems or physical reactions. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to a mental illness are linked to an Axis I (serious mental illness) or Axis II (personality disorder or mental disability) disorder.\n\nThis review will focus on insomnia and primary sleep disorders. It will look at the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders looks at genetic factors, hereditary traits, and physical aspects of sleep. A study on mice found that neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin control sleep and wakefulness. The study found that mice with a specific receptor on these neurons had problems with sleep and wake states. Researchers found that a chemical (baclofen) that activated the receptor helped mice sleep. This study suggests that there may be a genetic and environmental basis for sleep problems in humans. This could affect a person's ability to sleep without medicine.\n\nThe Sociocultural implication of this study is that if the receptor is inherited, it could affect a person's sleep. This could impact daily life, such as school, work, or other tasks that require concentration.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, we explain what the disorder is. Next, we explain how to diagnose it. Finally, we talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem where the brain does not work correctly with sounds. People with CAPD can hear normally. They do not have a hearing problem. But their brain cannot separate sounds or understand speech in noisy places. This is not the same as being deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nThe study of CAPD began in the 1950s. Researchers were trying to understand children with speech and hearing problems. They made tests to help them. A doctor named Kimura created a way to test how the brain works with sounds in the 1960s.\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble hearing where sounds come from. They may have trouble telling two sounds apart. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may have trouble understanding speech. They may not be able to hear one sound because of another sound. They may not be able to understand what sounds mean.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a doctor must test the person with CAPD. The doctor may use questionnaires, observe how the person behaves, or use special tests. These tests can check how the person hears and responds to sounds. There is no one test that works for everyone. But doctors use many different tests to try to understand what is happening.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom. First, the teacher should sit near the student. This way, the student can see the teacher's face and hear them more easily. The teacher should also avoid background noise. This can make it harder for the student to hear. The teacher should speak clearly and loudly, but not too loudly. The teacher should also give the student extra time to answer questions. This can help the student understand what is being said.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that using a disguise can help people trick others. But, it can also cause problems. If a person stays in disguise too long, they may lose their true self. Ending a deception can be hard because it may hurt relationships.\n\nThe play is especially interesting when it talks about people changing their gender. This raises many questions. Why do people want to disguise themselves as the opposite sex? In the play, a character named Viola wants to change her sex to protect herself. She is a woman who is alone in a new place. She decides to pretend to be a man so she can be safe.\n\nViola's plan works. But it also separates her from other women. She is good at acting like a man that others start to think she is really a man. Another character, Olivia, falls in love with Viola but does not know she is a woman. Viola also has feelings for a man named Orsino but is pretending to be a man so she cannot be honest about her feelings.\n\nThe play may show that people can use a disguise to discover hidden feelings. Two characters, Olivia and Orsino, may have feelings for each other that they do not express openly. When Viola appears as a man, they are forced to think about their feelings. But, it is not clear if Olivia really likes Viola or just likes the way Viola looks. The play may be saying that people make judgments based on how others look.\n\nThis is shown when Olivia quickly switches her love from Viola to Viola's twin brother, Sebastian. She starts to see Viola as a sister rather than a love interest. The play is saying that people may not be honest about their feelings and may judge others based on how they look.",
            "German rule in Africa was very bad. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. But German rule was not the same everywhere. Each colony had its own ideas and ways of doing things. Schools in the colonies were also different. When the British took control of German East Africa (now known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. Germans had also built good schools in Kamerun and other colonies.\n\nBut the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was different. In East Africa, the government built schools and helped teach the local people. In South West Africa, the government left most of the teaching to missionaries. The government did give some money to the missionaries, but not enough. The government, however, built many schools for Europeans living in the colony. They also controlled and supported the schools run by missionaries. This policy had a big effect on South West Africa even after German rule ended. Many Africans in South West Africa did not learn to read and write.\n\nOther German colonies had many educated and literate Africans. But in South West Africa, “most of the people were not educated, not literate.” Many things caused this difference. This paper wants to discuss these things and look at how the people who ruled the colony and the settlers felt about the local people.\n\nThere is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of these writings describe the schools in the colonies. Later writings compared the schools in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. These studies showed that the schools in each colony were different. One important study was done by Cohen. He compared the schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the large number of settlers in South West Africa helped create the differences in the education system there.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of it was desert. The number of European settlers in the colony was small compared to the population of East Africa. By 1913, about 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. Only 5,336 Europeans lived in East Africa.",
            "The music called Popular Music has grown over the past 100 years. It has many kinds. It is hard to list them all. Many kinds of music have smaller kinds. For example, the kind called Heavy Metal rock has many smaller kinds. Heavy Metal rock is expressive. It shows a wide range of feelings. It is mostly on the darker side. \n\nHeavy Metal rock is also very diverse. Many people started to make their own smaller kinds of Heavy Metal rock. This continued for many years. Today, there are many kinds of Heavy Metal music. It is hard to say what exactly Heavy Metal is. It has taken parts from other kinds of music. But it started from somewhere. To understand the kind of music we have today, we need to know what Heavy Metal is and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy Metal is a movement that is often about things that are dark. It is often loud and violent. It can be very theatrical. People who make Heavy Metal music are very good at their instruments. Heavy Metal music often comes from using strong drugs. There was a time when many people were using strong drugs. This led to music that was very strange and new. Many later kinds of Heavy Metal music took parts from the dark and exciting qualities of old music. Some songs, like Helter Skelter, show the darker side of music. This song is from the Beatles. It is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was made because the Beatles wanted to show that they could make music that was as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous artist. He painted many pictures. One of his most famous works is called The Dream. It was painted in 1910.\n\nThe Dream is more than just a picture of a woman in a dream. It shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be a great artist. He wanted people to like his work.\n\nRousseau had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by other artists. But he also wanted to be his own person. He wanted to paint in his own way, not like others. This made him very unhappy.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in a small town in France. His father was a worker. Rousseau had no special training in art. He worked as a toll collector. At home, he had a daughter and a lot of grief. He started painting to make himself happy.\n\nRousseau wanted to be like other artists. He saw them painting beautiful pictures. He wanted to be good too. But Rousseau's paintings were different. He painted simple things, like the world around him. He was a folk painter.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous. He wanted people to like his art. But it was hard. Many other artists were famous. They had been painting for a long time. Rousseau was older when he started. He didn't get famous until later.\n\nA man named Jan Gordon wrote about Rousseau and another artist named Matisse. Matisse was a good painter. He didn't want to paint like others. He wanted to be different. Rousseau wanted to be like everyone else. He wanted to be accepted.\n\nRousseau's story is an example of a person who wanted to be accepted by others. But he also wanted to be himself. It's a big problem to solve.",
            "Many great thinkers have suggested a strong connection between ethics and beauty. They believe that at a basic level, there is a reason for this connection. John Keats wrote in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we know in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to like ethics and beauty without being taught these things in school. Both ethics and beauty are attempts to describe, not tell us what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are attempts to explain why something is beautiful or why an action is right, rather than a set of rules.\n\nIn fact, we cannot fully understand what is good or beautiful by just talking about it. For example, a conversation about the Mona Lisa by da Vinci may talk about its background, foreground, and contrast. But these things do not explain why it is a good piece of art. When we like a work of art or literature, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" I think both art and morals cannot be fully explained. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" No matter how much we describe a work of literature, there is something more.\n\nI think ethics and art are similar because we experience both most strongly in a way that cannot be fully explained. This is true, especially for literature. As McKean said, \"Literature has a moral quality that is unique. It is connected to our values in life.\" We need values to live. Literature is important because it gives us values.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It has a unique culture that comes from many different groups and tribes. The culture can be seen in many parts of the country, from the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It can also be seen in Köln on the Rhine River, in the center of Germany, and in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany's culture is special because it has a long history. Many different groups lived in the area that is now Germany. The country's name, Germania, comes from the Germanic tribes. But where the name came from is not clear. Some historians think it came from a tribe known as the Tungrians. They were a group of people who lived in the area before they moved across the Rhine River and fought with the Gauls.\n\nJulius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the people he was fighting against. Caesar learned the word from the Gauls themselves. They used it to describe their neighbors. Caesar used the word to show the difference between the Gauls and the Germans.\n\nThe origin of the word \"German\" is not clear. Some people think it came from the spear that the Germanic tribes used in battle. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This might mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said that the Germans were a separate group of people who did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild and cold country, and they were not interested in leaving their homes to go to other places.\n\nFor a long time, the Romans did not conquer Germany. They did not want to live there. Instead, they would send soldiers to the area to get goods and to trade with the Germanic tribes. The Germanic tribes would often serve in the Roman army, and they would bring their skills back to their own homes.",
            "I stared down at the bowl in front of me. My mind was empty. I was not thinking about the picture in front of me. I was just looking at it.\n\nWhen I was a child, I wanted to learn how to draw. I bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches how to understand art. One way it teaches is to use a square frame around a picture. This helps you see the picture clearly.\n\nBut at that moment, I could not think about a frame. The bowl was too busy and complicated. I was amazed by it.\n\nI wanted to be an artist. Picasso liked blue, Monet liked green, and the Renaissance masters liked many colors. I thought the bowl could be my painting, my story, called \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nI picked up my pencil. My hand moved, and my mind made something new. Water was flowing, and things were moving away. But then my hand hit the toilet handle again. The brown package would not move. It was stuck.\n\nI was unhappy. I had a mop in my hand and a green tie around my neck. I looked at the dirty package and thought about the people who clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. I wanted to make it go away.\n\nI flushed the toilet again. Then I used toilet paper to fix my hand. I bent down to get the package. My hand went into the water like a mother cooking a turkey.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Several things make this a big problem for young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health say one reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers also do not have much experience. This lack of experience causes more accidents and makes them drive too fast or drive off the road.\n\nTeenagers also drive badly when they have friends in the car. A study in California found that when the young passenger is older, there are more car accidents.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teens by requiring temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and say they cannot have other young people in the car.\n\nBut some people think that is not enough. They say teens are not ready to drive safely. A psychologist says that even 18 is too young to drive. He says young people like to take risks for fun. This means we should wait until they are older before they can drive. If we let young teens drive, many more people will be hurt or killed.\n\nWe can make a law to solve this problem. Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can drive a car. A special permit can still be given before a full license, and young drivers must practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours. This way, we can protect young drivers across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a way to keep young people safe.",
            "I looked through the Library of Congress's library of early Edison films. I decided to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make illusions. My study of the films focused on the way they were made and looked at the differences between most of the films and a few that were different.\n\nMost of the trick films from the time period are made in a box on a stage. The camera does not move to follow people or objects. This way of making films came from the theater and magic shows. It has some limitations. For example, people in the films can only move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera.\n\nIn the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors enter from one side and move back and forth. Even when they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\n\nMost of the trick films from Edison are long shots. Sometimes they are medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because of the way the films were made for the stage and theater. The actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are not needed.\n\nMost of the early trick films are short. They are about one minute long. They are often short tricks, like magic and disappearing acts. However, some of the trick films are made by joining several shots together to make an illusion. If you look closely at the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), you can see where the shots are joined.",
            "John Taylor was a strong supporter of Republicanism. He was a farmer, and his work and short time in politics made him known for his strong ideas about freedom and government. He believed a farm-based system was the best way to live. This idea influenced his thoughts on the government, its power, and the courts.\n\nTaylor thought the United States had a special chance to create a perfect system. There was no old tradition to follow, so the country's leaders could create a system where people could govern themselves. He believed in the natural rights of people. He thought that if one of these rights is taken away, all the rights are weakened. He believed government should not control these rights. He said that in a natural state, those with physical power and bad intentions often succeed. But in a civilized society, this should not be true.\n\nTo create a good society, Taylor thought the government must consider both good and evil in people. He believed in a simple good and evil view of the world. He said government is like people. It has good and bad qualities. He wanted a government that protects private property and helps farmers. He believed a good government would work well even if its leaders are not good. He thought self-interest is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it hurts others. A good government must keep people's natural evil in check.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that follows the Constitution exactly. He wanted a small federal government with only the powers listed in the Constitution. He thought a big government is expensive and might be unfair. He believed a simple interpretation of the Constitution can be bad if it ignores the writers' intentions. He thought the Declaration of Independence is the real charter of the United States because it says the country is a group of states, not one country.",
            "A Look at the Commuter Log Project\n\nThere was a big drop in the number of people who used the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a problem. It is hard to say why this happened. One reason may be the winter weather in New England. Fewer people use their bikes or walk to school when it is cold outside. \n\nAnother reason is that it was the end of the fall semester. Students were busy with schoolwork and final exams. They may have forgotten to use the log. December is also the start of the holiday season. Many students and faculty members do not need to be on campus during this time. When classes started again in January, the number of log submissions did not go up. This was a surprise.\n\nSome people think that any big project will have a lot of energy at the start, but then the interest will decrease. We tried to stop this from happening by creating the Carpool Challenge Week. This was a special event in March to encourage people to use the log again. It helped to increase the number of submissions for that month.\n\nAnother problem with the project was that many people like to drive their cars. This is a part of our culture. We tried to make alternative forms of transportation more attractive by giving out prizes. People could win gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We thought this would make them want to use the log. We gave out these prizes for the whole project. \n\nWe thought it would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a new bike or a new car. This might have made more people participate. The prizes we gave did not change throughout the project. If the prizes had increased in value, it might have helped to keep people interested.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security. It is designed to follow a group of things, a product or a group of investments. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on a stock exchange. An ETF gives you the good things of a group investment and the good things of owning one stock. You can sell more stock than you own, buy some stock with money you borrow, and buy just one share at a time.\n\nETFs have many benefits. Their costs are lower than the costs of most mutual funds. But there are some bad points too. You have to pay a small fee for every trade like you do for a stock. There are also many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nIt is a good idea to check if the benefits an ETF says it has are true. We will look at the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 investments. We want to see if owning one ETF is as good as owning a group of the 10 stocks. We also want to see if we can find a better way to invest in the same stocks.\n\nTo make it easier, we will only look at the top 10 investments that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 investments and their percentage of the total.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can use a math formula. We will use the current percentage of assets to calculate how much each stock adds to a portfolio's risk and return if the portfolio was made up of only these 10 stocks. The calculations are in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, we can see that a portfolio with only the top 10 stocks makes 6.11% more money than the ETF. It also has a risk level that is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks might make more money with less risk. But we need to be sure that these results are real and not just chance.\n\nTo do this, we will look at how much each of the top 10 stocks can move up or down. We will then compare these numbers to the ETF's risk level. If the results are different, we can say that the ETF and the portfolio of 10 stocks are not the same.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his famous works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" twice. This word comes from the Roman poet Virgil. He used it to describe an island north of Britain. Many people think the Romans used the word to show the edge of the world.\n\nPoe liked the work of German writers. He was very interested in their writing. This is why we think he was influenced by the German writer Goethe. \n\nGoethe was a famous writer. He wrote a play called \"Faust\" in two parts. The first part was published in 1808 and the second part was published in 1832, the year he died. In \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king who loses his wife. He then drinks a lot and cries because he misses his wife. He decides it is time to die and gives away all his things. He throws a goblet into the sea and dies.\n\nPoe also wrote about Thule in another poem called \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" He used the word \"ultma Thule\" in this poem. In \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the word \"Thulé\" at the beginning and end of the poem. This is interesting because \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are like companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely place. He sees a world with no color and is haunted by his dead friends. These scenes are very similar to \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nGoethe was a famous writer who Poe would have known. Poe liked the work of Alfred Tennyson, and Goethe was also well-known to Tennyson. Poe was exposed to Goethe's work when he read many reproductions of his writing.",
            "California law says a customer who gets hurt from slipping on a spill in a store can get extra money if the store manager knew about the spill but did nothing to clean it up. \n\nA customer named Jennifer Palmer was hurt after slipping on applesauce in a store called D&D Markets. She wants to prove that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted on purpose to harm her. To win, Palmer must show that Martin knew about the danger and ignored it. \n\nMartin was told about the spill twice, but he said he was busy eating dinner. Palmer can argue that Martin knew about the danger because many other customers were hurt from slipping in the store before she got hurt. She will say that Martin did not take care of the safety of his store.\n\nPalmer's claim that Martin acted on purpose to harm her is not very strong, but it is possible. Six customers slipped and fell in the store in one year, and Martin did not take action to fix the problem.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, Martin was told about the spill twice. He said he was too busy to deal with it. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt. Before she got hurt, five other customers slipped and fell in the store.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if they can prove that someone acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice\". Malice means acting on purpose to harm someone. If the person did not act on purpose, their behavior must be very bad and they must have been aware of the danger and ignored it.\n\nA court case from many years ago said that someone acts with malice when they ignore the danger and know that it will harm someone. In this case, Martin knew about the danger and ignored it, so a judge may not dismiss Palmer's claim for extra money.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One of the main topics we discussed was whether Islam is a hostile religion.  Now this question is even more important than before.  After 9/11, I saw a big change in how the media viewed Islam.  It went from being very critical to being very accepting.  I think it would have been hard for someone like Barack Obama to run for president in 2001.  He has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nI am interested in the Biography of the Prophet.  What I know of the biography does not match the history of Muhammad.  I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam.  But the biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to see him because they believed in his teachings.  I also see some similarities between the life of Jesus and the stories of Muhammad.  One story is about Muhammad multiplying food and drink for many people.  This makes me think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a kind and special person.  This is not fair to Jesus.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography about people converting to Islam.  But most of the stories come from other people, not from the people who converted.  This makes me doubt the stories.  The writers also try to make Muhammad seem like a kind and wise man.  But history says he was not kind and humble.  I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's early teachings and beliefs are not the same today.  If we look at history, we see that Christianity moved away from its beginnings after Jesus died.  Today, people are becoming more aware and understanding of the past.  They are looking deeper into the true meaning of Christianity.  This will lead to a change in the way people think about their faith.  In the future, many Christians will look back at the teachings added to the religion and compare them to Jesus' original message.  This process will take time, but it is sure to happen.  One day, people will return to Jesus' ideas and throw away the extra teachings that were added over time.  The church will remain strong and lead the way.\n\nThis change will make Christianity more alike everywhere.  People will look and believe in the same way.  This is similar to other events in history.  For example, the Roman Empire once persecuted Christians, but later it became Christian.  Our country once had slavery, but now an African-American can be president.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the beginning and understand Jesus' true message.  This will happen because people will learn to understand Jesus' words as symbols, not as exact statements.\n\nSo, what happened to Jesus' teachings?  If we look back in time, we see that the Jewish people were the first to believe in one God.  They believed in a divinely given message and the importance of the Hebrew scriptures.  Before the Romans took control of Jerusalem in sixty-three B.C.E., the Jewish people were divided into different groups.  These groups were the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many ordinary people.",
            "The book \"The Jungle\" shows how people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and want to make their lives better. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One way is with the owners and managers of big factories. They only want to make their factories bigger and better. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way. They do not care if their pollution hurts people or animals.\n\nThe author of the book, Upton Sinclair, says that the factories are making a lot of pollution. This is bad for people and the Earth. The factories are also very dirty. The author says that the owners do not care about the people who work for them. They want to make money, and they do not care about their workers' well-being.\n\nThe workers are treated very badly. They have to work long hours, and they are not paid well. The owners can lay them off at any time without giving them help finding a new job. In the past, there were no laws to protect workers. This meant that the owners could do what they wanted. The workers were like slaves. They were very poor and had no way to get help.\n\nThe author says that this is not right. He says that workers should be treated fairly and given help when they need it. The book shows how people can be treated unfairly and how they can be forced to live in bad conditions.",
            "Many writers use special techniques to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. Some of these methods are better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. \n\nFitzgerald pairs words together in new ways to give a special feeling about a subject. He also uses symbols to mean something, and then uses them again to remind readers of that feeling. Fitzgerald uses this method with many colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. He builds up a meaning for these colors, and then uses that meaning to create a special feeling about a subject.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to mean the same thing - uniformity. He thinks white is better and more upper class, while gray is old and faded. He starts to use these colors at the beginning of the novel. Many people wear white: Daisy and Jordan always wear white, Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party, and Tom wears a white shirt. Only when Nick is not with the wealthy people is the color white not used.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. He says the streets of New York are like white chasms, the names of people at Gatsby's party are gray, and Catherine's apartment is just one small part of a long row of white buildings. He uses white and gray to describe regular people or places. \n\nAfter Fitzgerald uses these colors enough times, he starts to use them to show readers that something is unimportant or boring. He starts with Daisy. He describes her as wearing white and gray clothes, and readers start to see her as just a regular person, not a special one. Fitzgerald uses this method again to make readers see Daisy as less important. \n\nFitzgerald also describes Daisy's fur as gray, and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's meeting. He uses these colors again to show readers that Daisy is not special, just a regular person.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The weather is warm and sunny. Many crops grow well here. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a big market for food from local farms. Many people want to buy organic food. This means the food is grown without chemicals. There are many groups in San Diego that support this kind of farming. These groups have long waiting lists.\n\nSome farms also offer tours. People can visit the farms to see how the food is grown. They can also walk or hike in the area. This is fun for people who like the outdoors.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps animals and plants. The soil and water are cleaner. However, organic farming can be more expensive. It requires more work to remove pests and weeds. The farmer must also add natural fertilizer to the soil.\n\nThe land in this example is near the town of Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The land is next to a national forest. The area has many plants and animals. Some are endangered, like the kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are becoming less common, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land was once home to Native Americans. Later, people raised cattle and sold wood here. The land was part of a farm a long time ago.\n\nI chose a piece of land from a real estate website. I looked at government programs to see how a small farmer could save money and help the environment. I also found an organic farm in the same area as an example of what might be done with this land.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. Culture is not one thing. It can be different in different ways and not the same everywhere. We often make general statements about cultures, like \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating.\" But these statements are too broad and not true for everyone in a country. Instead of making general statements, it is better to understand what a culture means in a situation and how it can affect talks at the negotiating table. \n\nWhen we meet a foreign culture, we see it in a way that is like our own culture, so we make comparisons. To understand a foreign culture, we can learn about its history or its problems. We should not judge or try to change a culture. We should accept it and work within its limits, especially in a negotiation. If we are in a weaker position, showing respect for traditions and values can help us get past cultural differences and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just between countries. Companies have their own cultures too. A company's culture can be seen in how its employees dress, communicate, or do their jobs. Some companies value hard work and long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. If we look at American companies, we can see how different they can be from each other. Even within a company, there can be different cultures in different parts of the country or in different cities.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because they show us why a culture does things. If a culture values saving face or harmony, a negotiator will not publicly criticize their company or boss. If a culture values making a hard bargain, a negotiator will not settle too quickly. Knowing these things can help us negotiate more effectively. We should also try to learn about our opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation successful.",
            "\"The fool says, 'There is no God.' This idea is found in the Bible. We will look at two arguments for God's existence. Both come from St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. We will compare their ideas.\n\nWe will start with the idea that they both believe in the same God. If we do not, we cannot compare their ideas. We will assume they are talking about the same God.\n\nSt. Anselm says we can know God exists in our minds. He says we cannot think of a God who does not exist. This means we do not need evidence outside of our minds to understand God. He says we can find truth about God inside ourselves.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God's existence with reason and evidence. We do not need faith to understand God. He presents five ideas to support God's existence: change, cause, chance, goodness, and harmony. He says we can know God's existence by thinking about these ideas.\n\nWe will look at these ideas to see if one is better than the other.\"",
            "Long, long ago, a prince was born. He would one day be known as Buddha. This happened in the 500s BC. The prince gave up his life of luxury and became a holy man. He was very wise and his teachings started the religion of Buddhism. There are many kinds of Buddhism, but the most traditional kind is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It has changed over time. You can see this in Sri Lanka, a country with many Theravada Buddhists. There, people celebrate the water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and ordinary people participate in this ceremony. It has some meaning, but Buddha never taught about it.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas over time. This happened for many reasons. Some changes came from inside the community. Some came from people outside the community. Some of these changes were good, and some were bad.\n\nThere are some important terms to understand. An internal force is a change that comes from people inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a change that comes from people outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is a change that hurts the Buddhist community. A benign force is a change that does not mean to harm the Buddhist community. These terms will be used often in this discussion.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of the Tripitaka, a collection of Buddhist books. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas, which are Buddhist teachings. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for Buddhist monks and nuns. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the nature of reality. These ideas include Anatta (there is no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything is impermanent). When people understand these ideas, they can end the cycle of death and rebirth. They can also end lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). This happens when they become enlightened.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. For ordinary people, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not have bad sex, and do not take drugs. For monks and nuns, there are many more rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, desire causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico were once rivals for 57 years. This rivalry lasted from 1836 to 1893. One of the biggest fights between the two countries was the Mexican-American War. The United States won this war in 1846-1848. It got Texas and the American Southwest as new land. Many other fights happened between the two nations. These fights stopped just before World War One.\n\nThe two countries had disagreements on many things, including religion and culture. They also had different interests. This is true for many countries that share a border. They often have disagreements that make their relationship difficult.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are like other countries that have been rivals with a neighbor. David M. Pletcher said, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba did the United States have long-lasting problems.\" These countries are close to the United States and have been rivals. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a problem between the two countries. Many countries have had disagreement about religion in the past. One expert said, \"If Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries.\"\n\nThese two countries had a distrust of each other. This distrust came from the English and Spanish. They were the colonial rulers of the area. This made it hard for the United States and Mexico to be friends.\n\nThe two countries had 17 disagreements during the 57 years of rivalry. Most of these disagreements were about land. The United States and Mexico had problems with bandits and outlaws on their border. They had to use the military to stop these problems.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries began to end when Mexico needed the United States for help. Later, the United States changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick with an illness I did not know I had. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job for safety and security. People told me that finding work would always be easy because people are always sick. So, I chose nursing instead of being a scientist or journalist.\n\nBut I was 46 years old, single, and had no money. I could not work. I am still sick, and I have been living on disability money for 15 years. I have nothing left that is mine. Every day is hard and makes me feel less safe and less good about myself. I know one thing is true: I would not have made it without the help of my family and friends. They are very kind to me.\n\nI know that bad things happen in life. Some things are too hard to handle by ourselves. We should not depend on the government to help us in hard times. But we should help each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nSome Americans say we should be independent and strong like our ancestors. But our ancestors did not make it alone. They helped each other and shared what they had.\n\nSo, be prepared for emergencies. I have a kit with supplies and a plan. I have food, water, and tools. If you can, grow your own food and be ready for hard times. But also know your neighbors and ask for help when you need it.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? \n\nA long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that biologists have not yet found a way to explain even simple shapes in scientific language. Today, we still have not solved this problem. However, we are trying to use math to understand how animals develop and change over time.\n\nWe are studying a type of animal called Prunum. We want to know how its shell develops and changes over time. We used pictures of the animals to measure the shell's shape and size. We put this information into a computer program to create new, possible shell shapes. These shapes can help us understand how the shell can change.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It turns around in a circle, making a spiral shape. This spiral shape is called a whorl. The center of the shell is called the columella. The shell grows in size and makes new whorls over time. Each new whorl is separated from the old one by a line called a suture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the side, or from the front. When we look at a shell from the front, we see the opening of the shell, called the aperture.\n\nWe can count the number of whorls on a shell by looking at it from the top. We draw a line on the shell and count the whorls from that line. We can also look at the path of the opening of the shell as the animal grows. We can use math to describe this path and change the shape of the shell.\n\nBy using math to describe how the shell grows, we can change the shape of the shell and understand how it developed. This can help us understand how animals change over time and how they evolve.",
            "Indonesia's health system has a problem. Many babies and young children are dying. This is not getting better. Indonesia wants to meet some of the United Nations' goals by 2015. But it is not making progress in health for babies and mothers.\n\nThe number of births where a skilled health worker is present has increased. Now 72% of births have a skilled worker. But many of these workers are not doctors or nurses. They are midwives who cannot help in emergency situations. This means many mothers are still dying from bleeding.\n\nFewer children are getting medical help for diarrhea. And not enough mothers are getting help after giving birth. This is a big problem.\n\nDoctors are not performing enough operations on pregnant women. Only 4% of women have cesarean sections. But in cities, 7% of women have this operation. In the countryside, it is only 2%. This shows that rich people can get health care, but poor people cannot.\n\nThe poor have a hard time getting health care. They have to pay out of their own money. This makes it hard for them to get the help they need.\n\nThe question is how to make the health system better. Should Indonesia make special programs for babies and mothers, or should it make the whole health system stronger? Making special programs can help, but it can also cause problems. It can take money away from other areas of health care. And it can make it hard to coordinate services.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the aristocracy.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but are different from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels use mystery and strange situations to make the characters more interesting. This makes it easier for readers to understand their feelings and motives.\n\nA famous example is from the book Oliver Twist. The main character, Oliver, is confused and scared. He hears voices in his head and sees strange things. He is trying to understand what is happening to him. Oliver is talking to two men, Sikes and Crackit, but they are not real. He is still thinking about them even when he is in a different place. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise and sees lights. He is taken away quickly.\n\nIn these strange situations, Oliver learns more about himself and the world around him. He finds out about the true nature of things and what is happening to him. Oliver's health is getting worse, and he is having trouble controlling what is happening to him. He is scared and in pain. He does not have control over his life, and this makes him feel defeated.\n\nThe same thing happens in Wuthering Heights. The author uses strange and dreamlike situations to make the characters more interesting and to show their feelings and motives. The two novels are different from other Victorian novels because they use mystery and strange situations in a different way.",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped students with their school work, but my strengths were in English and reading. I helped a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. He spoke perfect English, but he had a problem with some letters. This was strange. His mother did not speak English. She spoke Spanish. We used my little Spanish to talk. I understood then that Adrian had trouble with the English alphabet. He could read, but he did not know the alphabet well.\n\nI tell this story to show that a language barrier can be a big problem in school. Even if a student speaks perfect English, reading can still be hard. I think we all agree that this is a problem. What can we do? For Adrian, I helped him with English reading. But for other students who do not speak much English, it is more complicated. There is no simple answer. We need to use many solutions together.\n\nOne good idea is a dual language system. This means teaching in two languages, like English and Spanish. This can help all students, not just those who speak Spanish at home. Studies show that students in two-way bilingual programs do better in school. Some people are afraid that this system will waste money and will not help most students. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all students will benefit.\n\nSo, how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages. These helpers can work with teachers to help students who need it. This can help students who do not speak much English.",

We look for a light in the dark to guide us.\n\nI asked my father about his favorite bird. We sat on our porch during a rainstorm. He looked out into the rain. He was thin and his hair was thinning.

            "The Gothic Novel: A New Old Thing\n\nThe Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt calls it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" (Watt) Some people do not like it because it does not have deep meaning. Others praise it for its powerful and exciting qualities. The first Gothic Novel was Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. It used ideas from old romances and modern novels to create a new kind of story. Walpole mixed old and new things to create something new.\n\nThe Gothic Novel uses old ideas from the Middle Ages, like theater, architecture, and traditions. People thought the word \"Gothic\" was old-fashioned. They thought it was not as good as modern ideas. The Gothic Novel combines old and new things in a way that makes it interesting and new for a long time. This is why it has lasted so long.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic Novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a knight to be brave, honest, and good. The Gothic writers liked this idea because they thought it was missing in their society. They used chivalric ideas to make the past seem better than the present. This was especially true for Horace Walpole, who was writing about a time of trouble. He was unhappy with the way people were behaving. In his Novel, The Castle of Otranto, he created a character named Frederic. Frederic is a good example of a chivalric knight. He is a prince, he has been hurt by bad things, and he is supposed to be a brave and honest man.",
            "Supply chain management is a process that gets goods from customers to products. It includes planning and controlling the flow of goods from raw materials to customers. The term \"supply chain management\" was first used by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982.\n\nThere are six important parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers. \n\nThe first step in the supply chain is production. Production is the base of the supply chain. It decides when, why, where, and how things are made. To know what customers want, managers look at the market. The market tells managers what customers need. \n\nManagers decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products. They choose a place that can make the products in big numbers and with good quality. They must remember to make sure customers are happy. \n\nThe next step is to plan work and take care of equipment. Production is very important in the supply chain. If every step is not planned, it can cost a company a lot of time and money. \n\nThe second key part of the supply chain is supply. Supply is making good decisions about a company's ability and partnerships. Managers decide which parts of the company can do each job best. They might also send some work to other companies to make things faster and cheaper. This is called outsourcing. It helps a company be flexible and provide good quality at a low cost.\n\nIn my past job at Wal-Mart and Target, we had printed books and clear processes for every part of the business. This kept everything running smoothly and helped us know what to do. Having a plan helps a company work well and avoid mistakes.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, a sign says. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a cardboard sign with a scary message. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia ruled by a bad government. The government took power in 1962 by force. In 2007, people began to protest. These were the first public protests in ten years. The protests were led by many monks. They wore yellow robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution. \n\nAt first, the government let the monks have peaceful meetings. But soon, the government became violent. They attacked the monks and the monasteries in the country. They arrested foreign journalists and killed one. A Japanese journalist was killed on September 27th, 2007. He was only there to take pictures of the protest. Many people were killed, but the government only said 13 died. \n\nThis is not new. Governments have been trying to control their people for a long time. In ancient Rome, the emperors thought they were gods. In Japan, the emperors were believed to be gods too. They said they came to Earth to make people's lives better. Our current president had a bad friend, Ted Haggard. He led a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere have been many bad examples like this. In 1989, many people protested against the Chinese government in Tiananmen Square. The government said 200-300 people died, but other groups said 2,000-3,000 people died. In the 1990s, people in Rwanda were killed because of their ethnic group. This was called a genocide. The Nazis, led by Hitler, also killed many people who were Jewish. This happened in several countries over many years.",
            "Duke Ellington had a great influence on jazz. He lived a long life and had many years to make music. This helped him create many new and interesting pieces. In some of his music, you do not hear him play the piano much. But when he did play, it was usually to help the other musicians. \n\nEllington was very good at writing music that showed off what each musician could do. He gave them room to play freely and make up their own music. He also wrote music with many parts that worked together well. This made the orchestra sound new and original.\n\nEllington knew how to make each musician sound good on their own. He also knew how to make them sound good together. This helped him write some of the most creative and excellent music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's music. It says he used the human voice as a special instrument. This was something new and exciting in his time. He did this in many of his songs. \n\nOne of Ellington's early songs, Creole Love Call, is a good example. In this song, the voice is used in a special way. It adds texture and color to the music without using lyrics. This was a new idea at the time.\n\nCreole Love Call is a slow and bluesy song with six parts. Here is what happens in each part:\n\nPart 1: The voice and the woodwind instruments talk to each other in a special way.\nPart 2: A trumpet player plays a long and slow solo.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast and high solo with a piano that plays in a special way.\nPart 4: The whole band plays the first part again with the brass and woodwind sections talking to each other.\nPart 5: The woodwind sections play a fast and high call and response, with the brass and rhythm sections playing in a special way.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, but the voice sounds different. It sounds like it is growling like an animal.\n\nThe song ends with a short part that has a high-pitched sound and a strange finish by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add color to his music is a special thing that he did in many of his songs.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music to make it sound good. He uses a trumpet player and a singer to create a special sound. The singer is not singing words, but using sounds like an instrument. \n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to make the music sound interesting. The trombone player plays a special sound that makes the song sound exciting.",

The study showed that eating a diet like this can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe Mediterranean Diet is a special way of eating. It includes a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables. It also includes fish and small amounts of alcohol. The study used a special score to measure how closely people followed this diet.\n\nPrevious studies showed that eating a Mediterranean Diet can be good for you.

They were asked about the foods they ate and how often they ate them. More than 95% of the women kept participating in the study throughout the 20 years.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a Mediterranean Diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They also had a lower risk of dying from heart disease or stroke.

            "In 2007, the United States had a big financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market fell down. Many big companies went out of business. This problem still exists today. We need to ask: how did this happen, and how can we stop it? The problem started because some people in government made bad decisions. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake because the banks did not have enough money to lend. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two important companies, bought these bad loans and sold them to others. \n\nThis was a bad idea. When people could not pay back their loans, the banks did not have enough money. They sold these bad loans to others, and the problem spread to the whole economy. \n\nThe problem started in 1999. The President at the time, Bill Clinton, wanted to be elected again. He wanted to make people happy, so he changed the rules for lending money. This made it easy to give loans to people who could not pay them back. A news reporter named Steven Holmes wrote in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae is giving loans to people who cannot pay them back.\" He said this could cause big problems if there was a crisis. \n\nMany things combined to make the problem worse. New kinds of loans, like adjustable-rate mortgages, were used. These loans are not good because they can increase the amount of money people owe. Many people in the United States borrowed too much money and bought too many houses. This made the economy very weak. When the housing market fell, many people could not pay their loans. The banks were in trouble. The top five big banks in the United States had a combined debt of $4.1 trillion dollars. This was a big problem. Two banks, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch, were sold very cheap. Another bank, Lehman Brothers, went out of business. Some other banks, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had to become commercial banks and follow strict rules. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in debt and were taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Many writers struggle with exposition.  This is the part of a story where you explain too much.  This can be boring for readers.\n\nYou already know the writing tip, \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes.  She writes long parts with no action.  This is not what you want.\n\nExposition is like a devil on your shoulder.  It says, \"Get this information out of the way so you can get to the good parts.\"\n\nExposition is when you tell the reader what happened.  In a movie, this is like one character talking too much.  In a story, the writer is doing the telling.\n\nA good example is when you read a story and learn about the main character's husband.  You learn that he is a good person and that she loves him very much.  But this does not happen in one or two lines of dialogue.  The writer wants you to like the husband and feel sad when he dies.\n\nSo, the writer should show you how much the main character loves her husband.  This can be through what she says and does.  This way, you can feel sad with her when he dies.  You will also learn more about her character.\n\nIn short, you want meat on the bone of the story.  You want to learn about the characters and feel what they feel.\n\nAs a writer, you need to give your reader that meat.  You should not rush through parts of the story.

            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first program was \"live\" from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They talked about this story for about two minutes because it was still happening.\n\nThe second story was about a young man, 18 years old, named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was very badly hurt. The police had not found anyone to arrest yet. They were investigating. This story was short, but I think it was because the man who was hurt was black. I have noticed that when a black person is a victim of a crime, the news does not talk about it as much. If a white person is a victim, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. They talked about where the helicopter crashed and what kind of bullet hit it. They were asking for help to catch the person who did it. They offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said there would be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid-eighties for the weekend.\n\nThey also talked about a store robbery on Clime Road. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. They said he was about six feet tall and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. They talked about his skin color a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer from Texas. He was convicted of selling a lot of marijuana to people in Ohio from Texas. I noticed they talked about how long he was sentenced to prison, thirty years, instead of saying three hundred months. I don't know why they said it that way. They also said he was Hispanic, but that was not important to the story.",
            "There is a special connection between brothers. This connection is very strong and hard to break. It includes many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and hurt. Brothers understand each other in a special way. They can see themselves in their brother. In hard times, the true nature of this connection becomes clear. It can be good or bad. The feelings that come from this connection can be very strong. They can also have serious consequences. When one brother sees his brother, he sees himself. He sees the good and the bad. This is where a brother's true character is shown. \n\nIn a story called \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers show this connection. They have very strong emotions that make them act in different ways. They go on a journey that ends badly. Pride and disappointment mix together in a big way. Only one brother survives. The story shows how the brothers feel about each other. It also shows how their feelings affect their actions.\n\nThe older brother's feelings are very important. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants someone to play with and have fun with. But his little brother, Doodle, is very sick. He can't do the things the older brother wants him to do. This makes the older brother sad and angry. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles at him, he feels happy. This shows that the older brother loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about how brothers feel about each other. It shows how their feelings can be good or bad. It also shows how these feelings can affect their actions.",
            "The human brain is a complex system that processes information. As technology has changed, people have used different ways to describe the brain. Early people compared it to a flat piece of wax, then to a piece of paper, and now to a computer. These comparisons are helpful, but they have limits.\n\nThe brain takes in information from the senses. These include touch, heat, sound, and light. The brain changes this information into electrical signals. It does this again and again in two processes: bottom-up and top-down.\n\nImagine looking at a picture of a black box. Bottom-up processing puts together simple information like color and shape. It helps you see the box. Top-down processing uses this information to help you identify the box. It helps you understand what it is.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides what is important and what to focus on. For example, when you look at the ground, your brain does not notice individual blades of grass. But it can hear your name even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information and uses it again later. There are three kinds of memory: short-term, working memory, and long-term. Information is first encoded, or put into the brain. There are different ways to encode different kinds of information. For example, written words can be encoded based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean.\n\nThe brain keeps information in different ways. Working memory holds information for a short time, about 20 seconds. Long-term memory is stored in the structure of special kinds of proteins.\n\nScientists have many different ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some are based on how people remember things, others on how computers work, and others on how the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network of connected nodes, or points. Each node represents a concept, and they are connected based on how they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wood.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley writes about a bad future in his book Brave New World. He criticizes the way people will live under a system controlled by technology and capitalism. The people in the book value being with friends above being an individual. They are taught from a young age to be happy now, not to think about the future. The citizens are like pawns in a game. They must do what the World Controller says. By looking at the book from a Marxist point of view, we can see that Huxley did not like the way capitalism was growing at that time.\n\nHuxley criticizes capitalism by showing how people are not free to make their own choices. They are forced to buy things they do not need and to work hard to get more things. The people in the book, like the Delta and Gamma classes, do not have the power to make choices. They are controlled by the World Controller. He makes them want to buy and use things. This is like the idea of false consciousness in Marxism. The people do not know how the system works, and they are not free.\n\nThe people in the book do not have real relationships with each other. They are not allowed to feel deep emotions like love or happiness. They only care about how they look and what they have. The way people interact with each other in the book shows that they are not free to be themselves. They are like robots, doing what they are told.\n\nThe people in the book are happy to be in their place in society. They do not want to change. This is like the idea of the proletariat in Marxism. The people are controlled by the system, and they are happy to be controlled. They are not aware of how the system works, and they do not want to know.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be difficult. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, which is on the far side of campus. Going to classes in buildings like Willard, near the center, took 25 minutes on foot. The weather was often bad, so it took even longer. I talked to a graduate who said that not long ago, East Halls was far from other buildings. Now it is surrounded by sports fields, new buildings, and apartments.\n\nAs campus grows, getting around becomes harder. One good solution is a bicycle. But students need to ride them and the campus needs to be good for bicyclists. My friend recently started riding again. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the only way to get around.\" Bicycling is also good for your body. It's the best way to travel on campus. I live off campus, near Thomas building. My bike takes me there in 5 minutes. The road to Thomas is not always easy to ride on. Walking is also good, but I am too busy. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk, which would take 30-40 minutes. That is 2 1/2 hours a week. I don't have that much time."
