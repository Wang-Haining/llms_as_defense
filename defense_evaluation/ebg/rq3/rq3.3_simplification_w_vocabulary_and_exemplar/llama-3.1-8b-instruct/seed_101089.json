            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Insomnia Study: Biological and Sociocultural Models\n\nThis paper looks at the two main models of insomnia: the biological and sociocultural models. The biological model focuses on genetic information and medical aspects of health. The sociocultural model looks at environmental relationships and how they affect race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be primary, related to another mental disorder, or caused by other issues. There are different types of insomnia. The primary sleep disorders are called Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with sleeping or staying asleep. Parasomnias are sleep disorders that involve behavioral or physical problems.\n\nThe biological model of insomnia looks at things like genes and the brain. A study found that a group of nerve cells in the brain called orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. This study was done on mice. The study found that a type of protein in these nerve cells helps control sleep. If this protein is not working correctly, it can cause problems with sleep. This study implies that genes can affect sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model of insomnia looks at how environment can affect sleep. For example, people from different racial and ethnic groups may have different sleep patterns. People from different economic backgrounds may also have different sleep patterns. A person's sleep can be affected by their genetics, their environment, and their lifestyle.\n\nA study found that a type of medicine called baclofen can help people sleep. This medicine works by acting on a type of protein in the brain. This study suggests that the biological model of insomnia is correct. If a person has a genetic problem that affects their sleep, they may need medicine to help them sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model of insomnia also suggests that environment can affect sleep. For example, people who are poor may have trouble sleeping because they are worried about money. People who are from a different culture may have different sleep patterns. A person's sleep can be affected by many things, including their environment and their lifestyle.\n\nIn conclusion, the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia are two different ways of looking at the same problem. The biological model looks at genes and the brain. The sociocultural model looks at environment and lifestyle. Both models are important for understanding insomnia.",
            "What is Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD)?\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. It is not a hearing problem. When we have a hearing problem, we cannot hear sounds. But people with CAPD can hear sounds. The problem is with the brain. The brain does not work correctly to understand what we hear.\n\nThe brain is the control center of the body. It helps us understand what we see and hear. For people with CAPD, the brain does not work well to separate words and other sounds. They have trouble hearing in noisy places.\n\nWhat is the history of CAPD?\n\nCAPD was first mentioned in the 1950s. Doctors were trying to understand children with communication problems. They were looking for ways to test these children. In 1954, some doctors started testing children with CAPD. In 1961, they found a way to test how the brain works when we hear two things at the same time.\n\nHow does CAPD affect people?\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble with many things. They may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. They may not understand sounds that are in a pattern. They may not know what someone means by a change in voice. They may block one sound with another sound. They may not understand sounds in the right order.\n\nHow is CAPD diagnosed?\n\nWe diagnose CAPD by looking at how a person listens and acts when they hear things. We use many tests to see if a person has CAPD. These tests are not always the same, and we do not know the cause of CAPD.\n\nWhat can a teacher do to help a student with CAPD?\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in many ways. They can provide a quiet place for the student to work. They can help the student to listen carefully. They can show the student how to repeat words and sounds. They can help the student to understand what they hear. They can be patient and understanding. They can help the student to learn and succeed.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be useful for deceiving people. But, in the end, it can be hard to stop using a disguise. If you keep using one, you may lose yourself. The problem is that stopping a deception can cause trouble. You may feel alone and separated from people you care about. Some people may not be upset when they find out they were tricked. Others will be angry and hurt.\n\nThe play makes us think about why people use disguises, especially when they pretend to be the opposite sex. In Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself from harm. She is good at acting like a man, but it makes her feel alone and separate from the women around her. She also has feelings for two people, Orsino and Olivia. Orsino is the man who loves Viola, but Viola is afraid to tell him the truth. Olivia falls in love with Viola, who is pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play shows how using a disguise can make people see their true feelings. Olivia and Orsino may have feelings for each other, but they do not show them because of Viola's disguise. This makes us wonder if people's feelings are truly what they seem. Is Olivia in love with Viola because she is a man, or does she really have feelings for women? The play does not give us a clear answer.\n\nThe play suggests that people may be attracted to people who look a certain way, not just because of who they are. This is shown when Olivia easily falls in love with Sebastian, who looks like Viola. This makes us think about how people judge others based on how they look.",
            "The German government ruled many lands outside of Germany. This government was known for its unfair and cruel treatment of people. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. However, the German government was not always unfair. It supported education in some of its colonies. \n\nIn East Africa, the British found many Africans who could read and write when they took control of the area in 1919. German schools in Kamerun and other colonies were also good. \n\nBut South West Africa was different. The government in this area did not do much to help Africans get an education. Instead, it relied on missionary groups to teach the local people. The government built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools. But the Africans in South West Africa did not have the same opportunities. Most of them could not read or write.\n\nThe German government spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in South West Africa. This had a big effect on the area even after the Germans left. Other German colonies had many educated Africans, but South West Africa was different. Many Africans in this area did not have an education.\n\nWe need to study why this happened. This paper will look at the reasons and the attitudes of the people who lived in South West Africa.\n\nThere is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of the information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of these sources compare education in different colonies. They show that each colony had its own system of education. One study compares South West Africa and East Africa. The writer of this study says that the number of white people in South West Africa was the reason for its different education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate and many white people lived there by 1913. But the African population did not have the same opportunities. The number of white people in South West Africa was higher than in other German colonies.",
            "Heavy Metal Music: A Growing Genre\n\nHeavy metal music has changed a lot over the last 100 years. Many kinds of metal music exist today, making it hard to list them all. Also, most metal music styles have smaller groups, or sub-genres, within them. Heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive metal music styles. It shows a wide range of feelings, usually on the darker side.\n\nThis music style started to grow and change about 40 years ago. People began to see that heavy metal had a lot of possibilities and started to create their own sub-genres. This led to even smaller groups, or sub-sub-genres, and it continues to grow today.\n\nNow, we have many different kinds of heavy metal groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal really is. But to understand the heavy metal music that is popular today, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy metal is known for its strong and dark sound. It often has a lot of power, a lot of loud music and a lot of energy. People who play heavy metal music are usually very good at their instruments. This is clear in the music. Heavy metal is also a movement that is connected to drug use. In the 1970s, many people used psychedelic drugs, which made them create crazy and different music. This music had a lot of dark and powerful qualities that were new to the music world. Some later groups took their ideas from the dark and powerful qualities of the Romantic Era.\n\nMany songs in heavy metal express the dark side of life. These songs show that heavy metal is a music style that is connected to the darker side of life. One good example of this is the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. This song shows the ups and downs of drug use and is considered one of the first heavy metal songs. It was made in response to a similar song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau and his Dream\n.\n\nBefore the famous Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was creating his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His painting, The Dream, made in 1910, shows a woman in wonder at the beauty of the land she visits in a dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted recognition, approval, and praise from other artists and art lovers. But he had a big problem: he was not sure if he should follow the styles of others or be himself.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France on May 21, 1844. His father was a hardware dealer. Rousseau grew up and got a job with the government when he was young. He worked there for 40 years. He got no special training in art, but he started painting when he was older. His first wife and many of their children died. He felt sad and wanted a new life. So, he started painting to feel better.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time, Rousseau was not a romantic painter. He was a folk painter who wanted to make art like regular people. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he was not sure how to do it. He was not educated in art and started painting late in life. Many other artists were already famous when he began to make a name for himself. It was not until around the same time that another famous artist, Matisse, was becoming well-known that Rousseau started to get recognition.\n\nThe artist Jan Gordon wrote that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was simple and easy to understand, so people would like his art. Matisse, on the other hand, did not want to paint in a way that was boring or common.",
            "Many smart people think there is a strong connection between what is good and what is beautiful. I agree with this idea. It makes sense to me. John Keats says in a poem, \"Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. That is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life from education and experience. But we seem to understand what is good and what is beautiful without being taught. Both what is good and what is beautiful are attempts to explain why something is good or why something is beautiful. We do not make a list of rules to decide what is good or what is beautiful.\n\nIn fact, it is hard to fully explain why a painting is good art or why an action is a good action. We can talk about the colors in a painting, or the way the artist used light and shadow. But these things do not explain why a painting is good. When we talk about a favorite painting, we often say \"There's just something about it.\" This is because there is something more to good art and good actions that we cannot explain.\n\nI think that art and good actions have this same quality. Flannery O'Connor says that a story is a way to say something that cannot be said in any other way. No matter how much we describe a story, there is something more that remains. I believe that what is good also has this quality. The German philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein says that what is good cannot be expressed. It is beyond words.\n\nI think that what is good and what is beautiful are connected because they both touch us deeply. We feel them at a level that is hard to explain. This connection is even stronger when it comes to stories. What makes a story good is its moral value. It is the values that we find in a story that make it important to us. Living involves making choices and decisions based on values. Stories help us understand these values and make them important to us.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united and has its own special culture. This culture is from many different people who came to Germany long ago. Some came from the mountains near München, while others came from the city of Kiel near the Baltic Sea.\n\nYou can feel this culture in many places in Germany. It is in the city of Köln on the Rhine River, in the center of Germany, and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River. So, it is not surprising that Germany has a mix of cultures from different people and tribes.\n\nThe land where the Germans live is called Germania. The name \"Germany\" is not clear. Some people think it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from the Gauls, who lived in a different area. They called the Germans \"Germanus\" because they were different from them.\n\nThe Romans knew the Germans well. They fought many battles with them. The Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his history book. He said they were a strong and noisy people who lived beyond the Rhine River. They fought with the Gauls, who lived near the Rhine.\n\nSome people think the name \"Germany\" came from a special spear the Germans used in battle. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This could mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said they were the original people of Germany and did not come from other countries. He said they were a strong and proud people who did not want to leave their land.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany, but they traded with the Germans and fought battles with them. The Germans traded goods and skills with the Romans, and some even served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down and saw nothing in my mind.  The view before me was just a picture.  I did not think about the picture.  I just looked at it.  Thoughts came and went quickly.  My mind was active, but I did not think deeply.  \n\nI learned to draw from a book.  The book was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I wanted to be an artist since I was six years old.  The book teaches about pencils and how the brain sees lines.  One technique is to draw a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simpler.  \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table.  I could not imagine drawing a square around it.  I was too busy looking at it.  I was amazed.  I wanted to be an artist like Picasso, who used blue colors, or Monet, who loved green.  I wanted my picture, called \"Work in Brown,\" to be great.  \n\nI picked up my pencil.  My hand moved to the paper.  My mind was ready to create.  I started to draw.  But my hand moved to the toilet handle.  Something was stuck.  I tried to fix it.  I used a mop to clean up the mess.  It was a hard job.  Finally, I was able to get rid of the problem.  I was ready to create again.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several things contribute to this problem. One reason is that young brains are not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers have not had much experience. This lack of experience causes more accidents and more serious problems like driving off the road or speeding.\n\nYoung drivers do worse when they have friends in the car. Most young drivers drive with friends. A study showed that the age of the passenger and the number of accidents are connected.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for young drivers. They require special licenses that limit the hours they can drive and say they cannot drive with other young people in the car.\n\nI think these special licenses are not enough. The problem is that young drivers are not ready to handle the risks of driving. Some experts think it is too early to give a regular license to anyone under 19 or 20 years old. This age group likes to take risks for the fun of it. It makes sense to wait until this desire to take risks goes away. If we continue to give licenses to young teens, many more accidents will happen. The number of young drivers will grow in a few years, and the number of accidents will also grow.\n\nA simple solution is to make a law that no one under 18 can drive. Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can get a license. A special permit can still be given before a full license, and a certain number of practice hours are still required. This is the same as most states. This law will save many lives and prevent many accidents.\n\nThis idea is not new. Many people think it is a good idea.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I watched all trick films made by Thomas Edison from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of these films. Trick films use editing to create illusions. I studied these films to understand their storytelling and camera work. Most trick films from this time are set in a single place. The camera does not move, and the shots are long and medium length. The films follow a rule: one shot equals one film. However, some films from the early 1900s break this rule.\n\nOne thing that all trick films have in common is that they were filmed in a single set. The camera did not move to follow people or objects. This style comes from theater and vaudeville shows. The camera was fixed in one place. People in the films only moved side to side, not towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" actors enter from one side and move back and forth.\n\nTrick films mostly use long and some medium shots. They do not use close-up shots. This is because the theater and vaudeville tradition shows the whole performance at one time. Actors did not move towards the camera, so close-ups were not used.\n\nMost trick films are short, about a minute or less. They are like short vaudeville tricks that show magic or disappearing acts. However, some trick films use many small shots to create an illusion. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a close look shows that the \"head\" is actually a separate shot. The filmmakers joined many small shots together to create a single illusion.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas. He was a farmer, but his work in politics made him known for his strong opinions on personal freedom and government. Taylor believed that the best system of government is based on farming. His ideas about government were influenced by his work on farms.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a chance to create the perfect system of government. This was because the country was new and had no old traditions to follow. This allowed the creators of the government to make a system of self-government. Taylor believed in the rights of all people. He thought these rights are connected and important for everyone. If one right is taken away, it weakens all the other rights. He said the government should not be able to take away these rights.\n\nTaylor believed that in a natural state, people with power and evil intentions do well. But in a society, this should not be true. He thought a good government must understand the good and bad in people. Taylor believed that government is like people. It has virtues and vices. He said good principles are those that protect private property, help farming, and reduce capitalism. He thought a government based on good principles would work fairly, even if its leaders are selfish.\n\nTaylor wanted a limited government with few powers. He thought the federal government should only have the powers listed in the Constitution. He knew a strong federal government is expensive and may be cruel. But he also thought a simple, strict interpretation of the Constitution could be bad. He believed we need to understand the writers' intentions when they made the Constitution. Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States. It explains that the country is a group of states, not just one nation.",
            "We look at Figure 17, and see a big drop in people sending in their commuter log information in the third month of the project. This is not good news, and it's hard to understand why it happened. Winter arrived at our New England school, and this time of year fewer people walk or ride their bicycles to campus. This might be part of the reason for the drop in submissions. December is also the end of the fall school term. Students and teachers are busy finishing their work and getting ready for winter break. They might not have time to fill out the commuter log. The winter break is a month long, and many people do not have to come to school. When classes start again in late January, we see a decrease in the number of logs submitted again. This is not a good sign. We created a special week in March called Carpool Challenge Week to try and get people more interested in the project again. This effort was successful, and more people sent in their logs that month. So, we face challenges in keeping people engaged in the project. There are natural reasons for this, such as the holidays and school breaks. We also have a big problem: people like to drive their cars. This is a part of our culture. To get people to try other ways of getting to school, we need incentives. We offered prizes like gift certificates to local stores and restaurants. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bike or a new car. This might have kept people more interested in the project.",
            "An ETF is a special kind of investment. It is like a fund that follows a group of stocks, a product, or a mix of investments. But it is more flexible and trades like a single stock on a market.\n\nAn ETF gives you the advantage of a group of stocks and the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy with borrowed money, and buy as few shares as one. These benefits are very attractive. But ETFs have some costs, like paying a fee for every trade, just like buying a stock. There are also many kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nTo understand ETFs, we will look at the ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to know if owning one ETF is like owning a group of ten stocks. We also want to know if there is a better way to choose these same stocks.\n\nWe cannot look at all the stocks in the ETF. So we will look at the top 10 stocks, which make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 stocks and the percentage of the ETF they make up.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will use a special calculation. We will look at how these stocks would do if we had a portfolio of just these 10 stocks. We will compare this to the ETF.\n\nThe chart below shows the results. We can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks would make 6.11% more than the ETF. It would also have a lower risk, or Beta, of 0.12. This means that the top 10 stocks could provide a higher return with less risk.\n\nBut we need to be sure that these results are not just a coincidence. We need to see if the difference between the two portfolios is real. To do this, we will look at the standard deviation of each stock. We will compare this to the standard deviation of the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem, Dream-Land, is one of his important works. Poe uses a word called \"Thulé\" twice at the beginning and end of the poem. This word is from a place in ancient stories. The ancient Greeks thought it was the edge of the world.\n\nPoe was interested in the writings of a German author named Goethe. Some people think Poe took ideas from Goethe's writing. A writer named Karl J. Arndt wrote about the similarity between Poe's poem \"Politian\" and Goethe's poem \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe is famous for writing a play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king whose wife dies. He then drinks heavily and cries because he misses his wife. He decides it is time for him to die and gives his things to his children. He then goes to a cliff, throws a special cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in this poem is like the man in Poe's Dream-Land. They both drink too much and are very sad.\n\nGoethe's poem \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's Dream-Land can be read together. In Dream-Land, the speaker says he is in a dark and lonely place. He sees a world without color and is haunted by dead friends. These ideas are also in \"The King of Thulé.\" The king in \"The King of Thulé\" just lost his wife and is also lonely and sad.\n\nGoethe was a well-known writer, and Poe would have known his work. Poe liked another writer named Tennyson. Poe said he admired Tennyson. Poe would have also known Goethe's work because many of his writings were copied and printed after the original publication.",
            "In California, a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on spilled applesauce in a grocery store can ask for extra money damages from the store. This is because the store manager knew about the spill twice and did not clean it for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner at the time.\n\nThe customer, Jennifer Palmer, has a good chance of winning her claim for extra damages. To win this claim, she must show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with mean and selfish behavior. He must have known that not cleaning the spill would hurt someone. The court will probably not throw out her claim right away.\n\nPalmer can say that Martin should have known the spill would hurt someone because many other customers had slipped and fallen in the store in the past. Even after that, Martin still did not clean the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's behavior was mean is not very strong, but it is still a good point. Many customers had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009, and Martin did not take action to keep the store safe.\n\nOn one day in October 2009, an employee of the store, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill. Martin said he was on break and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Another employee, Mary Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt badly.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra damages if the other person acted with bad behavior. The law says this happens when the person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is when the person intended to hurt someone, or when they did something very bad and knew it would hurt someone, but they did it anyway.\n\nIn this case, the judge will decide if Martin acted with malice. If he did, Palmer can get extra damages.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One big question we talked about was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is still very important today.  Since 9/11, I have seen how the media has changed its view of Islam.  It used to be mostly negative.  Now it is very tolerant.  In 2001, I do not think Americans would have voted for a president with a name like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam.\n\nI read the biography of Muhammad. It is interesting.  I learned that Muhammad was not a strong leader who forced people to be Muslim.  Instead, he was a kind person who showed people the truth through his words and actions.  People came to him because they believed in him.  This is different from what I thought I knew about Muhammad.\n\nI also see some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the life of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food and drink for many people.  The writer of the biography wants Muhammad to be seen as a humble and kind person.  But this can take away from the greatness of Jesus.  It is like taking credit for someone else's work.  I think this is not right.\n\nI do not like it when the biography tells stories that are not true.  Sometimes the stories are secondhand.  The writer heard from someone else who heard from someone else.  This makes the stories seem less believable.\n\nI have a problem with how the biography presents Muhammad.  The writer says he was a kind and wise person.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's life.",
            "Jesus' teachings and ideas are no longer the main part of Christian thought today.  This happened after his death.  If we look at Christian history, we see a trend.  It is a trend of Christianity moving away from its start.  Many people today are becoming more aware of this.  They want to go back to the ideas Jesus taught.  They want to know what he really said.  This movement will grow.  It will become bigger and stronger.  People want to know what Jesus' ideas were.  They want to know the real meaning of Christianity.  It may take a long time, but it will happen.  The Christian church will go back to its original form.  People will forget about the ideas added to the religion.  They will learn what Jesus said about God.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will think and believe the same way.  The Christian church will still be strong.  But people will be more alike in their thinking.  There will be less difference between different groups of Christians.  This has happened before in history.  The Roman Empire used to be against Christians.  But later, it became Christian.  Our country used to treat African-Americans badly.  But now they have leaders.  This change is coming to the Christian church.  It will be a big change.  To understand what Jesus said, people will have to think about his words as symbols, not as facts.\n\nLooking far back in history, we see only one main idea:  the Jewish religion.

The leaders of big companies are a good example. They want to make a lot of money and make their companies bigger. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way.\n\nThe book describes the big factories. They are black and have big chimneys that send out bad smoke. The smoke hurts people and animals. The leaders do not care about this. They also do not care about the animals in the pens. The pens are dirty and have animal waste. \n\nThe leaders also do not care about their workers. They work long hours and do not get paid much. The leaders can fire them at any time without giving them help finding a new job. The workers live in bad conditions and are very poor. They are treated like slaves. The book says they are as helpless as slaves were in the past.\n\nThe system in the book is not fair. The workers have no protection. They cannot get help or information. Some groups, called unions, are supposed to help the workers, but they often make money from the poor workers. This makes the workers' lives worse.\n\nThe book shows that many people in this situation are not able to take care of themselves. They are very poor and have no chance to escape.",

Scott Fitzgerald uses these special ways in his book The Great Gatsby. \nSome of his techniques are very effective. He often puts two words together that do not usually go together to give readers a certain feeling about a subject. \nFitzgerald does this with many colors, including gold, green, white, and gray. He builds up meaning for these colors and then uses them to make readers feel a certain way.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show that something is not special or important. \nAt first, the book describes many people wearing white and gray. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt. Daisy and Jordan are often dressed in white. Fitzgerald also uses these colors to describe ordinary things. The streets of New York are like white chasms. The cars and land in a valley are gray.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show that something is not special. He uses them to make readers feel that something is common or usual. This happens with Daisy. Fitzgerald describes her as dressed in white and gray. Readers start to see her as not a special person, but just a part of Gatsby's life.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors many times in the book to show that some people and things are not special.

They can also watch birds and other animals.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps animals and plants in the area. But it can be harder and more expensive than farming with chemicals. Farmers must work harder to remove pests and weeds. They must also use special methods to make the soil healthy without chemicals. \n\nThe area near the town of Potrero in California is good for farming. It has chaparral, grassland, and oak trees. It is next to the Cleveland National Forest. Many plants and animals live there. Some are in danger and need protection.

            "Culture plays a very important role in any negotiation. Culture is not the same for everyone. It is not one thing or one idea. It can be different in many ways. We should not say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too broad and not very accurate.\n\nTo be a good negotiator, we need to understand what culture means in a specific situation. We need to know how a culture can help or hurt the negotiation. When we meet a new culture, we should think about how it is like or different from our own culture. We should try to learn about the culture's history and what it values.\n\nInstead of judging a culture, we should accept it for what it is. We should respect its traditions and beliefs. This can help us get past any problems and move the negotiation forward. If we are in a weaker position, showing respect can be especially helpful.\n\nCulture is not just about countries or nations. A company can have its own culture. For example, some companies value hard work, while others value work-life balance. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they make decisions. Even within the same country, different companies can have very different cultures.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell us why people in a culture behave in certain ways. If saving face is important, people will not want to lose face in a negotiation. If a culture values hard work, people will not want to give up easily. Before a negotiation, we should think about these things. We should also try to learn about our opponent's values and personality to be successful.",
            "A famous Bible verse says: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. It is also in the beginning of an argument by St. Anselm about God's existence. Thomas Aquinas believes the same thing. Their arguments are about the same idea, so we will compare them. We will start by assuming they are both right about God.\n\nThis God is the one in the Bible. If we talk about a different kind of god, we can't compare their arguments. They are trying to prove the same kind of God. So, we will look at their ideas. \n\nSt. Anselm's idea is that we can know God just by thinking. He says if we know something, we can't think about it not existing. This is a bit hard to understand, but the main idea is that God's existence is in our minds. We don't need outside evidence to know God. This is like faith in the Bible. It's not about proof, but about believing something because it feels true.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can know God by using reason and looking at the world. He doesn't need faith. He says we can use five different ideas to prove God's existence. These are change, cause, need, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He says we can know God is real just by thinking about these things.",

He taught people important ideas, and his teachings led to the creation of Buddhism.\n\nToday, Buddhism is a very old religion, about twenty-five hundred years old. It has changed over time.

But Buddha never taught about this celebration.\n\nBuddhism has changed in many ways. This is true for both monks and laypeople. The ideas of Buddhism have been different over time. This is because of forces both inside and outside the Buddhist community. These forces are either friendly or not friendly to Buddhism.\n\nThere are some important words to know for this discussion. An internal force is a force from inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a force from people who are not Buddhist. A hostile force hurts the Buddhist community. A friendly force does not hurt or help the Buddhist community. These words will be used often in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basics of Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, three groups of Buddhist texts. These texts tell us about the Buddha's teachings. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has many teachings from the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka tells us rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka explains the meaning of life and death. It tells us that everything is not permanent and that we have no soul. This is important to understanding Buddhism.\n\nBuddhists also follow the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome. These truths are very important in Buddhism.",
            "Many years ago, the United States and Mexico were enemies. They fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and took some land from Mexico. This event made the two countries have a long-lasting problem.\n\nThey had many small fights over the years. The problem started because of different ideas about religion, culture, and tradition. The two countries also had different interests.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have disagreements. The United States and Mexico are not alone. Many other countries have problems with their neighbors.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher said that the United States has had big problems with only two countries: Mexico and Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States.\n\nThe two countries had a big disagreement about religion. The United States did not like the Mexican Catholic church. This caused a problem between the two countries for a long time.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not get along because of the English and Spanish. These countries had a long time ago. The US and Mexico liked or disliked the same things because of this.\n\nThe US and Mexico had 17 big disagreements between 1836 and 1893. Most of these disagreements were about land. Some people from Mexico would cross the border and take things from the US. The US and Mexico had to use force to stop these problems.\n\nEventually, the US and Mexico became friends. Mexico needed the US for help, and the US stopped trying to take its land. This made the two countries stop being enemies.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got sick and could not move. This was a surprise. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job because it seemed safe. People will always be sick, and I could always find work.\n\nI wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing because it was safe. I was 46 years old and had no money. I could not work. Today, I still have a problem moving. I get money from the government because I am sick. But I have no money for myself.\n\nI have to work hard every day. I am not safe and I am not happy. I do not know what will happen tomorrow. But I know that my family and friends helped me. They helped me when I was weak.\n\nMy point is that bad things happen in life. We cannot control everything. We need to help each other. We need to ask for help. We should not just depend on the government.\n\nSome people in the US think we should not depend on the government. But I think we should help each other. We should be kind to each other. Our ancestors were not alone. They helped each other. They shared food and supplies. They worked together.\n\nWe should be prepared for bad things. I have a box with food and water. I have a first aid kit and a way to make water clean. I have a light and candles. But we also need to know our neighbors. We need to be kind to each other.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time in the way they do. Are there rules that control how they change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that even now, biologists do not know how to use math to describe the simplest living things. Even today, this is still true.\n\nRecently, people have used math to understand how some animals build their skeletons. They studied how animals develop their skeletons over time (ontogeny) and how their skeletons change over many generations (phylogeny). Our study is exploring how math can help us understand how animals change their skeletons.\n\nWe used special pictures of a type of shellfish to understand how its skeleton changes. We looked at the pictures and found numbers that can be used to model how the shellfish skeleton changes. We entered these numbers into a computer program to create new shell shapes. These new shapes can help us understand the limits of how the shellfish skeleton can change.\n\nWe can think of a shell as a tube that grows over time. The shell grows in a spiral shape, like a snake. Each part of the spiral is called a whorl. The whorls grow around a center point. The center point is called the columella. The shell grows in different ways, and a line separates each whorl. This line is called a suture.\n\nThe largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The rest of the whorls are called the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can see shells in four different ways: from the top, bottom, front, and back. The usual way to see a shell is from the front, with the opening facing us and the top pointing up.\n\nWe can count the whorls by looking at the shell from the top and finding the first line. Then, we draw a line and count the whorls from that line. We can estimate the number of whorls to a quarter.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it builds its shell. We can find the path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the opening. We can draw a picture of the path and use math to understand how the shell grows.\n\nOnce we understand how the shell grows, we can change the numbers and see how the shell would change. This can help us understand how animals change over time.",
            "Indonesia's baby and young child death rates have not changed much in ten years. The country is making progress in some areas, like water and sanitation. However, the country is not doing well in meeting the goals for better health and care for mothers and children. The reasons for this are many and will be explained below. These reasons show that Indonesia's health system needs to be improved, not just individual programs.\n\nMore mothers are getting help from a trained health worker when they give birth. Seventy-two percent of births now have this help. However, this number includes traditional workers like midwives who may not have the training to help in emergencies. This means that many mothers are still at risk. In addition, fewer children with diarrhea are getting treated by a health professional. We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being cared for after giving birth. The numbers are not good across the country.\n\nNot enough mothers are having C-sections, which are operations to help with difficult births. The number of C-sections is only four percent. This number is low. It also shows another problem. In cities, seven percent of mothers have C-sections. But in rural areas, the number is only two percent. This shows that city areas have more access to good healthcare. Another problem is that poor people have less access to healthcare. There is a big difference in how many people use healthcare services between the poorest and richest families. This is because poor families have to pay for healthcare out of their own money.\n\nTo fix the problems with baby and mother care, we need to ask how to make healthcare services more available. Should Indonesia develop special programs or improve the overall healthcare system? There is no question that special programs can be helpful. They have clear goals and can make progress faster. However, there are some problems with this approach. One problem is that spending a lot of money on one area can mean that other areas get less money. This can make it hard for healthcare workers to choose where to work. Another problem is that many programs can be uncoordinated and lead to extra paperwork and waste.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed stories about the rich people of the time.  Two books that are considered Victorian but are different from this kind are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting.  This makes the characters more believable and shows what they are thinking and feeling.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to Oliver.  He sees and hears things that are not real.  This shows what is happening inside Oliver's mind.  He is worried and scared.  When Oliver is shot, he remembers it later like it was a dream.  He is very sick and can't control what is happening to him.\n\nOliver feels he has no control over his life.  He can't even try to save himself when he is in danger.  This shows that Oliver is losing hope.  He is starting to give up.  He feels defeated.  He is trapped in a world where he is not in control.\n\nWuthering Heights is another book that uses mystery and strange events.  The day and night are like a dream.  They are very long and very short.  This shows how confusing and scary the world can be.\n\nThese two books are different from other Victorian novels.  They use strange and mysterious events to make the characters more believable and interesting.  They show what is happening inside the characters' minds and how they are feeling.",
            "I worked with students after school two years ago. I helped them with their school work, but I was good at helping with English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I thought something was strange. Some letters he could read easily, but others he could not read at all. Adrian spoke very good English, but he was from a Latino family. I was helping to take care of the other students when Adrian's mother came to the after-school program. She did not speak English. We used a little Spanish to communicate. I then understood that Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. I do not know if this helped him, but I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about the problem of language barriers in schools, especially in California. I also tell it to show that the problem is not always clear. Even a student who speaks good English can still have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was to teach him the English alphabet and how to pronounce words. For students who do not speak much English, the answer is more complex. There is no one answer. We need to use many methods: dual language programs, mainstream education, private tutors, and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.\n\nI think dual language programs are a good idea. They are not just for students who speak Spanish, but for all students. Studies show that students in these programs do better in school. Many people are afraid that this will waste money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use these programs more often, all students will benefit. So, how can we do this? Do we need to make all teachers bilingual? No, that is not possible. However, we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "When we are young, people often tell us about something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it, while others visit the temple or search inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religions given to them by their parents. But some reject them completely. They do not believe there is something beyond what they know in their own world. They may choose one value system, then change it for another. We all try to understand a part of ourselves in our own way.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our front porch. He said his favorite bird was the cardinal. We listened to the rain on the tin roof. The rain came from the gutters and drowned the plants near the porch. My father looked out into the rain. He seemed to be thinking and remembering. He was thinner and looked weak. His hair was thin and sparse. He did not look at me. I felt sad and afraid. I could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. If I did, it would make it more real. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out into the rain together.\n\nMy father died five days after my twenty-second birthday in December. He had cancer. The treatment did not ease his pain, but it kept him alive a little longer than the doctors said. What was the point, I thought? If God existed, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. I did not want to see the man who created me go away. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive, not when he was sick. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting for the news. But no one called me.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a strange mix of old and new ideas. This is how Ian Watt describes it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel\". The Gothic style has been praised and blamed. Some people say it has no real meaning. Others say it is great because it creates a sense of fear and excitement. The first \"Gothic Novel\" was written by Horace Walpole. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto\". Walpole used ideas from old stories and new ways of writing to create a new style. He used old theater and modern ideas to write a story that was new.\n\nThe Gothic style uses many old ideas from medieval times. These ideas came from theater, architecture, and traditions. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things. It was seen as old-fashioned in a world that valued progress and new ideas.\n\nThe combination of the old and the new is what makes the Gothic style stay interesting for a long time. It is like a new and old thing at the same time.\n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic stories is the idea of chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a knight to be brave and honorable. This idea is important in Gothic stories because it represents a time when people believed in chivalry. The writer, Horace Walpole, was unhappy with the world he lived in. He wanted to show that the good qualities of the past were missing in the present. He used the idea of chivalry to make the past seem better than the present.\n\nIn the story, there is a character named Frederic. He is a prince who has suffered in the past. He is described as a brave and chivalrous knight. He is a good example of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that people used to idealize. The writer is exaggerating this image to show that the qualities of the past are not present in the present.",
            "Supply Chain Management\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the raw materials and then to the customer. This process includes production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Supply chain management is used by managers of businesses to give good service to customers.\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These six parts help businesses give the best service to customers.\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base of the whole supply chain. Managers must know what customers want. To know what customers want, managers look at the market. The market shows what customers need. Once managers understand customer needs, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory will make the most and best products. Managers think about customer needs and satisfaction when making these decisions.\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on work schedules and equipment maintenance. Production is a very important step in the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned carefully, the company will waste time and money.\n\nExample: I used to work at Walmart and Target. Both companies have a plan for every part of the business. They have a plan for how employees should dress and how to receive shipments from trucks. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly without confusion.\n\nSupply is the second key part of the supply chain. Supply means making decisions about what skills a factory should have and which companies to partner with. A company may have many different factories for one product. Each factory has different equipment, workers, and skills. Managers decide which factory is best for each part of the product. They may also decide to work with other companies. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps companies make good products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "A message in Burma says Hitler is alive. \nEllen Page, an actress from America, holds a sign that says this on a street corner. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strong group of military leaders. They took control of the country in nineteen sixty-two. In two thousand seven, many people in Burma protested on the streets. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. They were led by Buddhist monks who wear orange robes. Many people in Burma began to support the protests. But the government started to use violence against the monks. They attacked monasteries and arrested journalists who came to report on the protests. One journalist was killed in September of that year.\n\nBad things have happened in Burma before. The government there has always tried to control its people. In the past, some leaders thought they were chosen by gods to rule. In another country, Japan, leaders were believed to be gods who came to help their people. In the United States, a president had meetings with a leader of a group that does not like freedom. \n\nThere have been big protests in many countries. In China, many people protested in nineteen eighty-nine. They did not want the government to rule them. Many people died in this protest. In Rwanda, a group of people killed others because of their color or their ideas. In Germany, a long time ago, a man named Hitler killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington's work in jazz is very important because he lived a long time and could keep creating music. His piano playing is not always easy to hear in many of the songs he composed, but as a composer, he was great at writing songs that let the band members show off their talents. Ellington created a framework for musicians to improvise. He also wrote tightly organized pieces that used the special style of each musician to bring out their musical ideas. This way, he created new and original sounds to fit each song. Ellington knew how to get the best sound from each musician and how to put them together to make a great band. This helped him write some of the most innovative and excellent jazz music in history.\n\nA music dictionary, The Grove Music dictionary, talks about Ellington's style and his new ideas. It mentions a song called Creole Love Call. This song is an early example of Ellington using the human voice as a musical instrument. He did this throughout his career. The song is a slow, 12-bar blues. It has six parts: \n\nPart 1: The singer and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The singer starts with a smooth sound, then gets rougher at the end.\n\nPart 2: A muted trumpet player plays a solo that makes the basic melody sound better. He emphasizes some long notes.\n\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays very high notes. The piano player adds a special rhythm to the music.\n\nPart 4: The whole band repeats part 1. The brass and woodwind sections talk to each other.\n\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start talking to each other. The brass and rhythm sections play a special rhythm.\n\nPart 6: This part is like part 1. The singer starts to sound like a musical instrument. The singer uses a special technique called \"growl\" to sound like an instrument.\n\nThe song ends with a short part that includes a vocal run and a strange sound from a trombone.\n\nEllington was very good at using the human voice to add color to his music. This is just one example of his style.\n\nIn the song Hot and Bothered, Ellington combines his skill at writing tight rhythms with his ability to hear the special sound of each musician. A singer and a trumpeter play a phrase together. The singer uses the vocal parts of the trumpet player's music and the trumpet player uses the vocal parts of the singer's voice to create a rich sound. In the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to introduce the melody in a special way.",

And it was still there when she was 17 years old. She wanted to be with someone, not things. But she did not like any boys. Some boys liked her, but she did not feel the same way. She wondered what was wrong with her.\n\nShe thought about this a lot. She tried to think of why she felt this way. But she could not think of a good reason. So she lived her life, and kept wondering about her feelings.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm and kind. They did not argue with each other. But they did argue with their daughter sometimes. They wanted her to be more like them. She was a happy and fun person. She was very likable.\n\nToday was not a peaceful day.

            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" affects the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study found that women who followed the diet had lower risk of heart disease and stroke. \n\nThe Mediterranean Diet is a type of diet that includes a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes. It also includes more monounsaturated fat and fish, and less saturated fat and animal products. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who followed the Mediterranean Diet had lower risk of heart disease and death. However, these studies did not look at stroke specifically.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63. They were all part of a larger group of 121,700 nurses in the United States. The women answered questions about their eating habits six times over 20 years. \n\nThe researchers used this information to calculate a score that showed how well the women followed the Mediterranean Diet. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like smoking, body weight and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They compared the women who followed the diet well with those who did not, and found that the risk of heart disease and stroke was 29% lower.\n\nThis study shows that following the Mediterranean Diet can help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market also failed. Some of America's biggest companies were in trouble. We need to understand how this happened and how to prevent it in the future. \n\nThe problem started with bad decisions by leaders. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks and companies were not prepared to handle these loans. They sold these loans to other companies. When people could not pay their loans, the banks were in trouble. They had to give up a lot of money.\n\nThis problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be popular. So, he allowed banks to give more loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake. A reporter named Steven Holmes said in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give loans to people with low incomes.\" He also said, \"This could cause problems when the economy is bad.\" He was right. The economy got worse, and people lost their money.\n\nMore people were in trouble when banks gave out bad loans. They used new ways to lend money. These ways made it hard for people to understand what they were doing. When the housing market failed, the banks were in big trouble. They had a lot of debt. The government had to help them. Some banks went out of business, and others had to change the way they worked.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in big trouble. They had $5 trillion in debt. The government had to take control of them. We need to be careful with money and make good decisions to prevent this from happening again.",
            "Exposition.  That part of your story where you show your writing skills.  Or the place where your readers fall asleep.\n\nExposition is not your friend.  It is the part of your story where you tell what happened.  This is where you explain the history of your characters and the world they live in.\n\nDr. Merlin says to avoid long passages of exposition.  It is like telling your readers everything at once.  You should show your readers what is happening.\n\nA good example is in a movie or TV show.  One character tells another a lot of information about something that happened a long time ago.  This is called information dumping.\n\nIn fiction, the author does the telling.  But the author should not tell too much.  The reader wants to learn about the characters and the story as it happens.\n\nLet's look at an example.  A story says the heroine married a man, but he was killed in front of her.  The story does not just say this.  It shows how much the heroine loved her husband.  It shows how much he loved her.  This makes the reader care about the heroine and her husband.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would make the reader sad when he dies.  The reader would understand why the heroine is sad.  This makes the story more interesting.\n\nAs a writer, you need to make your story interesting.  You need to give your readers meat, not just bones.  This is called showing, not telling.\n\nSometimes it is tempting to rush past things.  But you should not.  You should take the time to make your story good.",

He is named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very sick. The police did not find the people who shot him. They are looking for clues. I think this story was too short.

            "Brothers have a special connection. It is a strong, unbreakable bond. This bond has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other in a special way. They see themselves in their brother. When things are very bad, the true nature of this bond is clear. It is either good or bad. When these feelings become strong, they can cause big problems. A part of understanding this bond is dealing with the results of these feelings. When one brother can look at the other and see himself, he sees himself as he really is. He sees himself through his actions and the results of those actions. This is where his true character is.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this connection between two brothers. The story is about two boys who go on a difficult journey. They face bitter disappointment and great pride in a big moment. Only one brother survives. The story shows how one brother feels pride. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants a brother who can run and climb trees. But his little brother, Doodle, is sick. He cannot do these things. The big brother is very sad. He even thinks about hurting his little brother. But then he sees Doodle smile. This makes him happy. This shows that he really loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about two brothers who are very different. One is strong, and the other is weak. But they are connected in a special way. This connection is shown through the actions of the big brother and the way he feels about his little brother. The story teaches us about the importance of love and family.",
            "The brain is a complex machine that helps us think and learn. As time has passed, people have used different pictures to explain how the brain works. At first, it was compared to a piece of paper, then to a written book, and now to a computer. These pictures can be helpful, but they also have limitations.\n\nThe brain takes information from our senses and changes it into electrical signals. Our senses tell us things like touch, heat, sound, and light. This information is changed into signals that the brain uses to understand the world. The brain changes this information in two ways: from simple to more complex, and from general to specific. For example, when you look at a picture of a box, the brain first sees the colors and edges of the box. Then, it uses this information to decide what you are seeing. The brain also uses what it knows about boxes to help you understand what you are seeing.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides which information is important and how much attention it needs. For example, you do not notice every single blade of grass when you look at your shoes. But you can hear your name in a loud room.\n\nThe brain stores information in different kinds of memory. There is memory for what we see, hear, and feel. There is also short-term and long-term memory. First, the brain changes information into a special form. For example, when we hear a word, the brain can change it into a picture, a sound, or a meaning. After information is stored, the brain must keep it safe. Some studies on animals show that the brain keeps information in the brain for a short time by sending electrical signals through certain brain cells.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some from computers, and some from brain science. One idea is that the brain has special groups of cells that are connected to each other. For example, if you think of a chair, your brain might connect the word \"chair\" to the word \"table,\" and then to the word \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley warns about dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. People in the story value community above the individual. They are conditioned to be happy right now. They do not think about the future or the past. The citizens are like pawns in a game. They follow one way of thinking. This way of thinking is decided by the World Controller.\n\nSome people see Huxley's work as a warning about capitalism. They think he is saying that big businesses control people and make them follow the rules. Huxley uses ideas from Marxism to show his concerns. He talks about how people are not equal. Some people are more important than others. This is like what happens in a big business.\n\nHuxley uses a word from Marxism called \"false consciousness\" to explain how people do not know the truth about their place in society. They are too busy thinking about their own needs. They do not think about the needs of others. They are controlled by the World Controller. The lower classes do not know they are being controlled. They just think they are happy and free. The upper classes know, but they do not do anything to change things. Most people just accept their place in society.\n\nIn the story, people do not have deep relationships with each other. They do not show strong emotions. They just talk about what they see on the surface. For example, they talk about how people look. This shows that Huxley is worried that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom and their chance to be themselves.\n\nThe people in the story do not question their place in society. They just follow the rules. This shows that Huxley is saying that capitalism is controlling people's lives. They do not have the power to make their own choices.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Many students, including me, know that getting around campus can be hard. My first year, I lived in East Halls, which is far from the rest of the campus. Going to classes in buildings like the Willard building, which is near the center of campus, took 25 minutes on foot. It took longer if the weather was bad, which it often was in State College. I talked to a graduate who is not much older than I am. He said that not long ago, the East Halls were far from the rest of the school. There was empty space between them. Now, this space has buildings, sports fields and apartments. As the campus gets bigger, it is harder to get from one place to another. One good way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But we need to ride bicycles and the campus needs to be friendly for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after not doing so for several years. He said, \"Bicycles are good. For a few years, it was not cool to ride a bike, but it is the best way to get around.\" Cycling is also good for your body. It is the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride a bike 30 miles or more. I now live off campus, far from the center of the campus. The smart decision I made this year was to buy a bike. I ride my bike to Thomas building for class. It takes 5 minutes if I ride fast. The problem is that Pollock Road is not always easy to ride on. There are better ways to walk, but I do not have time. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk to Thomas building. Walking would take 30-40 minutes. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models.

The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Insomnia Study: Biological and Sociocultural Models\n\nThis paper looks at the two main models of insomnia: the biological and sociocultural models. The biological model focuses on genetic information and medical aspects of health. The sociocultural model looks at environmental relationships and how they affect race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be primary, related to another mental disorder, or caused by other issues. There are different types of insomnia. The primary sleep disorders are called Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with sleeping or staying asleep. Parasomnias are sleep disorders that involve behavioral or physical problems.\n\nThe biological model of insomnia looks at things like genes and the brain. A study found that a group of nerve cells in the brain called orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. This study was done on mice. The study found that a type of protein in these nerve cells helps control sleep. If this protein is not working correctly, it can cause problems with sleep. This study implies that genes can affect sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model of insomnia looks at how environment can affect sleep. For example, people from different racial and ethnic groups may have different sleep patterns. People from different economic backgrounds may also have different sleep patterns. A person's sleep can be affected by their genetics, their environment, and their lifestyle.\n\nA study found that a type of medicine called baclofen can help people sleep. This medicine works by acting on a type of protein in the brain. This study suggests that the biological model of insomnia is correct. If a person has a genetic problem that affects their sleep, they may need medicine to help them sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model of insomnia also suggests that environment can affect sleep. For example, people who are poor may have trouble sleeping because they are worried about money. People who are from a different culture may have different sleep patterns. A person's sleep can be affected by many things, including their environment and their lifestyle.\n\nIn conclusion, the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia are two different ways of looking at the same problem. The biological model looks at genes and the brain. The sociocultural model looks at environment and lifestyle. Both models are important for understanding insomnia.",
            "What is Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD)?\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. It is not a hearing problem. When we have a hearing problem, we cannot hear sounds. But people with CAPD can hear sounds. The problem is with the brain. The brain does not work correctly to understand what we hear.\n\nThe brain is the control center of the body. It helps us understand what we see and hear. For people with CAPD, the brain does not work well to separate words and other sounds. They have trouble hearing in noisy places.\n\nWhat is the history of CAPD?\n\nCAPD was first mentioned in the 1950s. Doctors were trying to understand children with communication problems. They were looking for ways to test these children. In 1954, some doctors started testing children with CAPD. In 1961, they found a way to test how the brain works when we hear two things at the same time.\n\nHow does CAPD affect people?\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble with many things. They may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. They may not understand sounds that are in a pattern. They may not know what someone means by a change in voice. They may block one sound with another sound. They may not understand sounds in the right order.\n\nHow is CAPD diagnosed?\n\nWe diagnose CAPD by looking at how a person listens and acts when they hear things. We use many tests to see if a person has CAPD. These tests are not always the same, and we do not know the cause of CAPD.\n\nWhat can a teacher do to help a student with CAPD?\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in many ways. They can provide a quiet place for the student to work. They can help the student to listen carefully. They can show the student how to repeat words and sounds. They can help the student to understand what they hear. They can be patient and understanding. They can help the student to learn and succeed.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be useful for deceiving people. But, in the end, it can be hard to stop using a disguise. If you keep using one, you may lose yourself. The problem is that stopping a deception can cause trouble. You may feel alone and separated from people you care about. Some people may not be upset when they find out they were tricked. Others will be angry and hurt.\n\nThe play makes us think about why people use disguises, especially when they pretend to be the opposite sex. In Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself from harm. She is good at acting like a man, but it makes her feel alone and separate from the women around her. She also has feelings for two people, Orsino and Olivia. Orsino is the man who loves Viola, but Viola is afraid to tell him the truth. Olivia falls in love with Viola, who is pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play shows how using a disguise can make people see their true feelings. Olivia and Orsino may have feelings for each other, but they do not show them because of Viola's disguise. This makes us wonder if people's feelings are truly what they seem. Is Olivia in love with Viola because she is a man, or does she really have feelings for women? The play does not give us a clear answer.\n\nThe play suggests that people may be attracted to people who look a certain way, not just because of who they are. This is shown when Olivia easily falls in love with Sebastian, who looks like Viola. This makes us think about how people judge others based on how they look.",
            "The German government ruled many lands outside of Germany. This government was known for its unfair and cruel treatment of people. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. However, the German government was not always unfair. It supported education in some of its colonies. \n\nIn East Africa, the British found many Africans who could read and write when they took control of the area in 1919. German schools in Kamerun and other colonies were also good. \n\nBut South West Africa was different. The government in this area did not do much to help Africans get an education. Instead, it relied on missionary groups to teach the local people. The government built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools. But the Africans in South West Africa did not have the same opportunities. Most of them could not read or write.\n\nThe German government spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in South West Africa. This had a big effect on the area even after the Germans left. Other German colonies had many educated Africans, but South West Africa was different. Many Africans in this area did not have an education.\n\nWe need to study why this happened. This paper will look at the reasons and the attitudes of the people who lived in South West Africa.\n\nThere is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of the information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of these sources compare education in different colonies. They show that each colony had its own system of education. One study compares South West Africa and East Africa. The writer of this study says that the number of white people in South West Africa was the reason for its different education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate and many white people lived there by 1913. But the African population did not have the same opportunities. The number of white people in South West Africa was higher than in other German colonies.",
            "Heavy Metal Music: A Growing Genre\n\nHeavy metal music has changed a lot over the last 100 years. Many kinds of metal music exist today, making it hard to list them all. Also, most metal music styles have smaller groups, or sub-genres, within them. Heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive metal music styles. It shows a wide range of feelings, usually on the darker side.\n\nThis music style started to grow and change about 40 years ago. People began to see that heavy metal had a lot of possibilities and started to create their own sub-genres. This led to even smaller groups, or sub-sub-genres, and it continues to grow today.\n\nNow, we have many different kinds of heavy metal groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal really is. But to understand the heavy metal music that is popular today, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy metal is known for its strong and dark sound. It often has a lot of power, a lot of loud music and a lot of energy. People who play heavy metal music are usually very good at their instruments. This is clear in the music. Heavy metal is also a movement that is connected to drug use. In the 1970s, many people used psychedelic drugs, which made them create crazy and different music. This music had a lot of dark and powerful qualities that were new to the music world. Some later groups took their ideas from the dark and powerful qualities of the Romantic Era.\n\nMany songs in heavy metal express the dark side of life. These songs show that heavy metal is a music style that is connected to the darker side of life. One good example of this is the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. This song shows the ups and downs of drug use and is considered one of the first heavy metal songs. It was made in response to a similar song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau and his Dream\n.\n\nBefore the famous Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was creating his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His painting, The Dream, made in 1910, shows a woman in wonder at the beauty of the land she visits in a dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted recognition, approval, and praise from other artists and art lovers. But he had a big problem: he was not sure if he should follow the styles of others or be himself.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France on May 21, 1844. His father was a hardware dealer. Rousseau grew up and got a job with the government when he was young. He worked there for 40 years. He got no special training in art, but he started painting when he was older. His first wife and many of their children died. He felt sad and wanted a new life. So, he started painting to feel better.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time, Rousseau was not a romantic painter. He was a folk painter who wanted to make art like regular people. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he was not sure how to do it. He was not educated in art and started painting late in life. Many other artists were already famous when he began to make a name for himself. It was not until around the same time that another famous artist, Matisse, was becoming well-known that Rousseau started to get recognition.\n\nThe artist Jan Gordon wrote that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was simple and easy to understand, so people would like his art. Matisse, on the other hand, did not want to paint in a way that was boring or common.",
            "Many smart people think there is a strong connection between what is good and what is beautiful. I agree with this idea. It makes sense to me. John Keats says in a poem, \"Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. That is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life from education and experience. But we seem to understand what is good and what is beautiful without being taught. Both what is good and what is beautiful are attempts to explain why something is good or why something is beautiful. We do not make a list of rules to decide what is good or what is beautiful.\n\nIn fact, it is hard to fully explain why a painting is good art or why an action is a good action. We can talk about the colors in a painting, or the way the artist used light and shadow. But these things do not explain why a painting is good. When we talk about a favorite painting, we often say \"There's just something about it.\" This is because there is something more to good art and good actions that we cannot explain.\n\nI think that art and good actions have this same quality. Flannery O'Connor says that a story is a way to say something that cannot be said in any other way. No matter how much we describe a story, there is something more that remains. I believe that what is good also has this quality. The German philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein says that what is good cannot be expressed. It is beyond words.\n\nI think that what is good and what is beautiful are connected because they both touch us deeply. We feel them at a level that is hard to explain. This connection is even stronger when it comes to stories. What makes a story good is its moral value. It is the values that we find in a story that make it important to us. Living involves making choices and decisions based on values. Stories help us understand these values and make them important to us.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united and has its own special culture. This culture is from many different people who came to Germany long ago. Some came from the mountains near München, while others came from the city of Kiel near the Baltic Sea.\n\nYou can feel this culture in many places in Germany. It is in the city of Köln on the Rhine River, in the center of Germany, and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River. So, it is not surprising that Germany has a mix of cultures from different people and tribes.\n\nThe land where the Germans live is called Germania. The name \"Germany\" is not clear. Some people think it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from the Gauls, who lived in a different area. They called the Germans \"Germanus\" because they were different from them.\n\nThe Romans knew the Germans well. They fought many battles with them. The Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his history book. He said they were a strong and noisy people who lived beyond the Rhine River. They fought with the Gauls, who lived near the Rhine.\n\nSome people think the name \"Germany\" came from a special spear the Germans used in battle. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This could mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said they were the original people of Germany and did not come from other countries. He said they were a strong and proud people who did not want to leave their land.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany, but they traded with the Germans and fought battles with them. The Germans traded goods and skills with the Romans, and some even served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down and saw nothing in my mind.  The view before me was just a picture.  I did not think about the picture.  I just looked at it.  Thoughts came and went quickly.  My mind was active, but I did not think deeply.  \n\nI learned to draw from a book.  The book was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I wanted to be an artist since I was six years old.  The book teaches about pencils and how the brain sees lines.  One technique is to draw a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simpler.  \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table.  I could not imagine drawing a square around it.  I was too busy looking at it.  I was amazed.  I wanted to be an artist like Picasso, who used blue colors, or Monet, who loved green.  I wanted my picture, called \"Work in Brown,\" to be great.  \n\nI picked up my pencil.  My hand moved to the paper.  My mind was ready to create.  I started to draw.  But my hand moved to the toilet handle.  Something was stuck.  I tried to fix it.  I used a mop to clean up the mess.  It was a hard job.  Finally, I was able to get rid of the problem.  I was ready to create again.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several things contribute to this problem. One reason is that young brains are not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers have not had much experience. This lack of experience causes more accidents and more serious problems like driving off the road or speeding.\n\nYoung drivers do worse when they have friends in the car. Most young drivers drive with friends. A study showed that the age of the passenger and the number of accidents are connected.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for young drivers. They require special licenses that limit the hours they can drive and say they cannot drive with other young people in the car.\n\nI think these special licenses are not enough. The problem is that young drivers are not ready to handle the risks of driving. Some experts think it is too early to give a regular license to anyone under 19 or 20 years old. This age group likes to take risks for the fun of it. It makes sense to wait until this desire to take risks goes away. If we continue to give licenses to young teens, many more accidents will happen. The number of young drivers will grow in a few years, and the number of accidents will also grow.\n\nA simple solution is to make a law that no one under 18 can drive. Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can get a license. A special permit can still be given before a full license, and a certain number of practice hours are still required. This is the same as most states. This law will save many lives and prevent many accidents.\n\nThis idea is not new. Many people think it is a good idea.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I watched all trick films made by Thomas Edison from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of these films. Trick films use editing to create illusions. I studied these films to understand their storytelling and camera work. Most trick films from this time are set in a single place. The camera does not move, and the shots are long and medium length. The films follow a rule: one shot equals one film. However, some films from the early 1900s break this rule.\n\nOne thing that all trick films have in common is that they were filmed in a single set. The camera did not move to follow people or objects. This style comes from theater and vaudeville shows. The camera was fixed in one place. People in the films only moved side to side, not towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" actors enter from one side and move back and forth.\n\nTrick films mostly use long and some medium shots. They do not use close-up shots. This is because the theater and vaudeville tradition shows the whole performance at one time. Actors did not move towards the camera, so close-ups were not used.\n\nMost trick films are short, about a minute or less. They are like short vaudeville tricks that show magic or disappearing acts. However, some trick films use many small shots to create an illusion. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a close look shows that the \"head\" is actually a separate shot. The filmmakers joined many small shots together to create a single illusion.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas. He was a farmer, but his work in politics made him known for his strong opinions on personal freedom and government. Taylor believed that the best system of government is based on farming. His ideas about government were influenced by his work on farms.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a chance to create the perfect system of government. This was because the country was new and had no old traditions to follow. This allowed the creators of the government to make a system of self-government. Taylor believed in the rights of all people. He thought these rights are connected and important for everyone. If one right is taken away, it weakens all the other rights. He said the government should not be able to take away these rights.\n\nTaylor believed that in a natural state, people with power and evil intentions do well. But in a society, this should not be true. He thought a good government must understand the good and bad in people. Taylor believed that government is like people. It has virtues and vices. He said good principles are those that protect private property, help farming, and reduce capitalism. He thought a government based on good principles would work fairly, even if its leaders are selfish.\n\nTaylor wanted a limited government with few powers. He thought the federal government should only have the powers listed in the Constitution. He knew a strong federal government is expensive and may be cruel. But he also thought a simple, strict interpretation of the Constitution could be bad. He believed we need to understand the writers' intentions when they made the Constitution. Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States. It explains that the country is a group of states, not just one nation.",
            "We look at Figure 17, and see a big drop in people sending in their commuter log information in the third month of the project. This is not good news, and it's hard to understand why it happened. Winter arrived at our New England school, and this time of year fewer people walk or ride their bicycles to campus. This might be part of the reason for the drop in submissions. December is also the end of the fall school term. Students and teachers are busy finishing their work and getting ready for winter break. They might not have time to fill out the commuter log. The winter break is a month long, and many people do not have to come to school. When classes start again in late January, we see a decrease in the number of logs submitted again. This is not a good sign. We created a special week in March called Carpool Challenge Week to try and get people more interested in the project again. This effort was successful, and more people sent in their logs that month. So, we face challenges in keeping people engaged in the project. There are natural reasons for this, such as the holidays and school breaks. We also have a big problem: people like to drive their cars. This is a part of our culture. To get people to try other ways of getting to school, we need incentives. We offered prizes like gift certificates to local stores and restaurants. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bike or a new car. This might have kept people more interested in the project.",
            "An ETF is a special kind of investment. It is like a fund that follows a group of stocks, a product, or a mix of investments. But it is more flexible and trades like a single stock on a market.\n\nAn ETF gives you the advantage of a group of stocks and the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy with borrowed money, and buy as few shares as one. These benefits are very attractive. But ETFs have some costs, like paying a fee for every trade, just like buying a stock. There are also many kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nTo understand ETFs, we will look at the ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to know if owning one ETF is like owning a group of ten stocks. We also want to know if there is a better way to choose these same stocks.\n\nWe cannot look at all the stocks in the ETF. So we will look at the top 10 stocks, which make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 stocks and the percentage of the ETF they make up.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will use a special calculation. We will look at how these stocks would do if we had a portfolio of just these 10 stocks. We will compare this to the ETF.\n\nThe chart below shows the results. We can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks would make 6.11% more than the ETF. It would also have a lower risk, or Beta, of 0.12. This means that the top 10 stocks could provide a higher return with less risk.\n\nBut we need to be sure that these results are not just a coincidence. We need to see if the difference between the two portfolios is real. To do this, we will look at the standard deviation of each stock. We will compare this to the standard deviation of the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem, Dream-Land, is one of his important works. Poe uses a word called \"Thulé\" twice at the beginning and end of the poem. This word is from a place in ancient stories. The ancient Greeks thought it was the edge of the world.\n\nPoe was interested in the writings of a German author named Goethe. Some people think Poe took ideas from Goethe's writing. A writer named Karl J. Arndt wrote about the similarity between Poe's poem \"Politian\" and Goethe's poem \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe is famous for writing a play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king whose wife dies. He then drinks heavily and cries because he misses his wife. He decides it is time for him to die and gives his things to his children. He then goes to a cliff, throws a special cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in this poem is like the man in Poe's Dream-Land. They both drink too much and are very sad.\n\nGoethe's poem \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's Dream-Land can be read together. In Dream-Land, the speaker says he is in a dark and lonely place. He sees a world without color and is haunted by dead friends. These ideas are also in \"The King of Thulé.\" The king in \"The King of Thulé\" just lost his wife and is also lonely and sad.\n\nGoethe was a well-known writer, and Poe would have known his work. Poe liked another writer named Tennyson. Poe said he admired Tennyson. Poe would have also known Goethe's work because many of his writings were copied and printed after the original publication.",
            "In California, a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on spilled applesauce in a grocery store can ask for extra money damages from the store. This is because the store manager knew about the spill twice and did not clean it for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner at the time.\n\nThe customer, Jennifer Palmer, has a good chance of winning her claim for extra damages. To win this claim, she must show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with mean and selfish behavior. He must have known that not cleaning the spill would hurt someone. The court will probably not throw out her claim right away.\n\nPalmer can say that Martin should have known the spill would hurt someone because many other customers had slipped and fallen in the store in the past. Even after that, Martin still did not clean the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's behavior was mean is not very strong, but it is still a good point. Many customers had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009, and Martin did not take action to keep the store safe.\n\nOn one day in October 2009, an employee of the store, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill. Martin said he was on break and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Another employee, Mary Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt badly.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra damages if the other person acted with bad behavior. The law says this happens when the person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is when the person intended to hurt someone, or when they did something very bad and knew it would hurt someone, but they did it anyway.\n\nIn this case, the judge will decide if Martin acted with malice. If he did, Palmer can get extra damages.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One big question we talked about was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is still very important today.  Since 9/11, I have seen how the media has changed its view of Islam.  It used to be mostly negative.  Now it is very tolerant.  In 2001, I do not think Americans would have voted for a president with a name like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam.\n\nI read the biography of Muhammad. It is interesting.  I learned that Muhammad was not a strong leader who forced people to be Muslim.  Instead, he was a kind person who showed people the truth through his words and actions.  People came to him because they believed in him.  This is different from what I thought I knew about Muhammad.\n\nI also see some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the life of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food and drink for many people.  The writer of the biography wants Muhammad to be seen as a humble and kind person.  But this can take away from the greatness of Jesus.  It is like taking credit for someone else's work.  I think this is not right.\n\nI do not like it when the biography tells stories that are not true.  Sometimes the stories are secondhand.  The writer heard from someone else who heard from someone else.  This makes the stories seem less believable.\n\nI have a problem with how the biography presents Muhammad.  The writer says he was a kind and wise person.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's life.",
            "Jesus' teachings and ideas are no longer the main part of Christian thought today.  This happened after his death.  If we look at Christian history, we see a trend.  It is a trend of Christianity moving away from its start.  Many people today are becoming more aware of this.  They want to go back to the ideas Jesus taught.  They want to know what he really said.  This movement will grow.  It will become bigger and stronger.  People want to know what Jesus' ideas were.  They want to know the real meaning of Christianity.  It may take a long time, but it will happen.  The Christian church will go back to its original form.  People will forget about the ideas added to the religion.  They will learn what Jesus said about God.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will think and believe the same way.  The Christian church will still be strong.  But people will be more alike in their thinking.  There will be less difference between different groups of Christians.  This has happened before in history.  The Roman Empire used to be against Christians.  But later, it became Christian.  Our country used to treat African-Americans badly.  But now they have leaders.  This change is coming to the Christian church.  It will be a big change.  To understand what Jesus said, people will have to think about his words as symbols, not as facts.\n\nLooking far back in history, we see only one main idea:  the Jewish religion.  This was the idea that started Christianity.  The Jewish people had many different groups.  They did not all agree on one thing.  They had the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and many more.",

The leaders of big companies are a good example. They want to make a lot of money and make their companies bigger. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way.\n\nThe book describes the big factories. They are black and have big chimneys that send out bad smoke. The smoke hurts people and animals. The leaders do not care about this. They also do not care about the animals in the pens. The pens are dirty and have animal waste. \n\nThe leaders also do not care about their workers. They work long hours and do not get paid much. The leaders can fire them at any time without giving them help finding a new job. The workers live in bad conditions and are very poor. They are treated like slaves. The book says they are as helpless as slaves were in the past.\n\nThe system in the book is not fair. The workers have no protection. They cannot get help or information. Some groups, called unions, are supposed to help the workers, but they often make money from the poor workers. This makes the workers' lives worse.\n\nThe book shows that many people in this situation are not able to take care of themselves. They are very poor and have no chance to escape.",
            "Many writers use special ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. \nF. Scott Fitzgerald uses these special ways in his book The Great Gatsby. \nSome of his techniques are very effective. He often puts two words together that do not usually go together to give readers a certain feeling about a subject. \nFitzgerald does this with many colors, including gold, green, white, and gray. He builds up meaning for these colors and then uses them to make readers feel a certain way.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show that something is not special or important. \nAt first, the book describes many people wearing white and gray. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt. Daisy and Jordan are often dressed in white. Fitzgerald also uses these colors to describe ordinary things. The streets of New York are like white chasms. The cars and land in a valley are gray.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show that something is not special. He uses them to make readers feel that something is common or usual. This happens with Daisy. Fitzgerald describes her as dressed in white and gray. Readers start to see her as not a special person, but just a part of Gatsby's life.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors many times in the book to show that some people and things are not special.

These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a big market for food grown without chemicals. Many people in San Diego want to buy this kind of food. Some local groups have long lists of people waiting to buy organic food. People also like to buy organic eggs and milk.\n\nSome farms in San Diego give tours of their farms. People can walk or ride horses on the farms. They can also watch birds and other animals.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps animals and plants in the area. But it can be harder and more expensive than farming with chemicals. Farmers must work harder to remove pests and weeds. They must also use special methods to make the soil healthy without chemicals. \n\nThe area near the town of Potrero in California is good for farming. It has chaparral, grassland, and oak trees. It is next to the Cleveland National Forest. Many plants and animals live there. Some are in danger and need protection. The area was once home to Native Americans and later was used for cattle and wood.\n\nI looked at a piece of land and found government programs that can help small farmers. A local farm is an example of what someone can do on this land. They can grow food without chemicals and help the environment.",
            "Culture plays a very important role in any negotiation. Culture is not the same for everyone. It is not one thing or one idea. It can be different in many ways. We should not say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too broad and not very accurate.\n\nTo be a good negotiator, we need to understand what culture means in a specific situation. We need to know how a culture can help or hurt the negotiation. When we meet a new culture, we should think about how it is like or different from our own culture. We should try to learn about the culture's history and what it values.\n\nInstead of judging a culture, we should accept it for what it is. We should respect its traditions and beliefs. This can help us get past any problems and move the negotiation forward. If we are in a weaker position, showing respect can be especially helpful.\n\nCulture is not just about countries or nations. A company can have its own culture. For example, some companies value hard work, while others value work-life balance. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they make decisions. Even within the same country, different companies can have very different cultures.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell us why people in a culture behave in certain ways. If saving face is important, people will not want to lose face in a negotiation. If a culture values hard work, people will not want to give up easily. Before a negotiation, we should think about these things. We should also try to learn about our opponent's values and personality to be successful.",
            "A famous Bible verse says: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. It is also in the beginning of an argument by St. Anselm about God's existence. Thomas Aquinas believes the same thing. Their arguments are about the same idea, so we will compare them. We will start by assuming they are both right about God.\n\nThis God is the one in the Bible. If we talk about a different kind of god, we can't compare their arguments. They are trying to prove the same kind of God. So, we will look at their ideas. \n\nSt. Anselm's idea is that we can know God just by thinking. He says if we know something, we can't think about it not existing. This is a bit hard to understand, but the main idea is that God's existence is in our minds. We don't need outside evidence to know God. This is like faith in the Bible. It's not about proof, but about believing something because it feels true.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can know God by using reason and looking at the world. He doesn't need faith. He says we can use five different ideas to prove God's existence. These are change, cause, need, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He says we can know God is real just by thinking about these things.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. His name would one day be Buddha. He lived a long life and became a wise leader. He taught people important ideas, and his teachings led to the creation of Buddhism.\n\nToday, Buddhism is a very old religion, about twenty-five hundred years old. It has changed over time. You can see this in the country of Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, people celebrate a special water-cutting ceremony every year. Many people, both monks and laypeople, take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about this celebration.\n\nBuddhism has changed in many ways. This is true for both monks and laypeople. The ideas of Buddhism have been different over time. This is because of forces both inside and outside the Buddhist community. These forces are either friendly or not friendly to Buddhism.\n\nThere are some important words to know for this discussion. An internal force is a force from inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a force from people who are not Buddhist. A hostile force hurts the Buddhist community. A friendly force does not hurt or help the Buddhist community. These words will be used often in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basics of Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, three groups of Buddhist texts. These texts tell us about the Buddha's teachings. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has many teachings from the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka tells us rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka explains the meaning of life and death. It tells us that everything is not permanent and that we have no soul. This is important to understanding Buddhism.\n\nBuddhists also follow the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome. These truths are very important in Buddhism.",
            "Many years ago, the United States and Mexico were enemies. They fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and took some land from Mexico. This event made the two countries have a long-lasting problem.\n\nThey had many small fights over the years. The problem started because of different ideas about religion, culture, and tradition. The two countries also had different interests.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have disagreements. The United States and Mexico are not alone. Many other countries have problems with their neighbors.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher said that the United States has had big problems with only two countries: Mexico and Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States.\n\nThe two countries had a big disagreement about religion. The United States did not like the Mexican Catholic church. This caused a problem between the two countries for a long time.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not get along because of the English and Spanish. These countries had a long time ago. The US and Mexico liked or disliked the same things because of this.\n\nThe US and Mexico had 17 big disagreements between 1836 and 1893. Most of these disagreements were about land. Some people from Mexico would cross the border and take things from the US. The US and Mexico had to use force to stop these problems.\n\nEventually, the US and Mexico became friends. Mexico needed the US for help, and the US stopped trying to take its land. This made the two countries stop being enemies.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got sick and could not move. This was a surprise. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job because it seemed safe. People will always be sick, and I could always find work.\n\nI wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing because it was safe. I was 46 years old and had no money. I could not work. Today, I still have a problem moving. I get money from the government because I am sick. But I have no money for myself.\n\nI have to work hard every day. I am not safe and I am not happy. I do not know what will happen tomorrow. But I know that my family and friends helped me. They helped me when I was weak.\n\nMy point is that bad things happen in life. We cannot control everything. We need to help each other. We need to ask for help. We should not just depend on the government.\n\nSome people in the US think we should not depend on the government. But I think we should help each other. We should be kind to each other. Our ancestors were not alone. They helped each other. They shared food and supplies. They worked together.\n\nWe should be prepared for bad things. I have a box with food and water. I have a first aid kit and a way to make water clean. I have a light and candles. But we also need to know our neighbors. We need to be kind to each other.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time in the way they do. Are there rules that control how they change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that even now, biologists do not know how to use math to describe the simplest living things. Even today, this is still true.\n\nRecently, people have used math to understand how some animals build their skeletons. They studied how animals develop their skeletons over time (ontogeny) and how their skeletons change over many generations (phylogeny). Our study is exploring how math can help us understand how animals change their skeletons.\n\nWe used special pictures of a type of shellfish to understand how its skeleton changes. We looked at the pictures and found numbers that can be used to model how the shellfish skeleton changes. We entered these numbers into a computer program to create new shell shapes. These new shapes can help us understand the limits of how the shellfish skeleton can change.\n\nWe can think of a shell as a tube that grows over time. The shell grows in a spiral shape, like a snake. Each part of the spiral is called a whorl. The whorls grow around a center point. The center point is called the columella. The shell grows in different ways, and a line separates each whorl. This line is called a suture.\n\nThe largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The rest of the whorls are called the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can see shells in four different ways: from the top, bottom, front, and back. The usual way to see a shell is from the front, with the opening facing us and the top pointing up.\n\nWe can count the whorls by looking at the shell from the top and finding the first line. Then, we draw a line and count the whorls from that line. We can estimate the number of whorls to a quarter.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it builds its shell. We can find the path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the opening. We can draw a picture of the path and use math to understand how the shell grows.\n\nOnce we understand how the shell grows, we can change the numbers and see how the shell would change. This can help us understand how animals change over time.",
            "Indonesia's baby and young child death rates have not changed much in ten years. The country is making progress in some areas, like water and sanitation. However, the country is not doing well in meeting the goals for better health and care for mothers and children. The reasons for this are many and will be explained below. These reasons show that Indonesia's health system needs to be improved, not just individual programs.\n\nMore mothers are getting help from a trained health worker when they give birth. Seventy-two percent of births now have this help. However, this number includes traditional workers like midwives who may not have the training to help in emergencies. This means that many mothers are still at risk. In addition, fewer children with diarrhea are getting treated by a health professional. We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being cared for after giving birth. The numbers are not good across the country.\n\nNot enough mothers are having C-sections, which are operations to help with difficult births. The number of C-sections is only four percent. This number is low. It also shows another problem. In cities, seven percent of mothers have C-sections. But in rural areas, the number is only two percent. This shows that city areas have more access to good healthcare. Another problem is that poor people have less access to healthcare. There is a big difference in how many people use healthcare services between the poorest and richest families. This is because poor families have to pay for healthcare out of their own money.\n\nTo fix the problems with baby and mother care, we need to ask how to make healthcare services more available. Should Indonesia develop special programs or improve the overall healthcare system? There is no question that special programs can be helpful. They have clear goals and can make progress faster. However, there are some problems with this approach. One problem is that spending a lot of money on one area can mean that other areas get less money. This can make it hard for healthcare workers to choose where to work. Another problem is that many programs can be uncoordinated and lead to extra paperwork and waste.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed stories about the rich people of the time.  Two books that are considered Victorian but are different from this kind are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting.  This makes the characters more believable and shows what they are thinking and feeling.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to Oliver.  He sees and hears things that are not real.  This shows what is happening inside Oliver's mind.  He is worried and scared.  When Oliver is shot, he remembers it later like it was a dream.  He is very sick and can't control what is happening to him.\n\nOliver feels he has no control over his life.  He can't even try to save himself when he is in danger.  This shows that Oliver is losing hope.  He is starting to give up.  He feels defeated.  He is trapped in a world where he is not in control.\n\nWuthering Heights is another book that uses mystery and strange events.  The day and night are like a dream.  They are very long and very short.  This shows how confusing and scary the world can be.\n\nThese two books are different from other Victorian novels.  They use strange and mysterious events to make the characters more believable and interesting.  They show what is happening inside the characters' minds and how they are feeling.",
            "I worked with students after school two years ago. I helped them with their school work, but I was good at helping with English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I thought something was strange. Some letters he could read easily, but others he could not read at all. Adrian spoke very good English, but he was from a Latino family. I was helping to take care of the other students when Adrian's mother came to the after-school program. She did not speak English. We used a little Spanish to communicate. I then understood that Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. I do not know if this helped him, but I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about the problem of language barriers in schools, especially in California. I also tell it to show that the problem is not always clear. Even a student who speaks good English can still have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was to teach him the English alphabet and how to pronounce words. For students who do not speak much English, the answer is more complex. There is no one answer. We need to use many methods: dual language programs, mainstream education, private tutors, and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.\n\nI think dual language programs are a good idea. They are not just for students who speak Spanish, but for all students. Studies show that students in these programs do better in school. Many people are afraid that this will waste money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use these programs more often, all students will benefit. So, how can we do this? Do we need to make all teachers bilingual? No, that is not possible. However, we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "When we are young, people often tell us about something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it, while others visit the temple or search inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religions given to them by their parents. But some reject them completely. They do not believe there is something beyond what they know in their own world. They may choose one value system, then change it for another. We all try to understand a part of ourselves in our own way.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our front porch. He said his favorite bird was the cardinal. We listened to the rain on the tin roof. The rain came from the gutters and drowned the plants near the porch. My father looked out into the rain. He seemed to be thinking and remembering. He was thinner and looked weak. His hair was thin and sparse. He did not look at me. I felt sad and afraid. I could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. If I did, it would make it more real. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out into the rain together.\n\nMy father died five days after my twenty-second birthday in December. He had cancer. The treatment did not ease his pain, but it kept him alive a little longer than the doctors said. What was the point, I thought? If God existed, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. I did not want to see the man who created me go away. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive, not when he was sick. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting for the news. But no one called me.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a strange mix of old and new ideas. This is how Ian Watt describes it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel\". The Gothic style has been praised and blamed. Some people say it has no real meaning. Others say it is great because it creates a sense of fear and excitement. The first \"Gothic Novel\" was written by Horace Walpole. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto\". Walpole used ideas from old stories and new ways of writing to create a new style. He used old theater and modern ideas to write a story that was new.\n\nThe Gothic style uses many old ideas from medieval times. These ideas came from theater, architecture, and traditions. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things. It was seen as old-fashioned in a world that valued progress and new ideas.\n\nThe combination of the old and the new is what makes the Gothic style stay interesting for a long time. It is like a new and old thing at the same time.\n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic stories is the idea of chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a knight to be brave and honorable. This idea is important in Gothic stories because it represents a time when people believed in chivalry. The writer, Horace Walpole, was unhappy with the world he lived in. He wanted to show that the good qualities of the past were missing in the present. He used the idea of chivalry to make the past seem better than the present.\n\nIn the story, there is a character named Frederic. He is a prince who has suffered in the past. He is described as a brave and chivalrous knight. He is a good example of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that people used to idealize. The writer is exaggerating this image to show that the qualities of the past are not present in the present.",
            "Supply Chain Management\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the raw materials and then to the customer. This process includes production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Supply chain management is used by managers of businesses to give good service to customers.\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These six parts help businesses give the best service to customers.\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base of the whole supply chain. Managers must know what customers want. To know what customers want, managers look at the market. The market shows what customers need. Once managers understand customer needs, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory will make the most and best products. Managers think about customer needs and satisfaction when making these decisions.\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on work schedules and equipment maintenance. Production is a very important step in the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned carefully, the company will waste time and money.\n\nExample: I used to work at Walmart and Target. Both companies have a plan for every part of the business. They have a plan for how employees should dress and how to receive shipments from trucks. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly without confusion.\n\nSupply is the second key part of the supply chain. Supply means making decisions about what skills a factory should have and which companies to partner with. A company may have many different factories for one product. Each factory has different equipment, workers, and skills. Managers decide which factory is best for each part of the product. They may also decide to work with other companies. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps companies make good products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "A message in Burma says Hitler is alive. \nEllen Page, an actress from America, holds a sign that says this on a street corner. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strong group of military leaders. They took control of the country in nineteen sixty-two. In two thousand seven, many people in Burma protested on the streets. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. They were led by Buddhist monks who wear orange robes. Many people in Burma began to support the protests. But the government started to use violence against the monks. They attacked monasteries and arrested journalists who came to report on the protests. One journalist was killed in September of that year.\n\nBad things have happened in Burma before. The government there has always tried to control its people. In the past, some leaders thought they were chosen by gods to rule. In another country, Japan, leaders were believed to be gods who came to help their people. In the United States, a president had meetings with a leader of a group that does not like freedom. \n\nThere have been big protests in many countries. In China, many people protested in nineteen eighty-nine. They did not want the government to rule them. Many people died in this protest. In Rwanda, a group of people killed others because of their color or their ideas. In Germany, a long time ago, a man named Hitler killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington's work in jazz is very important because he lived a long time and could keep creating music. His piano playing is not always easy to hear in many of the songs he composed, but as a composer, he was great at writing songs that let the band members show off their talents. Ellington created a framework for musicians to improvise. He also wrote tightly organized pieces that used the special style of each musician to bring out their musical ideas. This way, he created new and original sounds to fit each song. Ellington knew how to get the best sound from each musician and how to put them together to make a great band. This helped him write some of the most innovative and excellent jazz music in history.\n\nA music dictionary, The Grove Music dictionary, talks about Ellington's style and his new ideas. It mentions a song called Creole Love Call. This song is an early example of Ellington using the human voice as a musical instrument. He did this throughout his career. The song is a slow, 12-bar blues. It has six parts: \n\nPart 1: The singer and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The singer starts with a smooth sound, then gets rougher at the end.\n\nPart 2: A muted trumpet player plays a solo that makes the basic melody sound better. He emphasizes some long notes.\n\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays very high notes. The piano player adds a special rhythm to the music.\n\nPart 4: The whole band repeats part 1. The brass and woodwind sections talk to each other.\n\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start talking to each other. The brass and rhythm sections play a special rhythm.\n\nPart 6: This part is like part 1. The singer starts to sound like a musical instrument. The singer uses a special technique called \"growl\" to sound like an instrument.\n\nThe song ends with a short part that includes a vocal run and a strange sound from a trombone.\n\nEllington was very good at using the human voice to add color to his music. This is just one example of his style.\n\nIn the song Hot and Bothered, Ellington combines his skill at writing tight rhythms with his ability to hear the special sound of each musician. A singer and a trumpeter play a phrase together. The singer uses the vocal parts of the trumpet player's music and the trumpet player uses the vocal parts of the singer's voice to create a rich sound. In the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to introduce the melody in a special way.",

The study found that women who followed the diet had lower risk of heart disease and stroke. \n\nThe Mediterranean Diet is a type of diet that includes a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes. It also includes more monounsaturated fat and fish, and less saturated fat and animal products. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who followed the Mediterranean Diet had lower risk of heart disease and death. However, these studies did not look at stroke specifically.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63. They were all part of a larger group of 121,700 nurses in the United States. The women answered questions about their eating habits six times over 20 years. \n\nThe researchers used this information to calculate a score that showed how well the women followed the Mediterranean Diet. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like smoking, body weight and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They compared the women who followed the diet well with those who did not, and found that the risk of heart disease and stroke was 29% lower.\n\nThis study shows that following the Mediterranean Diet can help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market also failed. Some of America's biggest companies were in trouble. We need to understand how this happened and how to prevent it in the future. \n\nThe problem started with bad decisions by leaders. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks and companies were not prepared to handle these loans. They sold these loans to other companies. When people could not pay their loans, the banks were in trouble. They had to give up a lot of money.\n\nThis problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be popular. So, he allowed banks to give more loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake. A reporter named Steven Holmes said in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give loans to people with low incomes.\" He also said, \"This could cause problems when the economy is bad.\" He was right. The economy got worse, and people lost their money.\n\nMore people were in trouble when banks gave out bad loans. They used new ways to lend money. These ways made it hard for people to understand what they were doing. When the housing market failed, the banks were in big trouble. They had a lot of debt. The government had to help them. Some banks went out of business, and others had to change the way they worked.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in big trouble. They had $5 trillion in debt. The government had to take control of them. We need to be careful with money and make good decisions to prevent this from happening again.",
            "Exposition.  That part of your story where you show your writing skills.  Or the place where your readers fall asleep.\n\nExposition is not your friend.  It is the part of your story where you tell what happened.  This is where you explain the history of your characters and the world they live in.\n\nDr. Merlin says to avoid long passages of exposition.  It is like telling your readers everything at once.  You should show your readers what is happening.\n\nA good example is in a movie or TV show.  One character tells another a lot of information about something that happened a long time ago.  This is called information dumping.\n\nIn fiction, the author does the telling.  But the author should not tell too much.  The reader wants to learn about the characters and the story as it happens.\n\nLet's look at an example.  A story says the heroine married a man, but he was killed in front of her.  The story does not just say this.  It shows how much the heroine loved her husband.  It shows how much he loved her.  This makes the reader care about the heroine and her husband.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would make the reader sad when he dies.  The reader would understand why the heroine is sad.  This makes the story more interesting.\n\nAs a writer, you need to make your story interesting.  You need to give your readers meat, not just bones.  This is called showing, not telling.\n\nSometimes it is tempting to rush past things.  But you should not.  You should take the time to make your story good.",

            "Brothers have a special connection. It is a strong, unbreakable bond. This bond has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other in a special way. They see themselves in their brother. When things are very bad, the true nature of this bond is clear. It is either good or bad. When these feelings become strong, they can cause big problems. A part of understanding this bond is dealing with the results of these feelings. When one brother can look at the other and see himself, he sees himself as he really is. He sees himself through his actions and the results of those actions. This is where his true character is.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this connection between two brothers. The story is about two boys who go on a difficult journey. They face bitter disappointment and great pride in a big moment. Only one brother survives. The story shows how one brother feels pride. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants a brother who can run and climb trees. But his little brother, Doodle, is sick. He cannot do these things. The big brother is very sad. He even thinks about hurting his little brother. But then he sees Doodle smile. This makes him happy. This shows that he really loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about two brothers who are very different. One is strong, and the other is weak. But they are connected in a special way. This connection is shown through the actions of the big brother and the way he feels about his little brother. The story teaches us about the importance of love and family.",
            "The brain is a complex machine that helps us think and learn. As time has passed, people have used different pictures to explain how the brain works. At first, it was compared to a piece of paper, then to a written book, and now to a computer. These pictures can be helpful, but they also have limitations.\n\nThe brain takes information from our senses and changes it into electrical signals. Our senses tell us things like touch, heat, sound, and light. This information is changed into signals that the brain uses to understand the world. The brain changes this information in two ways: from simple to more complex, and from general to specific. For example, when you look at a picture of a box, the brain first sees the colors and edges of the box. Then, it uses this information to decide what you are seeing. The brain also uses what it knows about boxes to help you understand what you are seeing.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides which information is important and how much attention it needs. For example, you do not notice every single blade of grass when you look at your shoes. But you can hear your name in a loud room.\n\nThe brain stores information in different kinds of memory. There is memory for what we see, hear, and feel. There is also short-term and long-term memory. First, the brain changes information into a special form. For example, when we hear a word, the brain can change it into a picture, a sound, or a meaning. After information is stored, the brain must keep it safe. Some studies on animals show that the brain keeps information in the brain for a short time by sending electrical signals through certain brain cells.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some from computers, and some from brain science. One idea is that the brain has special groups of cells that are connected to each other. For example, if you think of a chair, your brain might connect the word \"chair\" to the word \"table,\" and then to the word \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley warns about dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. People in the story value community above the individual. They are conditioned to be happy right now. They do not think about the future or the past. The citizens are like pawns in a game. They follow one way of thinking. This way of thinking is decided by the World Controller.\n\nSome people see Huxley's work as a warning about capitalism. They think he is saying that big businesses control people and make them follow the rules. Huxley uses ideas from Marxism to show his concerns. He talks about how people are not equal. Some people are more important than others. This is like what happens in a big business.\n\nHuxley uses a word from Marxism called \"false consciousness\" to explain how people do not know the truth about their place in society. They are too busy thinking about their own needs. They do not think about the needs of others. They are controlled by the World Controller. The lower classes do not know they are being controlled. They just think they are happy and free. The upper classes know, but they do not do anything to change things. Most people just accept their place in society.\n\nIn the story, people do not have deep relationships with each other. They do not show strong emotions. They just talk about what they see on the surface. For example, they talk about how people look. This shows that Huxley is worried that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom and their chance to be themselves.\n\nThe people in the story do not question their place in society. They just follow the rules. This shows that Huxley is saying that capitalism is controlling people's lives. They do not have the power to make their own choices.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Many students, including me, know that getting around campus can be hard. My first year, I lived in East Halls, which is far from the rest of the campus. Going to classes in buildings like the Willard building, which is near the center of campus, took 25 minutes on foot. It took longer if the weather was bad, which it often was in State College. I talked to a graduate who is not much older than I am. He said that not long ago, the East Halls were far from the rest of the school. There was empty space between them. Now, this space has buildings, sports fields and apartments. As the campus gets bigger, it is harder to get from one place to another. One good way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But we need to ride bicycles and the campus needs to be friendly for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after not doing so for several years. He said, \"Bicycles are good. For a few years, it was not cool to ride a bike, but it is the best way to get around.\" Cycling is also good for your body. It is the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride a bike 30 miles or more. I now live off campus, far from the center of the campus. The smart decision I made this year was to buy a bike. I ride my bike to Thomas building for class. It takes 5 minutes if I ride fast. The problem is that Pollock Road is not always easy to ride on. There are better ways to walk, but I do not have time. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk to Thomas building. Walking would take 30-40 minutes. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Insomnia Study: Biological and Sociocultural Models\n\nThis paper looks at the two main models of insomnia: the biological and sociocultural models. The biological model focuses on genetic information and medical aspects of health. The sociocultural model looks at environmental relationships and how they affect race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that can be primary, related to another mental disorder, or caused by other issues. There are different types of insomnia. The primary sleep disorders are called Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with sleeping or staying asleep. Parasomnias are sleep disorders that involve behavioral or physical problems.\n\nThe biological model of insomnia looks at things like genes and the brain. A study found that a group of nerve cells in the brain called orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. This study was done on mice. The study found that a type of protein in these nerve cells helps control sleep. If this protein is not working correctly, it can cause problems with sleep. This study implies that genes can affect sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model of insomnia looks at how environment can affect sleep. For example, people from different racial and ethnic groups may have different sleep patterns. People from different economic backgrounds may also have different sleep patterns. A person's sleep can be affected by their genetics, their environment, and their lifestyle.\n\nA study found that a type of medicine called baclofen can help people sleep. This medicine works by acting on a type of protein in the brain. This study suggests that the biological model of insomnia is correct. If a person has a genetic problem that affects their sleep, they may need medicine to help them sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model of insomnia also suggests that environment can affect sleep. For example, people who are poor may have trouble sleeping because they are worried about money. People who are from a different culture may have different sleep patterns. A person's sleep can be affected by many things, including their environment and their lifestyle.\n\nIn conclusion, the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia are two different ways of looking at the same problem. The biological model looks at genes and the brain. The sociocultural model looks at environment and lifestyle. Both models are important for understanding insomnia.",
            "What is Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD)?\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. It is not a hearing problem. When we have a hearing problem, we cannot hear sounds. But people with CAPD can hear sounds. The problem is with the brain. The brain does not work correctly to understand what we hear.\n\nThe brain is the control center of the body. It helps us understand what we see and hear. For people with CAPD, the brain does not work well to separate words and other sounds. They have trouble hearing in noisy places.\n\nWhat is the history of CAPD?\n\nCAPD was first mentioned in the 1950s. Doctors were trying to understand children with communication problems. They were looking for ways to test these children. In 1954, some doctors started testing children with CAPD. In 1961, they found a way to test how the brain works when we hear two things at the same time.\n\nHow does CAPD affect people?\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble with many things. They may not know where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. They may not understand sounds that are in a pattern. They may not know what someone means by a change in voice. They may block one sound with another sound. They may not understand sounds in the right order.\n\nHow is CAPD diagnosed?\n\nWe diagnose CAPD by looking at how a person listens and acts when they hear things. We use many tests to see if a person has CAPD. These tests are not always the same, and we do not know the cause of CAPD.\n\nWhat can a teacher do to help a student with CAPD?\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in many ways. They can provide a quiet place for the student to work. They can help the student to listen carefully. They can show the student how to repeat words and sounds. They can help the student to understand what they hear. They can be patient and understanding. They can help the student to learn and succeed.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be useful for deceiving people. But, in the end, it can be hard to stop using a disguise. If you keep using one, you may lose yourself. The problem is that stopping a deception can cause trouble. You may feel alone and separated from people you care about. Some people may not be upset when they find out they were tricked. Others will be angry and hurt.\n\nThe play makes us think about why people use disguises, especially when they pretend to be the opposite sex. In Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself from harm. She is good at acting like a man, but it makes her feel alone and separate from the women around her. She also has feelings for two people, Orsino and Olivia. Orsino is the man who loves Viola, but Viola is afraid to tell him the truth. Olivia falls in love with Viola, who is pretending to be a man.\n\nThe play shows how using a disguise can make people see their true feelings. Olivia and Orsino may have feelings for each other, but they do not show them because of Viola's disguise. This makes us wonder if people's feelings are truly what they seem. Is Olivia in love with Viola because she is a man, or does she really have feelings for women? The play does not give us a clear answer.\n\nThe play suggests that people may be attracted to people who look a certain way, not just because of who they are. This is shown when Olivia easily falls in love with Sebastian, who looks like Viola. This makes us think about how people judge others based on how they look.",
            "The German government ruled many lands outside of Germany. This government was known for its unfair and cruel treatment of people. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama in South West Africa. However, the German government was not always unfair. It supported education in some of its colonies. \n\nIn East Africa, the British found many Africans who could read and write when they took control of the area in 1919. German schools in Kamerun and other colonies were also good. \n\nBut South West Africa was different. The government in this area did not do much to help Africans get an education. Instead, it relied on missionary groups to teach the local people. The government built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools. But the Africans in South West Africa did not have the same opportunities. Most of them could not read or write.\n\nThe German government spent a lot of money on schools for Europeans in South West Africa. This had a big effect on the area even after the Germans left. Other German colonies had many educated Africans, but South West Africa was different. Many Africans in this area did not have an education.\n\nWe need to study why this happened. This paper will look at the reasons and the attitudes of the people who lived in South West Africa.\n\nThere is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of the information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of these sources compare education in different colonies. They show that each colony had its own system of education. One study compares South West Africa and East Africa. The writer of this study says that the number of white people in South West Africa was the reason for its different education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate and many white people lived there by 1913. But the African population did not have the same opportunities. The number of white people in South West Africa was higher than in other German colonies.",
            "Heavy Metal Music: A Growing Genre\n\nHeavy metal music has changed a lot over the last 100 years. Many kinds of metal music exist today, making it hard to list them all. Also, most metal music styles have smaller groups, or sub-genres, within them. Heavy metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive metal music styles. It shows a wide range of feelings, usually on the darker side.\n\nThis music style started to grow and change about 40 years ago. People began to see that heavy metal had a lot of possibilities and started to create their own sub-genres. This led to even smaller groups, or sub-sub-genres, and it continues to grow today.\n\nNow, we have many different kinds of heavy metal groups. It is hard to say what heavy metal really is. But to understand the heavy metal music that is popular today, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy metal is known for its strong and dark sound. It often has a lot of power, a lot of loud music and a lot of energy. People who play heavy metal music are usually very good at their instruments. This is clear in the music. Heavy metal is also a movement that is connected to drug use. In the 1970s, many people used psychedelic drugs, which made them create crazy and different music. This music had a lot of dark and powerful qualities that were new to the music world. Some later groups took their ideas from the dark and powerful qualities of the Romantic Era.\n\nMany songs in heavy metal express the dark side of life. These songs show that heavy metal is a music style that is connected to the darker side of life. One good example of this is the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles. This song shows the ups and downs of drug use and is considered one of the first heavy metal songs. It was made in response to a similar song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make heavy music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau and his Dream\n.\n\nBefore the famous Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was creating his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His painting, The Dream, made in 1910, shows a woman in wonder at the beauty of the land she visits in a dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted recognition, approval, and praise from other artists and art lovers. But he had a big problem: he was not sure if he should follow the styles of others or be himself.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know a little about Rousseau's life. He was born in a town in northwest France on May 21, 1844. His father was a hardware dealer. Rousseau grew up and got a job with the government when he was young. He worked there for 40 years. He got no special training in art, but he started painting when he was older. His first wife and many of their children died. He felt sad and wanted a new life. So, he started painting to feel better.\n\nUnlike other artists of his time, Rousseau was not a romantic painter. He was a folk painter who wanted to make art like regular people. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he was not sure how to do it. He was not educated in art and started painting late in life. Many other artists were already famous when he began to make a name for himself. It was not until around the same time that another famous artist, Matisse, was becoming well-known that Rousseau started to get recognition.\n\nThe artist Jan Gordon wrote that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was simple and easy to understand, so people would like his art. Matisse, on the other hand, did not want to paint in a way that was boring or common.",
            "Many smart people think there is a strong connection between what is good and what is beautiful. I agree with this idea. It makes sense to me. John Keats says in a poem, \"Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. That is all you know on earth, and all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life from education and experience. But we seem to understand what is good and what is beautiful without being taught. Both what is good and what is beautiful are attempts to explain why something is good or why something is beautiful. We do not make a list of rules to decide what is good or what is beautiful.\n\nIn fact, it is hard to fully explain why a painting is good art or why an action is a good action. We can talk about the colors in a painting, or the way the artist used light and shadow. But these things do not explain why a painting is good. When we talk about a favorite painting, we often say \"There's just something about it.\" This is because there is something more to good art and good actions that we cannot explain.\n\nI think that art and good actions have this same quality. Flannery O'Connor says that a story is a way to say something that cannot be said in any other way. No matter how much we describe a story, there is something more that remains. I believe that what is good also has this quality. The German philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein says that what is good cannot be expressed. It is beyond words.\n\nI think that what is good and what is beautiful are connected because they both touch us deeply. We feel them at a level that is hard to explain. This connection is even stronger when it comes to stories. What makes a story good is its moral value. It is the values that we find in a story that make it important to us. Living involves making choices and decisions based on values. Stories help us understand these values and make them important to us.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is united and has its own special culture. This culture is from many different people who came to Germany long ago. Some came from the mountains near München, while others came from the city of Kiel near the Baltic Sea.\n\nYou can feel this culture in many places in Germany. It is in the city of Köln on the Rhine River, in the center of Germany, and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River. So, it is not surprising that Germany has a mix of cultures from different people and tribes.\n\nThe land where the Germans live is called Germania. The name \"Germany\" is not clear. Some people think it came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians. Others think it came from the Gauls, who lived in a different area. They called the Germans \"Germanus\" because they were different from them.\n\nThe Romans knew the Germans well. They fought many battles with them. The Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his history book. He said they were a strong and noisy people who lived beyond the Rhine River. They fought with the Gauls, who lived near the Rhine.\n\nSome people think the name \"Germany\" came from a special spear the Germans used in battle. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This could mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book. He said they were the original people of Germany and did not come from other countries. He said they were a strong and proud people who did not want to leave their land.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany, but they traded with the Germans and fought battles with them. The Germans traded goods and skills with the Romans, and some even served in the Roman army.",
            "I looked down and saw nothing in my mind.  The view before me was just a picture.  I did not think about the picture.  I just looked at it.  Thoughts came and went quickly.  My mind was active, but I did not think deeply.  \n\nI learned to draw from a book.  The book was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I wanted to be an artist since I was six years old.  The book teaches about pencils and how the brain sees lines.  One technique is to draw a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simpler.  \n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table.  I could not imagine drawing a square around it.  I was too busy looking at it.  I was amazed.  I wanted to be an artist like Picasso, who used blue colors, or Monet, who loved green.  I wanted my picture, called \"Work in Brown,\" to be great.  \n\nI picked up my pencil.  My hand moved to the paper.  My mind was ready to create.  I started to draw.  But my hand moved to the toilet handle.  Something was stuck.  I tried to fix it.  I used a mop to clean up the mess.  It was a hard job.  Finally, I was able to get rid of the problem.  I was ready to create again.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several things contribute to this problem. One reason is that young brains are not ready for the dangers of driving. Young drivers have not had much experience. This lack of experience causes more accidents and more serious problems like driving off the road or speeding.\n\nYoung drivers do worse when they have friends in the car. Most young drivers drive with friends. A study showed that the age of the passenger and the number of accidents are connected.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for young drivers. They require special licenses that limit the hours they can drive and say they cannot drive with other young people in the car.\n\nI think these special licenses are not enough. The problem is that young drivers are not ready to handle the risks of driving. Some experts think it is too early to give a regular license to anyone under 19 or 20 years old. This age group likes to take risks for the fun of it. It makes sense to wait until this desire to take risks goes away. If we continue to give licenses to young teens, many more accidents will happen. The number of young drivers will grow in a few years, and the number of accidents will also grow.\n\nA simple solution is to make a law that no one under 18 can drive. Schools can teach people how to drive, but no one under 18 can get a license. A special permit can still be given before a full license, and a certain number of practice hours are still required. This is the same as most states. This law will save many lives and prevent many accidents.\n\nThis idea is not new. Many people think it is a good idea.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. I watched all trick films made by Thomas Edison from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of these films. Trick films use editing to create illusions. I studied these films to understand their storytelling and camera work. Most trick films from this time are set in a single place. The camera does not move, and the shots are long and medium length. The films follow a rule: one shot equals one film. However, some films from the early 1900s break this rule.\n\nOne thing that all trick films have in common is that they were filmed in a single set. The camera did not move to follow people or objects. This style comes from theater and vaudeville shows. The camera was fixed in one place. People in the films only moved side to side, not towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" actors enter from one side and move back and forth.\n\nTrick films mostly use long and some medium shots. They do not use close-up shots. This is because the theater and vaudeville tradition shows the whole performance at one time. Actors did not move towards the camera, so close-ups were not used.\n\nMost trick films are short, about a minute or less. They are like short vaudeville tricks that show magic or disappearing acts. However, some trick films use many small shots to create an illusion. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" a close look shows that the \"head\" is actually a separate shot. The filmmakers joined many small shots together to create a single illusion.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republican ideas. He was a farmer, but his work in politics made him known for his strong opinions on personal freedom and government. Taylor believed that the best system of government is based on farming. His ideas about government were influenced by his work on farms.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a chance to create the perfect system of government. This was because the country was new and had no old traditions to follow. This allowed the creators of the government to make a system of self-government. Taylor believed in the rights of all people. He thought these rights are connected and important for everyone. If one right is taken away, it weakens all the other rights. He said the government should not be able to take away these rights.\n\nTaylor believed that in a natural state, people with power and evil intentions do well. But in a society, this should not be true. He thought a good government must understand the good and bad in people. Taylor believed that government is like people. It has virtues and vices. He said good principles are those that protect private property, help farming, and reduce capitalism. He thought a government based on good principles would work fairly, even if its leaders are selfish.\n\nTaylor wanted a limited government with few powers. He thought the federal government should only have the powers listed in the Constitution. He knew a strong federal government is expensive and may be cruel. But he also thought a simple, strict interpretation of the Constitution could be bad. He believed we need to understand the writers' intentions when they made the Constitution. Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States. It explains that the country is a group of states, not just one nation.",
            "We look at Figure 17, and see a big drop in people sending in their commuter log information in the third month of the project. This is not good news, and it's hard to understand why it happened. Winter arrived at our New England school, and this time of year fewer people walk or ride their bicycles to campus. This might be part of the reason for the drop in submissions. December is also the end of the fall school term. Students and teachers are busy finishing their work and getting ready for winter break. They might not have time to fill out the commuter log. The winter break is a month long, and many people do not have to come to school. When classes start again in late January, we see a decrease in the number of logs submitted again. This is not a good sign. We created a special week in March called Carpool Challenge Week to try and get people more interested in the project again. This effort was successful, and more people sent in their logs that month. So, we face challenges in keeping people engaged in the project. There are natural reasons for this, such as the holidays and school breaks. We also have a big problem: people like to drive their cars. This is a part of our culture. To get people to try other ways of getting to school, we need incentives. We offered prizes like gift certificates to local stores and restaurants. We wanted to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bike or a new car. This might have kept people more interested in the project.",
            "An ETF is a special kind of investment. It is like a fund that follows a group of stocks, a product, or a mix of investments. But it is more flexible and trades like a single stock on a market.\n\nAn ETF gives you the advantage of a group of stocks and the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy with borrowed money, and buy as few shares as one. These benefits are very attractive. But ETFs have some costs, like paying a fee for every trade, just like buying a stock. There are also many kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nTo understand ETFs, we will look at the ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to know if owning one ETF is like owning a group of ten stocks. We also want to know if there is a better way to choose these same stocks.\n\nWe cannot look at all the stocks in the ETF. So we will look at the top 10 stocks, which make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 stocks and the percentage of the ETF they make up.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we will use a special calculation. We will look at how these stocks would do if we had a portfolio of just these 10 stocks. We will compare this to the ETF.\n\nThe chart below shows the results. We can see that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks would make 6.11% more than the ETF. It would also have a lower risk, or Beta, of 0.12. This means that the top 10 stocks could provide a higher return with less risk.\n\nBut we need to be sure that these results are not just a coincidence. We need to see if the difference between the two portfolios is real. To do this, we will look at the standard deviation of each stock. We will compare this to the standard deviation of the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem, Dream-Land, is one of his important works. Poe uses a word called \"Thulé\" twice at the beginning and end of the poem. This word is from a place in ancient stories. The ancient Greeks thought it was the edge of the world.\n\nPoe was interested in the writings of a German author named Goethe. Some people think Poe took ideas from Goethe's writing. A writer named Karl J. Arndt wrote about the similarity between Poe's poem \"Politian\" and Goethe's poem \"Mignon.\"\n\nGoethe is famous for writing a play called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts. The first part came out in 1808, and the second part was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It is about a king whose wife dies. He then drinks heavily and cries because he misses his wife. He decides it is time for him to die and gives his things to his children. He then goes to a cliff, throws a special cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The king in this poem is like the man in Poe's Dream-Land. They both drink too much and are very sad.\n\nGoethe's poem \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's Dream-Land can be read together. In Dream-Land, the speaker says he is in a dark and lonely place. He sees a world without color and is haunted by dead friends. These ideas are also in \"The King of Thulé.\" The king in \"The King of Thulé\" just lost his wife and is also lonely and sad.\n\nGoethe was a well-known writer, and Poe would have known his work. Poe liked another writer named Tennyson. Poe said he admired Tennyson. Poe would have also known Goethe's work because many of his writings were copied and printed after the original publication.",
            "In California, a customer who gets hurt after slipping and falling on spilled applesauce in a grocery store can ask for extra money damages from the store. This is because the store manager knew about the spill twice and did not clean it for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner at the time.\n\nThe customer, Jennifer Palmer, has a good chance of winning her claim for extra damages. To win this claim, she must show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with mean and selfish behavior. He must have known that not cleaning the spill would hurt someone. The court will probably not throw out her claim right away.\n\nPalmer can say that Martin should have known the spill would hurt someone because many other customers had slipped and fallen in the store in the past. Even after that, Martin still did not clean the spill. Palmer's argument that Martin's behavior was mean is not very strong, but it is still a good point. Many customers had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009, and Martin did not take action to keep the store safe.\n\nOn one day in October 2009, an employee of the store, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill. Martin said he was on break and did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Another employee, Mary Haddigan, also told Martin about the spill, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt badly.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra damages if the other person acted with bad behavior. The law says this happens when the person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice is when the person intended to hurt someone, or when they did something very bad and knew it would hurt someone, but they did it anyway.\n\nIn this case, the judge will decide if Martin acted with malice. If he did, Palmer can get extra damages.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One big question we talked about was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is still very important today.  Since 9/11, I have seen how the media has changed its view of Islam.  It used to be mostly negative.  Now it is very tolerant.  In 2001, I do not think Americans would have voted for a president with a name like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam.\n\nI read the biography of Muhammad. It is interesting.  I learned that Muhammad was not a strong leader who forced people to be Muslim.  Instead, he was a kind person who showed people the truth through his words and actions.  People came to him because they believed in him.  This is different from what I thought I knew about Muhammad.\n\nI also see some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the life of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food and drink for many people.  The writer of the biography wants Muhammad to be seen as a humble and kind person.  But this can take away from the greatness of Jesus.  It is like taking credit for someone else's work.  I think this is not right.\n\nI do not like it when the biography tells stories that are not true.  Sometimes the stories are secondhand.  The writer heard from someone else who heard from someone else.  This makes the stories seem less believable.\n\nI have a problem with how the biography presents Muhammad.  The writer says he was a kind and wise person.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's life.",
            "Jesus' teachings and ideas are no longer the main part of Christian thought today.  This happened after his death.  If we look at Christian history, we see a trend.  It is a trend of Christianity moving away from its start.  Many people today are becoming more aware of this.  They want to go back to the ideas Jesus taught.  They want to know what he really said.  This movement will grow.  It will become bigger and stronger.  People want to know what Jesus' ideas were.  They want to know the real meaning of Christianity.  It may take a long time, but it will happen.  The Christian church will go back to its original form.  People will forget about the ideas added to the religion.  They will learn what Jesus said about God.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will think and believe the same way.  The Christian church will still be strong.  But people will be more alike in their thinking.  There will be less difference between different groups of Christians.  This has happened before in history.  The Roman Empire used to be against Christians.  But later, it became Christian.  Our country used to treat African-Americans badly.  But now they have leaders.  This change is coming to the Christian church.  It will be a big change.  To understand what Jesus said, people will have to think about his words as symbols, not as facts.\n\nLooking far back in history, we see only one main idea:  the Jewish religion.

The leaders of big companies are a good example. They want to make a lot of money and make their companies bigger. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way.\n\nThe book describes the big factories. They are black and have big chimneys that send out bad smoke. The smoke hurts people and animals. The leaders do not care about this. They also do not care about the animals in the pens. The pens are dirty and have animal waste. \n\nThe leaders also do not care about their workers. They work long hours and do not get paid much. The leaders can fire them at any time without giving them help finding a new job. The workers live in bad conditions and are very poor. They are treated like slaves. The book says they are as helpless as slaves were in the past.\n\nThe system in the book is not fair. The workers have no protection. They cannot get help or information. Some groups, called unions, are supposed to help the workers, but they often make money from the poor workers. This makes the workers' lives worse.\n\nThe book shows that many people in this situation are not able to take care of themselves. They are very poor and have no chance to escape.",

Scott Fitzgerald uses these special ways in his book The Great Gatsby. \nSome of his techniques are very effective. He often puts two words together that do not usually go together to give readers a certain feeling about a subject. \nFitzgerald does this with many colors, including gold, green, white, and gray. He builds up meaning for these colors and then uses them to make readers feel a certain way.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show that something is not special or important. \nAt first, the book describes many people wearing white and gray. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt. Daisy and Jordan are often dressed in white. Fitzgerald also uses these colors to describe ordinary things. The streets of New York are like white chasms. The cars and land in a valley are gray.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors to show that something is not special. He uses them to make readers feel that something is common or usual. This happens with Daisy. Fitzgerald describes her as dressed in white and gray. Readers start to see her as not a special person, but just a part of Gatsby's life.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors many times in the book to show that some people and things are not special.

They can also watch birds and other animals.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps animals and plants in the area. But it can be harder and more expensive than farming with chemicals. Farmers must work harder to remove pests and weeds. They must also use special methods to make the soil healthy without chemicals. \n\nThe area near the town of Potrero in California is good for farming. It has chaparral, grassland, and oak trees. It is next to the Cleveland National Forest. Many plants and animals live there. Some are in danger and need protection.

            "Culture plays a very important role in any negotiation. Culture is not the same for everyone. It is not one thing or one idea. It can be different in many ways. We should not say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating.\" These statements are too broad and not very accurate.\n\nTo be a good negotiator, we need to understand what culture means in a specific situation. We need to know how a culture can help or hurt the negotiation. When we meet a new culture, we should think about how it is like or different from our own culture. We should try to learn about the culture's history and what it values.\n\nInstead of judging a culture, we should accept it for what it is. We should respect its traditions and beliefs. This can help us get past any problems and move the negotiation forward. If we are in a weaker position, showing respect can be especially helpful.\n\nCulture is not just about countries or nations. A company can have its own culture. For example, some companies value hard work, while others value work-life balance. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they make decisions. Even within the same country, different companies can have very different cultures.\n\nValues are very important to understand. They tell us why people in a culture behave in certain ways. If saving face is important, people will not want to lose face in a negotiation. If a culture values hard work, people will not want to give up easily. Before a negotiation, we should think about these things. We should also try to learn about our opponent's values and personality to be successful.",
            "A famous Bible verse says: \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. It is also in the beginning of an argument by St. Anselm about God's existence. Thomas Aquinas believes the same thing. Their arguments are about the same idea, so we will compare them. We will start by assuming they are both right about God.\n\nThis God is the one in the Bible. If we talk about a different kind of god, we can't compare their arguments. They are trying to prove the same kind of God. So, we will look at their ideas. \n\nSt. Anselm's idea is that we can know God just by thinking. He says if we know something, we can't think about it not existing. This is a bit hard to understand, but the main idea is that God's existence is in our minds. We don't need outside evidence to know God. This is like faith in the Bible. It's not about proof, but about believing something because it feels true.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can know God by using reason and looking at the world. He doesn't need faith. He says we can use five different ideas to prove God's existence. These are change, cause, need, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He says we can know God is real just by thinking about these things.",

You can see this in the country of Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, people celebrate a special water-cutting ceremony every year. Many people, both monks and laypeople, take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about this celebration.\n\nBuddhism has changed in many ways. This is true for both monks and laypeople. The ideas of Buddhism have been different over time. This is because of forces both inside and outside the Buddhist community. These forces are either friendly or not friendly to Buddhism.\n\nThere are some important words to know for this discussion. An internal force is a force from inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a force from people who are not Buddhist. A hostile force hurts the Buddhist community. A friendly force does not hurt or help the Buddhist community. These words will be used often in this discussion.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the basics of Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma includes the Tripitaka, three groups of Buddhist texts. These texts tell us about the Buddha's teachings. The Tripitaka has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has many teachings from the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka tells us rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka explains the meaning of life and death. It tells us that everything is not permanent and that we have no soul. This is important to understanding Buddhism.\n\nBuddhists also follow the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome. These truths are very important in Buddhism.",
            "Many years ago, the United States and Mexico were enemies. They fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and took some land from Mexico. This event made the two countries have a long-lasting problem.\n\nThey had many small fights over the years. The problem started because of different ideas about religion, culture, and tradition. The two countries also had different interests.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have disagreements. The United States and Mexico are not alone. Many other countries have problems with their neighbors.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher said that the United States has had big problems with only two countries: Mexico and Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States.\n\nThe two countries had a big disagreement about religion. The United States did not like the Mexican Catholic church. This caused a problem between the two countries for a long time.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not get along because of the English and Spanish. These countries had a long time ago. The US and Mexico liked or disliked the same things because of this.\n\nThe US and Mexico had 17 big disagreements between 1836 and 1893. Most of these disagreements were about land. Some people from Mexico would cross the border and take things from the US. The US and Mexico had to use force to stop these problems.\n\nEventually, the US and Mexico became friends. Mexico needed the US for help, and the US stopped trying to take its land. This made the two countries stop being enemies.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got sick and could not move. This was a surprise. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job because it seemed safe. People will always be sick, and I could always find work.\n\nI wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing because it was safe. I was 46 years old and had no money. I could not work. Today, I still have a problem moving. I get money from the government because I am sick. But I have no money for myself.\n\nI have to work hard every day. I am not safe and I am not happy. I do not know what will happen tomorrow. But I know that my family and friends helped me. They helped me when I was weak.\n\nMy point is that bad things happen in life. We cannot control everything. We need to help each other. We need to ask for help. We should not just depend on the government.\n\nSome people in the US think we should not depend on the government. But I think we should help each other. We should be kind to each other. Our ancestors were not alone. They helped each other. They shared food and supplies. They worked together.\n\nWe should be prepared for bad things. I have a box with food and water. I have a first aid kit and a way to make water clean. I have a light and candles. But we also need to know our neighbors. We need to be kind to each other.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time in the way they do. Are there rules that control how they change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that even now, biologists do not know how to use math to describe the simplest living things. Even today, this is still true.\n\nRecently, people have used math to understand how some animals build their skeletons. They studied how animals develop their skeletons over time (ontogeny) and how their skeletons change over many generations (phylogeny). Our study is exploring how math can help us understand how animals change their skeletons.\n\nWe used special pictures of a type of shellfish to understand how its skeleton changes. We looked at the pictures and found numbers that can be used to model how the shellfish skeleton changes. We entered these numbers into a computer program to create new shell shapes. These new shapes can help us understand the limits of how the shellfish skeleton can change.\n\nWe can think of a shell as a tube that grows over time. The shell grows in a spiral shape, like a snake. Each part of the spiral is called a whorl. The whorls grow around a center point. The center point is called the columella. The shell grows in different ways, and a line separates each whorl. This line is called a suture.\n\nThe largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The rest of the whorls are called the spire. The top of the spire is called the apex, and the bottom is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can see shells in four different ways: from the top, bottom, front, and back. The usual way to see a shell is from the front, with the opening facing us and the top pointing up.\n\nWe can count the whorls by looking at the shell from the top and finding the first line. Then, we draw a line and count the whorls from that line. We can estimate the number of whorls to a quarter.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it builds its shell. We can find the path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the opening. We can draw a picture of the path and use math to understand how the shell grows.\n\nOnce we understand how the shell grows, we can change the numbers and see how the shell would change. This can help us understand how animals change over time.",
            "Indonesia's baby and young child death rates have not changed much in ten years. The country is making progress in some areas, like water and sanitation. However, the country is not doing well in meeting the goals for better health and care for mothers and children. The reasons for this are many and will be explained below. These reasons show that Indonesia's health system needs to be improved, not just individual programs.\n\nMore mothers are getting help from a trained health worker when they give birth. Seventy-two percent of births now have this help. However, this number includes traditional workers like midwives who may not have the training to help in emergencies. This means that many mothers are still at risk. In addition, fewer children with diarrhea are getting treated by a health professional. We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being cared for after giving birth. The numbers are not good across the country.\n\nNot enough mothers are having C-sections, which are operations to help with difficult births. The number of C-sections is only four percent. This number is low. It also shows another problem. In cities, seven percent of mothers have C-sections. But in rural areas, the number is only two percent. This shows that city areas have more access to good healthcare. Another problem is that poor people have less access to healthcare. There is a big difference in how many people use healthcare services between the poorest and richest families. This is because poor families have to pay for healthcare out of their own money.\n\nTo fix the problems with baby and mother care, we need to ask how to make healthcare services more available. Should Indonesia develop special programs or improve the overall healthcare system? There is no question that special programs can be helpful. They have clear goals and can make progress faster. However, there are some problems with this approach. One problem is that spending a lot of money on one area can mean that other areas get less money. This can make it hard for healthcare workers to choose where to work. Another problem is that many programs can be uncoordinated and lead to extra paperwork and waste.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed stories about the rich people of the time.  Two books that are considered Victorian but are different from this kind are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting.  This makes the characters more believable and shows what they are thinking and feeling.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to Oliver.  He sees and hears things that are not real.  This shows what is happening inside Oliver's mind.  He is worried and scared.  When Oliver is shot, he remembers it later like it was a dream.  He is very sick and can't control what is happening to him.\n\nOliver feels he has no control over his life.  He can't even try to save himself when he is in danger.  This shows that Oliver is losing hope.  He is starting to give up.  He feels defeated.  He is trapped in a world where he is not in control.\n\nWuthering Heights is another book that uses mystery and strange events.  The day and night are like a dream.  They are very long and very short.  This shows how confusing and scary the world can be.\n\nThese two books are different from other Victorian novels.  They use strange and mysterious events to make the characters more believable and interesting.  They show what is happening inside the characters' minds and how they are feeling.",
            "I worked with students after school two years ago. I helped them with their school work, but I was good at helping with English and reading. A teacher asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I thought something was strange. Some letters he could read easily, but others he could not read at all. Adrian spoke very good English, but he was from a Latino family. I was helping to take care of the other students when Adrian's mother came to the after-school program. She did not speak English. We used a little Spanish to communicate. I then understood that Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. I do not know if this helped him, but I hope he is doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to talk about the problem of language barriers in schools, especially in California. I also tell it to show that the problem is not always clear. Even a student who speaks good English can still have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was to teach him the English alphabet and how to pronounce words. For students who do not speak much English, the answer is more complex. There is no one answer. We need to use many methods: dual language programs, mainstream education, private tutors, and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.\n\nI think dual language programs are a good idea. They are not just for students who speak Spanish, but for all students. Studies show that students in these programs do better in school. Many people are afraid that this will waste money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use these programs more often, all students will benefit. So, how can we do this? Do we need to make all teachers bilingual? No, that is not possible. However, we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "When we are young, people often tell us about something bigger than us. Some go to Sunday school to learn about it, while others visit the temple or search inside themselves for answers. Many accept the religions given to them by their parents. But some reject them completely. They do not believe there is something beyond what they know in their own world. They may choose one value system, then change it for another. We all try to understand a part of ourselves in our own way.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our front porch. He said his favorite bird was the cardinal. We listened to the rain on the tin roof. The rain came from the gutters and drowned the plants near the porch. My father looked out into the rain. He seemed to be thinking and remembering. He was thinner and looked weak. His hair was thin and sparse. He did not look at me. I felt sad and afraid. I could not talk to him about how much I would miss him. If I did, it would make it more real. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out into the rain together.\n\nMy father died five days after my twenty-second birthday in December. He had cancer. The treatment did not ease his pain, but it kept him alive a little longer than the doctors said. What was the point, I thought? If God existed, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to watch my father die. I did not want to see the man who created me go away. I wanted to remember my father when he was alive, not when he was sick. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days, waiting for the news. But no one called me.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel\" is a strange mix of old and new ideas. This is how Ian Watt describes it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel\". The Gothic style has been praised and blamed. Some people say it has no real meaning. Others say it is great because it creates a sense of fear and excitement. The first \"Gothic Novel\" was written by Horace Walpole. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto\". Walpole used ideas from old stories and new ways of writing to create a new style. He used old theater and modern ideas to write a story that was new.\n\nThe Gothic style uses many old ideas from medieval times. These ideas came from theater, architecture, and traditions. When \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things. It was seen as old-fashioned in a world that valued progress and new ideas.\n\nThe combination of the old and the new is what makes the Gothic style stay interesting for a long time. It is like a new and old thing at the same time.\n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic stories is the idea of chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a knight to be brave and honorable. This idea is important in Gothic stories because it represents a time when people believed in chivalry. The writer, Horace Walpole, was unhappy with the world he lived in. He wanted to show that the good qualities of the past were missing in the present. He used the idea of chivalry to make the past seem better than the present.\n\nIn the story, there is a character named Frederic. He is a prince who has suffered in the past. He is described as a brave and chivalrous knight. He is a good example of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" that people used to idealize. The writer is exaggerating this image to show that the qualities of the past are not present in the present.",
            "Supply Chain Management\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer's order to the raw materials and then to the customer. This process includes production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Supply chain management is used by managers of businesses to give good service to customers.\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These six parts help businesses give the best service to customers.\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base of the whole supply chain. Managers must know what customers want. To know what customers want, managers look at the market. The market shows what customers need. Once managers understand customer needs, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory will make the most and best products. Managers think about customer needs and satisfaction when making these decisions.\nAfter deciding where to make the products, managers focus on work schedules and equipment maintenance. Production is a very important step in the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned carefully, the company will waste time and money.\n\nExample: I used to work at Walmart and Target. Both companies have a plan for every part of the business. They have a plan for how employees should dress and how to receive shipments from trucks. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly without confusion.\n\nSupply is the second key part of the supply chain. Supply means making decisions about what skills a factory should have and which companies to partner with. A company may have many different factories for one product. Each factory has different equipment, workers, and skills. Managers decide which factory is best for each part of the product. They may also decide to work with other companies. This is called outsourcing. Outsourcing helps companies make good products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "A message in Burma says Hitler is alive. \nEllen Page, an actress from America, holds a sign that says this on a street corner. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a strong group of military leaders. They took control of the country in nineteen sixty-two. In two thousand seven, many people in Burma protested on the streets. These protests were called the Saffron Revolution. They were led by Buddhist monks who wear orange robes. Many people in Burma began to support the protests. But the government started to use violence against the monks. They attacked monasteries and arrested journalists who came to report on the protests. One journalist was killed in September of that year.\n\nBad things have happened in Burma before. The government there has always tried to control its people. In the past, some leaders thought they were chosen by gods to rule. In another country, Japan, leaders were believed to be gods who came to help their people. In the United States, a president had meetings with a leader of a group that does not like freedom. \n\nThere have been big protests in many countries. In China, many people protested in nineteen eighty-nine. They did not want the government to rule them. Many people died in this protest. In Rwanda, a group of people killed others because of their color or their ideas. In Germany, a long time ago, a man named Hitler killed many people who were Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington's work in jazz is very important because he lived a long time and could keep creating music. His piano playing is not always easy to hear in many of the songs he composed, but as a composer, he was great at writing songs that let the band members show off their talents. Ellington created a framework for musicians to improvise. He also wrote tightly organized pieces that used the special style of each musician to bring out their musical ideas. This way, he created new and original sounds to fit each song. Ellington knew how to get the best sound from each musician and how to put them together to make a great band. This helped him write some of the most innovative and excellent jazz music in history.\n\nA music dictionary, The Grove Music dictionary, talks about Ellington's style and his new ideas. It mentions a song called Creole Love Call. This song is an early example of Ellington using the human voice as a musical instrument. He did this throughout his career. The song is a slow, 12-bar blues. It has six parts: \n\nPart 1: The singer and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The singer starts with a smooth sound, then gets rougher at the end.\n\nPart 2: A muted trumpet player plays a solo that makes the basic melody sound better. He emphasizes some long notes.\n\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays very high notes. The piano player adds a special rhythm to the music.\n\nPart 4: The whole band repeats part 1. The brass and woodwind sections talk to each other.\n\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start talking to each other. The brass and rhythm sections play a special rhythm.\n\nPart 6: This part is like part 1. The singer starts to sound like a musical instrument. The singer uses a special technique called \"growl\" to sound like an instrument.\n\nThe song ends with a short part that includes a vocal run and a strange sound from a trombone.\n\nEllington was very good at using the human voice to add color to his music. This is just one example of his style.\n\nIn the song Hot and Bothered, Ellington combines his skill at writing tight rhythms with his ability to hear the special sound of each musician. A singer and a trumpeter play a phrase together. The singer uses the vocal parts of the trumpet player's music and the trumpet player uses the vocal parts of the singer's voice to create a rich sound. In the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player to introduce the melody in a special way.",
            "She had a big feeling inside. It was a feeling that would not go away. It started when she was 14 years old. She was in the middle of growing up. And it was still there when she was 17 years old. She wanted to be with someone, not things. But she did not like any boys. Some boys liked her, but she did not feel the same way. She wondered what was wrong with her.\n\nShe thought about this a lot. She tried to think of why she felt this way. But she could not think of a good reason. So she lived her life, and kept wondering about her feelings.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were calm and kind. They did not argue with each other. But they did argue with their daughter sometimes. They wanted her to be more like them. She was a happy and fun person. She was very likable.\n\nToday was not a peaceful day.

            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" affects the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study found that women who followed the diet had lower risk of heart disease and stroke. \n\nThe Mediterranean Diet is a type of diet that includes a lot of plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes. It also includes more monounsaturated fat and fish, and less saturated fat and animal products. A little bit of alcohol is allowed.\n\nEarlier studies showed that people who followed the Mediterranean Diet had lower risk of heart disease and death. However, these studies did not look at stroke specifically.\n\nThis study looked at 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63. They were all part of a larger group of 121,700 nurses in the United States. The women answered questions about their eating habits six times over 20 years. \n\nThe researchers used this information to calculate a score that showed how well the women followed the Mediterranean Diet. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like smoking, body weight and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They compared the women who followed the diet well with those who did not, and found that the risk of heart disease and stroke was 29% lower.\n\nThis study shows that following the Mediterranean Diet can help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "The United States had a big financial problem in 2007. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market also failed. Some of America's biggest companies were in trouble. We need to understand how this happened and how to prevent it in the future. \n\nThe problem started with bad decisions by leaders. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks and companies were not prepared to handle these loans. They sold these loans to other companies. When people could not pay their loans, the banks were in trouble. They had to give up a lot of money.\n\nThis problem started in 1999. The President at that time wanted to be popular. So, he allowed banks to give more loans to people who could not pay them back. This was a big mistake. A reporter named Steven Holmes said in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure to give loans to people with low incomes.\" He also said, \"This could cause problems when the economy is bad.\" He was right. The economy got worse, and people lost their money.\n\nMore people were in trouble when banks gave out bad loans. They used new ways to lend money. These ways made it hard for people to understand what they were doing. When the housing market failed, the banks were in big trouble. They had a lot of debt. The government had to help them. Some banks went out of business, and others had to change the way they worked.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in big trouble. They had $5 trillion in debt. The government had to take control of them. We need to be careful with money and make good decisions to prevent this from happening again.",
            "Exposition.  That part of your story where you show your writing skills.  Or the place where your readers fall asleep.\n\nExposition is not your friend.  It is the part of your story where you tell what happened.  This is where you explain the history of your characters and the world they live in.\n\nDr. Merlin says to avoid long passages of exposition.  It is like telling your readers everything at once.  You should show your readers what is happening.\n\nA good example is in a movie or TV show.  One character tells another a lot of information about something that happened a long time ago.  This is called information dumping.\n\nIn fiction, the author does the telling.  But the author should not tell too much.  The reader wants to learn about the characters and the story as it happens.\n\nLet's look at an example.  A story says the heroine married a man, but he was killed in front of her.  The story does not just say this.  It shows how much the heroine loved her husband.  It shows how much he loved her.  This makes the reader care about the heroine and her husband.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would make the reader sad when he dies.  The reader would understand why the heroine is sad.  This makes the story more interesting.\n\nAs a writer, you need to make your story interesting.  You need to give your readers meat, not just bones.  This is called showing, not telling.\n\nSometimes it is tempting to rush past things.  But you should not.  You should take the time to make your story good.",

He is named Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very sick. The police did not find the people who shot him. They are looking for clues. I think this story was too short.

            "Brothers have a special connection. It is a strong, unbreakable bond. This bond has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other in a special way. They see themselves in their brother. When things are very bad, the true nature of this bond is clear. It is either good or bad. When these feelings become strong, they can cause big problems. A part of understanding this bond is dealing with the results of these feelings. When one brother can look at the other and see himself, he sees himself as he really is. He sees himself through his actions and the results of those actions. This is where his true character is.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this connection between two brothers. The story is about two boys who go on a difficult journey. They face bitter disappointment and great pride in a big moment. Only one brother survives. The story shows how one brother feels pride. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants a brother who can run and climb trees. But his little brother, Doodle, is sick. He cannot do these things. The big brother is very sad. He even thinks about hurting his little brother. But then he sees Doodle smile. This makes him happy. This shows that he really loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about two brothers who are very different. One is strong, and the other is weak. But they are connected in a special way. This connection is shown through the actions of the big brother and the way he feels about his little brother. The story teaches us about the importance of love and family.",
            "The brain is a complex machine that helps us think and learn. As time has passed, people have used different pictures to explain how the brain works. At first, it was compared to a piece of paper, then to a written book, and now to a computer. These pictures can be helpful, but they also have limitations.\n\nThe brain takes information from our senses and changes it into electrical signals. Our senses tell us things like touch, heat, sound, and light. This information is changed into signals that the brain uses to understand the world. The brain changes this information in two ways: from simple to more complex, and from general to specific. For example, when you look at a picture of a box, the brain first sees the colors and edges of the box. Then, it uses this information to decide what you are seeing. The brain also uses what it knows about boxes to help you understand what you are seeing.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides which information is important and how much attention it needs. For example, you do not notice every single blade of grass when you look at your shoes. But you can hear your name in a loud room.\n\nThe brain stores information in different kinds of memory. There is memory for what we see, hear, and feel. There is also short-term and long-term memory. First, the brain changes information into a special form. For example, when we hear a word, the brain can change it into a picture, a sound, or a meaning. After information is stored, the brain must keep it safe. Some studies on animals show that the brain keeps information in the brain for a short time by sending electrical signals through certain brain cells.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some from computers, and some from brain science. One idea is that the brain has special groups of cells that are connected to each other. For example, if you think of a chair, your brain might connect the word \"chair\" to the word \"table,\" and then to the word \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley warns about dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. People in the story value community above the individual. They are conditioned to be happy right now. They do not think about the future or the past. The citizens are like pawns in a game. They follow one way of thinking. This way of thinking is decided by the World Controller.\n\nSome people see Huxley's work as a warning about capitalism. They think he is saying that big businesses control people and make them follow the rules. Huxley uses ideas from Marxism to show his concerns. He talks about how people are not equal. Some people are more important than others. This is like what happens in a big business.\n\nHuxley uses a word from Marxism called \"false consciousness\" to explain how people do not know the truth about their place in society. They are too busy thinking about their own needs. They do not think about the needs of others. They are controlled by the World Controller. The lower classes do not know they are being controlled. They just think they are happy and free. The upper classes know, but they do not do anything to change things. Most people just accept their place in society.\n\nIn the story, people do not have deep relationships with each other. They do not show strong emotions. They just talk about what they see on the surface. For example, they talk about how people look. This shows that Huxley is worried that technology and capitalism are taking away people's freedom and their chance to be themselves.\n\nThe people in the story do not question their place in society. They just follow the rules. This shows that Huxley is saying that capitalism is controlling people's lives. They do not have the power to make their own choices.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. Many students, including me, know that getting around campus can be hard. My first year, I lived in East Halls, which is far from the rest of the campus. Going to classes in buildings like the Willard building, which is near the center of campus, took 25 minutes on foot. It took longer if the weather was bad, which it often was in State College. I talked to a graduate who is not much older than I am. He said that not long ago, the East Halls were far from the rest of the school. There was empty space between them. Now, this space has buildings, sports fields and apartments. As the campus gets bigger, it is harder to get from one place to another. One good way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But we need to ride bicycles and the campus needs to be friendly for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike again after not doing so for several years. He said, \"Bicycles are good. For a few years, it was not cool to ride a bike, but it is the best way to get around.\" Cycling is also good for your body. It is the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride a bike 30 miles or more. I now live off campus, far from the center of the campus. The smart decision I made this year was to buy a bike. I ride my bike to Thomas building for class. It takes 5 minutes if I ride fast. The problem is that Pollock Road is not always easy to ride on. There are better ways to walk, but I do not have time. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk to Thomas building. Walking would take 30-40 minutes. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have that much time."
