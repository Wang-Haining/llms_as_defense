            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models of a sleep problem called insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder. There are two main ways to look at this problem: the Biological model and the Sociocultural model. The Biological model looks at genetics and health. The Sociocultural model looks at how the environment and things like race, ethnicity, and income affect sleep.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by many things, including other mental health problems, medical conditions, or substances. There are many types of sleep problems. Some are called Dyssomnias, which are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Others are called Parasomnias, which are problems with strange behaviors during sleep.\n\nDyssomnias include insomnia, which is a problem falling asleep or staying asleep. Hypersomnia is a problem staying awake. Narcolepsy is a problem with staying awake and alert. Breathing-related sleep disorder and circadian rhythm sleep disorder are other types of Dyssomnias. The biological model says that genetics and health can cause these problems.\n\nOne study looked at mice to understand how genes affect sleep. The study found that certain receptors in the brain help control sleep and wakefulness. These receptors can be affected by genetics, which can cause sleep problems. This study shows that genetics can affect sleep, which is good to know for people with insomnia.\n\nThe Sociocultural model looks at how the environment and society affect sleep. For example, people from different cultures or with different incomes may have different sleep patterns. A study found that certain genetic receptors in the brain can be affected by genetics, which can cause sleep problems. This means that people with certain genetic traits may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThis study is important because it shows that genetics can affect sleep. If people have a genetic problem that affects sleep, it can make it hard for them to focus and do daily tasks. This can affect their lives in many ways.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). We will explain what CAPD is, how it is diagnosed, and ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nCAPD is a disorder of the brain. It means the brain has trouble understanding what we hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain does not work correctly to understand them. This is not the same as being deaf. A person with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain has trouble separating different sounds or understanding what is being said.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first discovered in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. They developed tests to help diagnose the problem. In 1954, Italian researchers started testing children. They found that the brain has trouble with certain sounds and voices.\n\nCAPD can affect people in different ways. They may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may not be able to tell the difference between two sounds at the same time. They may not understand patterns of sound or changes in voice. They may also have trouble understanding what someone is saying.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors and specialists use tests. They observe how a person listens and responds to sounds. They may use special tools to measure how the brain works. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in several ways. The teacher can use visual aids, such as pictures or videos, to help the student understand what is being said. The teacher can also use simple language and repeat instructions. They can give the student extra time to understand what is being said. The teacher can also provide a quiet space for the student to work and listen.",

She is good at pretending and people believe she is a man. But she loses her friends and has to deal with love feelings from two people - one man and one woman.\n\nThe play shows how hiding the truth can help people find their feelings. Viola's pretending helps one man find love with her, but it also makes things complicated. The man, Orsino, had feelings for Viola when she was pretending to be a man. Now he is confused. The woman, Olivia, loves Viola when she thinks she is a man, but when she finds out, she loves Viola's twin brother, Sebastian.\n\nThe play makes people think about why people hide who they are. Is Olivia really in love with women, or does she just look at people's appearance? The play says it is not easy to know what people really feel. Olivia easily changes her feelings from one person to another. She loves Viola when she thinks Viola is a man, but when she finds out she is a woman, Olivia loves Viola's twin brother.",

Germany's education efforts in other colonies, like Kamerun, were also praised by people who lived at the time. \n\nBut South West Africa (now Namibia) was a different story. The government in East Africa built schools for local people and gave them a big role in education. In South West Africa, the job of educating the local people was left to missionary groups who got little help from the government. The government did invest in education for European people in the colony. They built schools and controlled missionary schools. \n\nThe government's choices had a lasting effect on South West Africa. Many other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people remained uneducated and unable to read. Many things caused the difference between South West Africa and other colonies. This paper will look at these things and what happened in South West Africa, especially what settlers and government officials thought about the local people.\n\nThere is a lot written about education in the German empire. Much of this writing is in German and was done a long time ago. The early writing mostly described how education was done in the different colonies. Later writing in English compared education in different colonies and looked at specific parts of education in more detail. These studies showed that each colony had a different education system. One of the most important studies is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the many European settlers in South West Africa explained many of the differences in the colony's education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a warm climate, but much of the land is desert. This is why there were a lot of European settlers in South West Africa. By 1913, about 15,000 Europeans lived there. Only about 5,300 Europeans lived in the colony with the next largest number of settlers, East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a popular music style that has grown very much over the last 100 years. Many people think it is very difficult to list all the different kinds of heavy metal music. It is even harder because many of these kinds of music have smaller groups within them. One of the most interesting kinds of heavy metal music is called heavy metal rock. It has many different emotions, mostly dark and unhappy ones. It is also very different because people started to make their own kinds of heavy metal music a long time ago. This led to smaller groups of music, and this chain of smaller groups continues today.\n\nToday, heavy metal music is very hard to understand because it has many different kinds of music in it. But to understand it, we must first know what heavy metal music is and why it is a special kind of music.\n\nHeavy metal music is a kind of music that is often about the darker side of life. It is music with more sound, more volume, and more energy. People who play heavy metal music are very good at playing their instruments, and you can hear this in their music. Heavy metal music also has a connection to drugs. Many people used drugs to create some of the first heavy metal music in the 1970s. This music had many strange and unusual qualities that were new to the music world. Later, other kinds of heavy metal music took some of these qualities from other kinds of music, like the Romantic Era. Some examples of heavy metal music show how dark and unhappy it can be:\n\nThese words from the song Helter Skelter show the darker side of music. They talk about the ups and downs of life, and some people think this song was one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a song by the Rolling Stones that was also very heavy and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music just as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau: A Dream of Acceptance\n\nHenri Rousseau painted a very special picture called \"The Dream\" in 1910. This painting shows a woman looking at wonderful things in a dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted other artists and people who love art to accept and praise him. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he also wanted to be himself and paint in his own way.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know a little about his life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a hardware seller. Rousseau did not go to school to learn about art. Instead, he worked for many years for the government. He became a toll collector and was known as a customs officer.\n\nRousseau's life was very sad. His wife and many of their children died. He was left with only one child, a daughter named Julia. He started painting to help him feel better and to start a new life. Rousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful and romantic pictures of peasants. He was a folk painter who painted about the things people in his class thought about.\n\nRousseau wanted the art world to accept him. He started painting late in life and was working at the same time as many other famous artists. It was hard for him to get recognition. It was not until around the same time that another artist, Matisse, became famous that Rousseau started to get the recognition he wanted. A writer named Jan Gordon said that Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to be a good painter and not paint in a boring way. Rousseau just wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as an artist.",
            "Many great thinkers believe that ethics and aesthetics are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same. I agree with this idea. As the great poet John Keats once said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn about many things in life through education or experience. But we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics in a different way. We try to explain what is good or beautiful, not make rules for art or behavior.\n\nWhen we talk about art or morals, we can't fully describe what makes something good or beautiful. For example, we can talk about the colors, shapes, and context of a painting like the Mona Lisa. But these things don't explain why it's a great work of art. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's something about it\" that they can't explain.\n\nI believe that both art and morals have a special quality that can't be fully described. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way. . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" We can describe art and morals, but there's always something more.\n\nI think that this is why ethics and aesthetics are connected. We experience both of them in a deep way that can't be fully explained. This is especially true for literature. Literature has a special ability to teach us about values and morals. As the writer McKean said, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. It's as important to our lives as our values themselves.\"",
            "Germany is a strong country with its own culture. This culture comes from many different groups of people. You can feel it in the great cities of Germany, from München near the Alps to the city of Kiel near the Baltic Sea.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many different tribes lived in this area. They came from many places. The name 'Germany' comes from these tribes. But its meaning is not clear.\n\nThe Roman writer Tacitus said the name came from a group of people called the Tungrians. They were also called Germans before they crossed the Rhine River and fought the Gauls. The Roman leader Julius Caesar used the word 'Germanus' in his writings about the wars he fought against the Gauls. Caesar got the word from the Gauls themselves. He used it to talk about the people he had not yet defeated.\n\nSome people think the name 'Germany' comes from a spear used by the Germans in war. Others think it comes from the Old Irish word 'garim', which means 'to shout'. This may mean the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman writer Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum'. He said the Germans were the first people to live in the area. They did not come from other places. They were not mixed with other groups of people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They sent soldiers to the area to get goods and to fight. But they mostly stayed in their own country. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and skills with the Romans.",
            "I looked down at the picture before me.  My mind was empty.  I was not feeling any strong feelings.  I was simply looking at the view.  My brain was working quickly.  It was taking in the picture and then moving on.  I did not have strong thoughts about what I was seeing.  I was just observing.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  An artist told me to buy it.  It teaches people how to draw.  One thing it says is to draw a square around a picture.  This makes it easier to understand.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit.  But I could not imagine a square around it.  I was too busy looking at all the details.  I was amazed.\n\nMany famous artists, like Picasso and Monet, have their own ways of seeing the world.  I wanted to be an artist too.  I wanted to create something special.  I wanted to make a good picture.\n\nMy hand reached for a pencil.  I was ready to start drawing.  But then I thought about something else.  My hand went to the toilet handle.  I had to move something that was stuck.\n\nI grabbed a mop and a piece of toilet paper.  I put the mop on the floor and stood up straight.  Then I bent down and put my hand into the toilet.  It was not easy.  But I did it.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many things cause this problem. One reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teens also do not have much experience driving. This lack of experience causes more accidents and increases the number of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nWhen teens drive with their friends, the risk of an accident is even higher. A study in Southern California found a connection between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states are trying to make driving safer for teens. They require special temporary licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and do not allow other minors as passengers. But these special licenses are just temporary solutions. The real problem is that teens, as a group, are not able to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.\n\nA psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young to have a regular driver's license. He found that people under 20 years old often want to take risks for the fun of it. This makes sense. We should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens until this desire for risk-taking goes away. If we continue to give licenses to young teens, we will see many more accidents and the number of deaths will be very high. \n\nIn a few years, many more teens will be able to drive. By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road. We need laws to protect them. Schools can teach driver's education, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. A special permit could still be given before a regular license, and teens would still need to practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours could be the same as in most states. For example, in California, teens need 6 hours of driving with an adult and 50 hours of practice. National laws to protect teens would be a good way to make sure all teens are safe.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a good way to protect teens.",
            "I looked through the films at the Library of Congress. I decided to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to create illusions. My study of film looked at how these films work and why some of them are different from others.\n\nMost trick films at the time were made in a special setting. The camera did not move. It stayed in one place. The films used long shots and some medium shots. They did not use close-up shots. This is because of the way the films were made. The actors did not move towards or away from the camera. They only moved side to side.\n\nOne film, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, shows actors entering from one side and moving back and forth. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame. This is because the films were made like plays. The actors did not move up or down. They only moved side to side.\n\nMost tricks were short and simple. They were like magic tricks. They showed things disappearing or changing quickly. Some films were a little longer. But most were only a minute or less. They did not tell a story. They just showed a trick.\n\nBut some film makers tried something new. They joined two or more shots together to create an illusion. For example, a film of a person being beheaded is actually two shots. One shot shows the person being beheaded and another shot shows the head being removed. The viewer sees only one shot, but there are two physical shots.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republicanism. He was a farmer and had a short time in politics. This made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and the government. He thought farming was the best job. He used this idea to influence his thoughts about the government. He wanted to keep and grow a good system of farming.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a chance to make a perfect system of government. There was no old tradition to follow. This made it easy to create a new way of governing. He believed that all people are equal and that if one person is not free, none are. He thought the government should not control people's rights. He said that in nature, strong people take control. But in a civilization, this should not happen.\n\nTaylor wanted to make a government that knows people have good and bad inside. He thought a government should help people be good. He believed good principles are those that protect property, help farming, and stop people from being too rich. He thought a good government would work well, no matter who is in charge. He believed people are always acting in their own best interest. But if they only think of themselves, it is bad. He wanted a government to control people's bad behavior and keep them from hurting others.\n\nTaylor wanted a small federal government. It should only have the powers the Constitution says it has. He thought a big government is expensive and could be unfair. But he also thought a simple, direct reading of the Constitution could be wrong. He believed we should understand the ideas of the people who wrote it.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence is the true rule of the United States. It says the country is made up of many states, not one country. This is more clear than the Constitution.",
            "Look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people submitting their commuter logs in the third month of the project. This was a little disappointing. It is hard to know why this happened. Winter had just started at our school. Fewer people were walking or biking because of the cold weather. Many students were busy with schoolwork and preparing for grades. They may have forgotten to fill out the logs. The month of December is also a busy time of year. People have holidays and a long break from school. They do not need to come to campus. Classes started again in late January. This might be why there were few log submissions that month. However, this does not explain why there were few submissions for February. Perhaps the project got less exciting after the start. We had a lot of energy at the beginning. We created a special project, Carpool Challenge Week, to get people excited again in March. This worked and led to more log submissions. We had a problem keeping people interested, even with semester breaks and holidays. \n\nAnother problem with the project is that people like driving their cars. This is part of our culture. We need to give people reasons to use other ways to travel. We gave prizes to people, like gift cards to local stores and restaurants. This helped. But it might have been better to give bigger prizes, like a new bicycle or a new car. This could have kept people interested in the project.\n\nThe prizes did not change for a long time. If we had given bigger prizes, it might have helped. The prizes we were giving were good at first, but bigger prizes might have kept people interested in the project.",
            "An ETF is a special kind of investment. It is like an index fund, but it is more flexible. It trades like a stock on a stock exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of many investments, like an index fund. It also gives you the freedom to sell short, buy more, and buy just one share at a time.\n\nETFs have some good things. They are not very expensive. They are also very flexible. You can trade them easily. They come in many kinds. You can choose the right one for you.\n\nBut ETFs also have some bad things. You have to pay a fee to trade them. This is like paying a fee to buy a stock. Some people think this is not good.\n\nWe will look at an ETF called IHF. We will compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to know if it is better to buy the ETF or just the top 10 stocks. We will look at the return, or money made, and the risk, or how much money you might lose.\n\nWe will look at the 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF. We will use this information to calculate the return and risk of a portfolio made up of just these 10 stocks. This will help us understand if the ETF is a good choice.\n\nOur results show that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings has a higher return, or more money made, than the ETF. It also has a lower risk, or less money lost. This could be a good choice for an investor.\n\nBut we need to be careful. We need to make sure our results are correct. We will look at the standard deviation, or how much the stock's value can change, of each of the top 10 stocks. This will help us understand if the difference between the ETF and the portfolio of top 10 stocks is real or just a mistake.",
            "Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Poe got this word from the famous writer Virgil. Virgil wrote about Thulé as an island north of Britain that the Greeks thought was the end of the world.\n\nBut there is another source that Poe might have used. Poe liked German writers. There is a writer named Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who wrote a poem called \"Faust\". Goethe wrote \"Faust\" in two parts, the first part in 1808 and the second part in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". This poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. The king then starts drinking a lot and crying because he misses his wife. He decides it is time to die and gives all his things to his children except the cup. Then he goes to a high place, throws the cup into the water, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe King of Thulé and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. Maybe they are like two dark friends who both lost someone they loved. \"Faust\" was also made into a play by a man named Henry P. Grattan in 1842. This play was published just before Poe used the word Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe wrote about Thulé twice in his writings. He used the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and the phrase \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\". \"Dream-Land\" starts and ends with the word Thulé. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a dark and lonely place. He sees dead friends and a world without color. These scenes are similar to \"The King of Thulé\" where the king has lost his wife and is lonely.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known. Poe said he liked another writer who liked Goethe, Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe would have read Goethe's work in many copies that were published after the original.",
            "California law says a customer who is hurt after falling on applesauce in a grocery store can ask for more money as punishment. This is because the store manager knew about the spill twice and did not clean it up for 30 minutes.\n\nA judge is not likely to throw out Jennifer Palmer's claim. To get more money as punishment, Palmer must show that the store manager acted on purpose to ignore the danger. She must also show that his actions were bad and meant to hurt people. \n\nPalmer can say the store manager knew that not cleaning the spill could cause harm. Many people had fallen in the store in the months before she fell. The manager still did not clean the spill. Palmer can argue that the manager's actions were very bad and meant to hurt people.\n\nThe manager, Paul Martin, was eating dinner when he was told about the spill. He said he did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Later, another employee told him about the spill again, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Palmer fell and hurt her back. Before she fell, five other people had fallen in the store that year.\n\nCalifornia law says a person can get more money as punishment if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice means the person acted on purpose to hurt someone, or they did something very bad and ignored the danger. The law says conduct is malicious when a person is aware of the danger and does not try to stop it.\n\nIn a previous case, a court said a person's actions were malicious when they ignored the danger and knew the consequences would be bad. The court said the person acted on purpose to ignore the danger.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One big question we discussed was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is even more important today.  In the years since 9/11, I have seen the media's view of Islam change from negative to very positive in America.  It is hard to imagine that a president with a Muslim family background could be elected in 2001.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad interests me.  What I know of Muhammad's history does not match his personality.  I used to think Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam.  He would conquer cities and make the people believe in Islam.  But the biography of Muhammad says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to believe in him because of his good character, not because he was powerful.\n\nI also see some strange similarities between the jobs of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food so there was enough for many people.  This kind of writing makes me think the writers want Muhammad to be seen as a kind and humble man who did not need to prove anything.  This is not fair because it takes away from the importance of Jesus' life and work.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that make it seem like the writers are trying to show how people became Muslims on their own.  But some of these stories come from people who heard from other people, not from the people who actually knew Muhammad.  I do not like this because it makes the stories seem less important.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this book is that it says Muhammad was a good and humble man.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if people today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's history is interesting.  Let's look at it.  After Jesus died, the teachings he spread were not used in the development of Christianity.  Instead, the religion moved forward in a different way.  If we look at the history of Christianity in broad strokes, we see a trend of moving away from its start.  Today, people are becoming more aware and looking for change.  Some people still follow traditional ideas, but they are not as many as those who want something new.  People who believe in Jesus' ideas will become more aware of the history of their faith in the future.  A yearning will grow to know the real ideas of Jesus and the religion he started.  It may take a long time, but this will happen.  In the future, there will be a change.  People will try to remove the things that were added to Christianity over time.  They will go back to what Jesus taught.  This will be a big change.  It will be like going back in time.  There will be a movement to get back to the ideas Jesus taught.  When this happens, the United States and Europe will be affected.  People will start to worship like Jesus taught.  The church will still be strong, but the way people think will be the same.  There will be less difference between different groups.  This is happening in history.  It happened before.  The Romans used to persecute Christians, but later they became Christian.  Our country used to be unfair to African-Americans, but now they are leaders.  Something like this will happen in the Christian religion.  It will go back to its start.  To make this happen, people will read Jesus' words in a new way.  They will not take them as facts, but as examples.\n\nJesus lived a long time ago.  Before him, only one main religion existed: Judaism.  It was the root of Christianity.  The Jews believed in one God and the authority of their scriptures.  When the Romans took control of Jerusalem in sixty-three B.C., the Jewish people were not all the same.  They were divided into groups like the Sadducees and Pharisees.",
            "The Jungle is a book that shows human beings are very selfish. They want to make their lives better without thinking about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories are a good example. They only care about making their factories bigger and more successful. They do not think about anything that gets in their way or hurts anyone.\n\nThe book's writer, Upton Sinclair, describes the factories in a way that shows the damage they cause. He says the factories are very dirty and make a lot of smoke. He wants the reader to see how bad the situation is. The owners do not care about people or animals that get hurt by their factories. They do not care about the dirty water from the factories or the animals that live in the area.\n\nThe owners also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, not help their workers. They make their workers work very hard and then fire them without warning. During the time the book is set, there were no laws to protect workers. So, the owners could do what they wanted. The workers had to work in bad conditions and live in poor conditions too. They were like slaves.\n\nThe workers had no help or information to make their lives better. Some groups were formed to help workers, but they often made money off the workers instead. The workers were very unhappy and had no way to escape the bad situation. The Jungle says it is like this because the owners are very cruel and unfair.",
            "Many authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald often pairs an adjective and a noun together in a way that is not usual. He uses this to give readers a feeling about a subject. He also gives meaning to a symbol and then uses it to remind readers of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for white and gray. He uses these colors to remind readers of a feeling about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald makes white and gray mean the same thing: all the same. White is better and more important. Gray is old and faded. He starts to use these colors in the beginning of the book. People always wear white: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white clothes, and Tom wears a white shirt. Even the streets are white: \"the white chasms of lower New York\".\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors to describe common things: the names of people are gray, a child is gray, and a man is gray. He does this to show that these things are not important.\n\nAfter building up meaning for white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to show that something is not important. He starts by describing Daisy in white clothes. Readers begin to see Daisy as not a person, but just something that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique again to show that Daisy is not important.\n\nFitzgerald also uses this technique with other colors, including gold, green, red, and pink. He builds up meaning for these colors and then uses them to remind readers of a feeling about important objects.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Farmers grow many kinds of food there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Many people in the area want to buy food from local farms that do not use chemicals. This is called organic food. There is a big market for this type of food in San Diego. Many people have to wait to buy it.\n\nFarmers who grow organic food often give tours of their farms. People can walk around, look at the plants and animals, and learn about farming. This can be a good way for farmers to make money. It can also help people understand how food is grown.\n\nGrowing organic food has some problems. It takes more work and time to remove pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without chemicals. It is also more expensive than growing food using chemicals. A small farm cannot produce as much food as a big farm. But organic farming helps the environment. It makes the area have more plants and animals. This is good for the land, the water, and the people who live there.\n\nThe land in this story is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land with different kinds of plants and trees. It is next to a forest. Many kinds of plants and animals live there. Some are in danger of disappearing. Others are getting less common.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. Before the farmers came, Native Americans lived there. Then, people raised cattle and cut down trees for wood. This land was used for farming for many years.\n\nI chose this land to study what a farmer might do to make farming less expensive and to help the plants and animals. I found an organic farm in the same area to use as an example.",
            "Culture is important in any talk. It is not easy to understand. A talk between people from different cultures can be difficult. To make a good agreement, it is helpful to understand a culture's values and ways. Culture is not the same for everyone. \n\nWhen we meet people from a different culture, we compare their ways to our own. We try to learn about their history and what they think is important. We do not try to change their ways. We accept them for what they are. This is especially true in talks where one side has more power.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies have their own culture too. For example, some companies work long hours. Others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its workers dress and talk. Some companies want their workers to help charities. Others do not.\n\nDifferent people within a culture have different ideas. This can be true even within the same company. Some people from other cultures may seem the same but are not. We should not just look at the surface. We need to look deeper.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is important. These values tell us why people act a certain way. If people value being polite, they will not argue in public. If people value getting a good deal, they will not give in easily. We should learn about our opponent's values before a talk. This will help us make a good agreement.",
            "People believe in a higher power. One Bible passage says: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is in the Christian Bible's Psalm 14. A man named St. Anselm wrote about God's existence. Another person, Thomas Aquinas, also wrote about God. Both men wanted to prove that God exists. They wrote their ideas in the same time period, so we will look at their ideas together.\n\nLet's assume both men are right about God. This is because we are trying to compare their ideas. If we think of a different kind of higher power, it will not be fair to compare their ideas. They wrote about the same God, the one in the Bible.\n\nWe will look at St. Anselm's idea first. He said people can find God inside themselves. He said we can see that God exists in our own minds. We don't need to look outside ourselves for proof. This idea is like faith. Faith means believing something without proof. Many Christian texts say that faith is important.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas had a different idea. He said we can prove God exists using reason and evidence. We don't need faith. This idea is good for telling people about God. It can help people join the Christian church. They can believe in God because of logic, not just because of faith. St. Thomas said there are five logical reasons to believe in God: change, cause and effect, things that exist but could not exist, levels of perfection, and order. He said we can understand God's existence by using these ideas. We can know about God without seeing him.",
            "A long time ago, around five hundred years before Christ, a prince was born. This prince would one day be called Buddha. He lived a long life and became enlightened. His teachings created Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is a very old religion. It is more than two thousand five hundred years old. It looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in the country of Sri Lanka. The people there observe a special ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony.\n\nMany people, both monks and laymen, take part in this ceremony. It has meaning, even though Buddha never taught about a celebration like this. The differences between Buddhism today and in Buddha's time are many. They can be seen in many things, from the small traditions to the main ideas of the religion.\n\nThe Buddhist community has had to change its main ideas over time. This has happened because of forces both from outside and inside the community. The community is made up of people who follow Buddha's teachings. Forces from outside the community are from people who do not believe in Buddhism.\n\nWe need to know some important words to understand what we are talking about. An internal force is a force that comes from people inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a force that comes from people outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is a force that hurts the community. A benign force is a force that does not hurt or help the community.\n\nWe will use these words a lot in this discussion. Now, let's talk about the main ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of three parts: the Tripitaka. This has many texts that explain Buddhism. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world. These ideas include no soul, suffering in life, and that everything is changing.\n\nBy understanding these ideas, people can stop the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. It happens over and over. Along with stopping Sansara, people can also stop desire, hatred, and delusion. These are the things that come from being not enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for how to live. For people who are not monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave improperly with someone of the opposite sex, and do not take drugs. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped.",
            "Two countries, the United States and Mexico, had a long rivalry. It lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry had a big fight, the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The United States won and took Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThe two countries had many other fights. They disagreed on issues like religion, culture, and tradition. They also disagreed on things they wanted like money and trade. This is like many other countries that have rivalries with their neighbors. \n\nWhen countries share a border, they often have disagreements. This can create problems between the countries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with long rivalries. They share a border and have had many disagreements.\n\nOne reason for the rivalry was a difference in religion. The United States and Mexico had different views on what was important. This was a big problem between the two countries. Many other countries have had disagreements over religion throughout history.\n\nA long time ago, the English and Spanish had a disagreement. This feeling of distrust was passed down to the United States and Mexico. This made it hard for the two countries to be friends.\n\nThere were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these fights were about territory and who controlled the land. There were also problems with people crossing the border and causing trouble.\n\nAs time went on, Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States' goals changed from wanting more land to wanting to help Mexico. This helped end the rivalry between the two countries.",
            "Fifteen years ago I became very sick. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job because I wanted a safe and secure life. I did not have a safe and secure life when I was a child. People said, \"You will always have a job. People will always get sick.\" So, I chose nursing. I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow I am 46 years old and I am not working. I do not have much money. I get a little money from the government, but it is not enough. I get by, but it is hard every day. I am not safe or secure anymore. But I know one thing: I could not have made it without my family and a few good friends. They helped me a lot. When bad things happen, it is hard to feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. We cannot prepare for everything. Some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nI agree that we should not put all our trust in the government. It is not strong. I think we should learn to trust each other again. We should help each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe people who want to be independent say that is how America was built. But it was not just independence that helped them. They had compassion, respect for each other, and shared their resources.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a kit with food, water, and other things I need in case of an emergency. I also have a first aid kit and a way to purify water. If you have a farm and can grow your own food, that is a good idea. But also get to know your neighbors and ask for help if you need it.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? Even a long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that scientists have not yet found a way to explain the simplest living things in a simple way. Today, scientists are using math to understand how living things grow and change. Recently, math was used to study how mollusks, a group of animals with shells, grow their shells. Our study is trying to use math to understand how living things change over time. We are using math to study how a type of mollusk called Prunum grows its shell.\n\nTo do this, we used pictures of Prunum shells to find numbers that we can use to model how the shell grows. We used a special computer program called CerioShell to create models of what the shell might look like. These models can help us understand how living things can change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It grows around a center point, and it has lines that separate each part of the shell. We can count how many parts there are and study how they grow. We can also study how the shell grows as the animal moves through time and space.\n\nWe can use math to show how the shell grows and change over time. This can help us understand how living things change and grow. We can use this information to create new ideas about how living things change over time.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that grows in a circle. The circle is divided into parts called whorls. Each whorl is like a ring that grows around the center of the shell. The center of the shell is called the columella. The whorls grow around the columella, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. The last whorl is the biggest, and the rest of the shell is called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways, such as from the top, bottom, or side. We can also count the whorls by drawing a line from the top and counting the parts. We can use math to show how the shell grows and changes over time.\n\nWe can study how the shell grows by tracing the path of the aperture. The aperture is the opening of the shell, and we can use math to show how it changes over time. This can help us understand how living things change and grow.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years.  Indonesia is making progress on some of the goals set for the year 2015, like providing clean water and sanitation.  But the country is not improving as quickly as it needs to on health for mothers and babies.  We will look at the reasons for this below.  They show that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger, not just improve specific programs.\n\nMore women in Indonesia are giving birth with a trained health worker.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  However, this number still includes traditional workers who cannot help if the birth is complicated.  Many mothers die because of bleeding after childbirth.  So, the progress in this area is not as good as it seems.  There are also fewer children with diarrhea who visit a health professional.  We do not have complete information on care for new mothers.  But it is clear that this is a problem.  Many areas of the country have low rates of care for new mothers.\n\nNot enough women in Indonesia have a C-section when they need one.  Only 4% of births are C-sections.  The percentage is higher in cities, 7%, but lower in rural areas, 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  This is a problem of fairness.  Another problem is that people who are poor have a harder time getting healthcare.  There is a 27% gap in who uses healthcare services between the richest and poorest people.  The poor cannot afford to pay out of their own money for healthcare.\n\nThe next question is how to make healthcare better for babies and mothers.  The main question is how to make sure there are enough healthcare services.  Should Indonesia develop special programs or make its healthcare system better?  It is clear that special programs can solve specific problems.  They have clear goals and can give quick results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  One problem is that if we spend a lot of money on one area, we may not have enough money for other areas.  Also, many programs can make it hard to coordinate services and give too much paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed stories about people of high social class in England during that time. But two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting. These elements help readers understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses strange and confusing ideas to show Oliver's feelings. For example: \"He was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were yelling. The words they said sounded in his ears. When he finally paid attention, he found he was talking to them.\" Oliver is very confused and scared. The strange visions make the reader understand how Oliver feels.\n\nThe strange events in Oliver Twist often happen in Oliver's dreams. These dreams show the reader what is wrong with Oliver and what he is feeling. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers the shooting of his friend. He relives the event in his mind, like a dream. Oliver is very scared and does not know what is happening. He is also very hurt and in a lot of pain.\n\nOliver has no control over what happens to him. He does not try to stop the bad things that happen. The shooting in the story shows that Oliver has no control over his life. He is influenced by the people around him, like the bad man Fagin. This makes Oliver feel defeated and without hope.\n\nWuthering Heights is another novel that uses strange and confusing events to make the characters more interesting. The author writes: \"The day passed quickly. There was no day – it was gone as soon as it started. The night was long and quiet, but it passed quickly.\"",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped Elementary age students with their studies. I was good at English and reading. The program's instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. He was having trouble reading. I helped him for a time, but I saw that something was not right. Some letters he read well, but others he did not understand. He spoke perfect English, but this was strange.\n\nI asked his mother for help. She did not speak English. I spoke a little Spanish, but not much. We tried to talk, but it was hard. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. I hope this helped him.\n\nI tell this story because there is a big problem in schools: the language barrier. This is a big problem in California. Even a child who speaks good English can have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what can we do? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading helped. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one answer. We need to use many approaches.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps children who speak Spanish, and all children. Children in bilingual programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit. How can we do this? We do not need all teachers to be bilingual. But we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "Most people are told from a young age that there is something bigger than them in the world. This idea is often taught in school or church. Some people learn about it in Sunday school, others in Temple, and some find their own answers. Many people accept the ideas of their parents. But some people reject these ideas and think there is nothing beyond what they can see and touch.\n\nWe look for answers to big questions about life. We want to know what is out there and what it means. We search for a way to understand the world. We try to find a light in the dark to guide us.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on a porch together. It was raining and the sound of the rain was loud. He looked out into the rain and seemed to be thinking about something. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and scared because I knew he was going to die soon.\n\nMy father died in December, a few days after my birthday. He was sick and the doctors were trying to help him, but it was not working. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he was when he was sick. I thought if God was real, he would not let my father suffer. I did not say any prayers.\n\nI did not want to see my father die. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days.

            "The Gothic Novel is a strange name for a story about old and new ideas. Ian Watt says it is like an \"oxymoron\" - two things that do not mix. People have criticized the Gothic mode for not being deep, and also praised it for its powerful and exciting parts. \n\nThe first Gothic Novel was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He used old ideas from \"ancient\" romances and new ideas from modern novels to create the Gothic style. He mixed old theatrical elements with new ways of writing to make a new kind of story. \n\nThe Gothic style uses many old ideas from medieval times, like old buildings and old traditions. Even when \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things, like old peoples and old styles. It was seen as old-fashioned compared to new ideas in society and literature.\n\nThe mix of old and new ideas is what makes the Gothic style interesting. It stays interesting for a long time, even if the reader is far from the time when it was written. \n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic stories is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It was important to Gothic writers because it represented a perfect knight who was brave, honorable, and good. They saw that society was not living up to this ideal, and they wanted to change it. \n\nThe idea of chivalry was used in \"The Castle of Otranto\" to make the past seem better than the present. This was a way of saying that society had lost something important. The writer, Horace Walpole, was writing during a difficult time in history. He was unhappy with the way society was going, and he wanted to make people think about what was important. \n\nOne character in the story, Frederic, is a good example of a chivalric knight. He is a prince who has been through hard times and is a good person. His description in the story includes many traditional ideas about chivalry, like being a gallant and courteous knight.",
            "Supply Chain Management\n------------------------\n\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order to the customer. It includes the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution. The term supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to provide good customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to understand what customers need. The market is a good guide to decide what customers demand. Managers decide what products to make and how many. They also choose where to make the products, considering customer demand and satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to plan workloads and maintenance. Production is a very important part. Every detail matters. If details are not planned correctly, it can cost a company time and money.\n\nSupply is the second key part of the supply chain. It includes making strategic decisions about a company's capabilities and partnerships. A company may have many divisions for a single product. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They may also outsource work to other companies to save time and money.\n\nInventory is the third key part. It includes storing and managing goods before they are sold. Location is the fourth part. It includes choosing the best place to make and store products. Transportation is the fifth part. It includes moving goods from one place to another. Information is the sixth part. It includes sharing information between companies and customers.\n\nManagers use these six parts to provide good customer service. They make sure the right products are made, stored, and delivered to customers on time. This helps a company be successful.",
            "There is a message in Burma. It says Hitler is alive.\n\nEllen Page, the actress from the movie Juno, stands alone on the street with a piece of cardboard. She holds it up, and the message is written on it in black. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a group of military leaders who took power in 1962. They did not win power through an election.\n\nIn 2007, people on the street began to protest. This was the first time people had protested in ten years. The protests were led by monks. The monks wore yellow robes. After the first protests, more and more people joined in. The government was not happy. The government did not want people to protest.\n\nThe government allowed the monks to meet peacefully, but then the situation became violent. The military attacked the monks and their monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested. One journalist was killed while he was reporting on the protests.\n\nThis is not the only time that a government has tried to stop people from speaking out against it. Many governments throughout history have tried to stop people from protesting. In ancient Rome, the emperor thought they were chosen by the gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor is thought to be a god. In the United States, the president had meetings with a man who leads a group that is against freedom.\n\nThere are many examples of governments hurting their own people. In 1989, people in China protested against their government. The government did not like this, and many people were killed. In Rwanda, a group of people killed anyone who was not like them. Germany, under Hitler, killed many Jewish people.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Governments have been hurting their own people for a long time.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He lived a long life, which helped him create many new and important works of music for his orchestra. In many of his compositions, Ellington's piano playing is not very loud. However, as a composer, he was very good at making music that showed each member of the band. He created a framework for band members to play with freedom. Ellington also wrote music that was tightly organized and used the special style of each band member to show musical ideas. This created a new and original sound for each piece.\n\nEllington was very good at understanding how to make each band member sound good. He knew how to make the band sound good together as a group. This skill allowed him to write some of the most innovative and great music in jazz history.\n\nIn his music, Ellington often used the voice to add a new sound to his music. This is shown in his song \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, he used the voice as a musical instrument. It was one of the first times he did this in his career. The song is a slow, twelve-bar blues that has six parts. Each part is different.\n\nPart 1: The song starts with a call and response between the voice and the reeds. The voice starts with a smooth sound and then becomes rougher at the end.\nPart 2: A muted trumpet player plays a solo. The solo makes the melody more interesting and uses many blue notes.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast, high solo while the piano plays a subtle rhythm.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nPart 5: The reeds start the call and response in a high voice. The brass and rhythm sections play a strong, rhythmic pattern.\nPart 6: The song returns to the first part, with a call and response between the voice and the reeds. In this part, the voice sounds like a musical instrument.\n\nIn another song, \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington uses his skill at making tight music with his band. He also uses his ear to make new and interesting sounds. In this song, a trumpet player and a singer use their voices to create a rich sound.\n\nIn \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington uses a trombone player to make the melody sound new and interesting.",

Three years later, at 17, she was still feeling this way. She wanted something, but not a thing. She wanted a person. But she was not interested in any boy. Some boys liked her, but she did not like them. She often thought about what could be causing this. She thought about it for a long time, but she did not know the answer.\n\nHer home life was usually peaceful. Her parents were calm and nice people. They did not argue. They were not angry with her.

            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" affects the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study found that eating a diet high in plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and low in animal products and saturated fats, can reduce this risk.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that eating a Mediterranean-style diet can help people live longer and prevent heart disease. However, this study focused on the connection between the diet and stroke.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women were part of a larger study of nurses in 11 US states. The researchers asked the women about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. They found that women who ate a Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nTo make sure the results were accurate, the researchers looked at medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates to confirm cases of heart disease and stroke. They also accounted for other factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. In fact, women who ate the most Mediterranean-style foods were 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke than those who ate the least.\n\nThis study shows that eating a Mediterranean-style diet can be an effective way to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. This diet is not only good for the heart, but it may also help people live longer and healthier lives.",
            "The United States had a big financial crisis in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and some big companies were in trouble. This problem is still a problem today. So, we must ask: how did this problem happen and how can we stop it? The financial crisis happened because of bad and foolish decisions made by politicians. They pushed banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks and companies then sold these loans to other places, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These companies mixed the loans together and sold them to others. When the people who borrowed the money could not pay, the banks and companies were in trouble. \n\nThis problem began in 1999. President Clinton wanted a second term in office. He wanted to be popular. So, he made it easier for banks to give loans to people who could not afford them. A reporter at the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to give loans to people who earn little money. The company wanted to grow and make more money.\" The reporter said this could cause big problems if the economy slowed down. And it did. \n\nSome new kinds of loans were used to buy homes. These loans had rates that could change, and they were complicated. They were mixed together and sold to many people. This made many people borrow too much money. When the housing market fell, they could not pay back the money. The big banks and companies that bought these loans were in trouble. They lost $4.1 trillion dollars in 2007. This is a big number. It is one-third of the country's total money. Some companies were sold, and some were forced to change the way they work. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion dollars in loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",

It's like a guest that you don't want to invite to your party.\n\nWe already know the rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes.  She writes a lot of words that tell the reader what happened.  And it makes the reader bored.\n\nExposition is when you tell the reader about the story.

You read a story and you learn that a woman met her husband a long time ago.  They got married in a big ceremony.  And then he died in front of her.  But you don't want to read about all of it happening in a few lines.  You want to see the husband's character.  You want to see how much he loved her.  And you want to see how much she loved him.\n\nIf the story tells you that she was happy with him, you want to see it in her words and actions.  You want to see her smile when she thinks of him.  You want to see her cry when she remembers him.  That way, you can feel her sadness.  And you can feel her love for him.\n\nSo, as a writer, you need to give the reader more.

            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live this morning (August 13, 2011) on NBC 4. The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler. He stabbed his wife many times in Ashley, Ohio. He was arrested. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news was only two minutes long. I think it was enough time.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically hurt. Police did not have any suspects. A special police team was working on the case. I thought this story was short. I think it was because the man who was shot was black and from a black neighborhood. I have noticed that the news does not give as much attention to minorities who are victims of crimes. If a white person is a victim, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a gun hole in a helicopter. It was a .22 caliber bullet that hit the helicopter. Police want people to tell them who did it. They will give a reward of five thousand dollars to anyone who helps.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid to low eighties. The news did not talk about this for very long.\n\nThey also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man robbed the store. He wore a black sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought the news talked about this man being black a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug seller in Texas. He was in a group that sold marijuana in Ohio from Texas. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison. The news also said he was Hispanic. I did not think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special friendship between brothers. It is a strong and unbreakable bond. This friendship has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. They see themselves in each other. In hard times, this bond is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they make a big difference. Part of understanding brotherly love is dealing with the problems it causes. When you look at your brother, you see yourself. You see the good and the bad. Your actions and what happens because of them show who you really are. The story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this. Two brothers go on a difficult journey. They have many strong feelings. In the end, one brother survives, but the other does not. The story shows how one of the brothers feels proud and resentful towards his brother. The brother wants a brother he can play with and teach things to. But his brother is very sick and cannot do these things. The brother is very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels happy and loving. This shows that he cares about his brother. This is a complex feeling that shows the love and anger of brotherhood.\n\nThe main character's actions are driven by one main feeling: pride. He wants a brother who can play with him and learn from him. He wants a brother who can run and climb with him. But his brother is very sick and cannot do these things. The brother is very sad and angry that his brother cannot be the brother he wants. This is shown when he thinks about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels happy and loving.

They compared it to a tablet made of wax, then to a piece of paper, and now to a computer. These ideas are useful, but they have limits. They can also lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. These are like special helpers that turn what we see, hear, touch, and taste into signals. The brain uses these signals to make decisions. It does this in two parts: bottom-up and top-down. \n\nImagine you see a picture of a black box on a white background. The bottom-up process looks at the picture and says, \"I see some black and white colors, and some lines that mean this is a box.\" The top-down process uses this information to say, \"I know this is a box, not a hole in the white background.\" \n\nWhen the brain gets information, it decides how important it is. This helps choose what we pay attention to. For example, we might see many blades of grass, but we only notice a few. We might also hear our name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information in three types: sensory, working, and long-term. We get sensory information from our senses. Working memory stores information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Long-term memory keeps information for a long time. Scientists think that working memory is like a short signal that goes through some brain cells. Long-term memory is like a special kind of protein that keeps the information.\n\nThere are many theories about how we organize our knowledge in the brain. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some come from computer science, and some come from studying the brain. One idea is that our brain has small places that connect to each other. These places are like concepts, and they connect to each other because they are related. For example, our brain might connect the idea of a \"chair\" to the idea of a \"table,\" which is connected to the idea of \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "The writer Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of new technology and the way it is supported by the system of capitalism. In his novel Brave New World, he pictures a bad future where people value groups over individuals and seek happiness right away. People are taught from a young age to choose pleasure above all else. The citizens are shown to be controlled by a single system, ruled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. \n\nIf we look at the book through the ideas of Marxism, we can see that the writer is warning us about the problems of the economy of his time. Huxley uses special words from Marxism, such as the idea of equality for everyone being the same, and how people are controlled by the rules of society.\n\nHuxley makes fun of capitalism in the book by showing how the common people are not aware of their relationship with the more powerful people in society. They are only interested in getting richer and more things. This is because the system is designed to keep them from knowing the truth. The people in the book, like the Delta and Gamma classes, do not have their own ideas. They are forced to follow the rules and buy things they do not need.\n\nThe wealthy people in the book are in control and do nothing to change the system. The interactions between the different people in the book show that they are very unkind to each other. They do not really know each other, and they do not care about each other's feelings. The writer may be saying that the rise of new technology and capitalism takes away people's freedom and ability to express themselves.\n\nThe people in the book do not have real love or deep feelings. They are only interested in looking good and having fun. The way the people in the different classes accept their place in society shows how the system of capitalism affects people's lives. They are happy to obey the rules and stay in line with what is expected of them.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. It can be hard for students to get around campus. My first year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls. It is far from many buildings, including the Willard building. It takes me 25 minutes to walk from my home to classes in Willard when the weather is bad. I talked to an older student and learned that the East Halls were once separated from the rest of the school by empty land. Now, that space has buildings, sports fields and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to get from one place to another. A good solution is the bicycle. But students must ride them and the campus needs to help.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Bicycles are good for your body. They are also the fastest way to travel. A simple breakfast and some exercise will take you 30 miles or more. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. The smartest thing I did was buy a bike. I ride to Thomas building for class. It takes me 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The problem is, Pollock Road is not an easy road to ride on.\n\nThere are good things about walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That is two and a half hours every week. I don't have time for that."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models of a sleep problem called insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder. There are two main ways to look at this problem: the Biological model and the Sociocultural model. The Biological model looks at genetics and health. The Sociocultural model looks at how the environment and things like race, ethnicity, and income affect sleep.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by many things, including other mental health problems, medical conditions, or substances. There are many types of sleep problems. Some are called Dyssomnias, which are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Others are called Parasomnias, which are problems with strange behaviors during sleep.\n\nDyssomnias include insomnia, which is a problem falling asleep or staying asleep. Hypersomnia is a problem staying awake. Narcolepsy is a problem with staying awake and alert. Breathing-related sleep disorder and circadian rhythm sleep disorder are other types of Dyssomnias. The biological model says that genetics and health can cause these problems.\n\nOne study looked at mice to understand how genes affect sleep. The study found that certain receptors in the brain help control sleep and wakefulness. These receptors can be affected by genetics, which can cause sleep problems. This study shows that genetics can affect sleep, which is good to know for people with insomnia.\n\nThe Sociocultural model looks at how the environment and society affect sleep. For example, people from different cultures or with different incomes may have different sleep patterns. A study found that certain genetic receptors in the brain can be affected by genetics, which can cause sleep problems. This means that people with certain genetic traits may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThis study is important because it shows that genetics can affect sleep. If people have a genetic problem that affects sleep, it can make it hard for them to focus and do daily tasks. This can affect their lives in many ways.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). We will explain what CAPD is, how it is diagnosed, and ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nCAPD is a disorder of the brain. It means the brain has trouble understanding what we hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain does not work correctly to understand them. This is not the same as being deaf. A person with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain has trouble separating different sounds or understanding what is being said.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first discovered in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. They developed tests to help diagnose the problem. In 1954, Italian researchers started testing children. They found that the brain has trouble with certain sounds and voices.\n\nCAPD can affect people in different ways. They may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may not be able to tell the difference between two sounds at the same time. They may not understand patterns of sound or changes in voice. They may also have trouble understanding what someone is saying.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors and specialists use tests. They observe how a person listens and responds to sounds. They may use special tools to measure how the brain works. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in several ways. The teacher can use visual aids, such as pictures or videos, to help the student understand what is being said. The teacher can also use simple language and repeat instructions. They can give the student extra time to understand what is being said. The teacher can also provide a quiet space for the student to work and listen.",
            "Twelfth Night is a play that says hiding the truth can be useful in many cases. But in the end, a person must decide whether to reveal the truth or keep hiding. If they tell the truth, they may lose relationships with others. If they keep hiding, they may lose themselves.\n\nThe play also talks about people hiding their true selves by pretending to be the opposite sex. This is a big problem because it makes people ask why they do this. Why do they want to hide who they are? In the play, a character named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself from harm. She is good at pretending and people believe she is a man. But she loses her friends and has to deal with love feelings from two people - one man and one woman.\n\nThe play shows how hiding the truth can help people find their feelings. Viola's pretending helps one man find love with her, but it also makes things complicated. The man, Orsino, had feelings for Viola when she was pretending to be a man. Now he is confused. The woman, Olivia, loves Viola when she thinks she is a man, but when she finds out, she loves Viola's twin brother, Sebastian.\n\nThe play makes people think about why people hide who they are. Is Olivia really in love with women, or does she just look at people's appearance? The play says it is not easy to know what people really feel. Olivia easily changes her feelings from one person to another. She loves Viola when she thinks Viola is a man, but when she finds out she is a woman, Olivia loves Viola's twin brother.",
            "The German empire in Africa was known for its harsh treatment of local people. One example is the Ovaherero and Nama groups in German South West Africa. However, this is not a complete picture of the German empire. The way Germany ruled its colonies varied a lot. Even the way it provided education was different in each place. \n\nIn 1919, Britain took control of German East Africa (now called Tanganyika). They found many Africans who were well-educated and could read and write. Germany's education efforts in other colonies, like Kamerun, were also praised by people who lived at the time. \n\nBut South West Africa (now Namibia) was a different story. The government in East Africa built schools for local people and gave them a big role in education. In South West Africa, the job of educating the local people was left to missionary groups who got little help from the government. The government did invest in education for European people in the colony. They built schools and controlled missionary schools. \n\nThe government's choices had a lasting effect on South West Africa. Many other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people remained uneducated and unable to read. Many things caused the difference between South West Africa and other colonies. This paper will look at these things and what happened in South West Africa, especially what settlers and government officials thought about the local people.\n\nThere is a lot written about education in the German empire. Much of this writing is in German and was done a long time ago. The early writing mostly described how education was done in the different colonies. Later writing in English compared education in different colonies and looked at specific parts of education in more detail. These studies showed that each colony had a different education system. One of the most important studies is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the many European settlers in South West Africa explained many of the differences in the colony's education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a warm climate, but much of the land is desert. This is why there were a lot of European settlers in South West Africa. By 1913, about 15,000 Europeans lived there. Only about 5,300 Europeans lived in the colony with the next largest number of settlers, East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a popular music style that has grown very much over the last 100 years. Many people think it is very difficult to list all the different kinds of heavy metal music. It is even harder because many of these kinds of music have smaller groups within them. One of the most interesting kinds of heavy metal music is called heavy metal rock. It has many different emotions, mostly dark and unhappy ones. It is also very different because people started to make their own kinds of heavy metal music a long time ago. This led to smaller groups of music, and this chain of smaller groups continues today.\n\nToday, heavy metal music is very hard to understand because it has many different kinds of music in it. But to understand it, we must first know what heavy metal music is and why it is a special kind of music.\n\nHeavy metal music is a kind of music that is often about the darker side of life. It is music with more sound, more volume, and more energy. People who play heavy metal music are very good at playing their instruments, and you can hear this in their music. Heavy metal music also has a connection to drugs. Many people used drugs to create some of the first heavy metal music in the 1970s. This music had many strange and unusual qualities that were new to the music world. Later, other kinds of heavy metal music took some of these qualities from other kinds of music, like the Romantic Era. Some examples of heavy metal music show how dark and unhappy it can be:\n\nThese words from the song Helter Skelter show the darker side of music. They talk about the ups and downs of life, and some people think this song was one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a song by the Rolling Stones that was also very heavy and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music just as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau: A Dream of Acceptance\n\nHenri Rousseau painted a very special picture called \"The Dream\" in 1910. This painting shows a woman looking at wonderful things in a dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted other artists and people who love art to accept and praise him. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he also wanted to be himself and paint in his own way.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know a little about his life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a hardware seller. Rousseau did not go to school to learn about art. Instead, he worked for many years for the government. He became a toll collector and was known as a customs officer.\n\nRousseau's life was very sad. His wife and many of their children died. He was left with only one child, a daughter named Julia. He started painting to help him feel better and to start a new life. Rousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful and romantic pictures of peasants. He was a folk painter who painted about the things people in his class thought about.\n\nRousseau wanted the art world to accept him. He started painting late in life and was working at the same time as many other famous artists. It was hard for him to get recognition. It was not until around the same time that another artist, Matisse, became famous that Rousseau started to get the recognition he wanted. A writer named Jan Gordon said that Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to be a good painter and not paint in a boring way. Rousseau just wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as an artist.",
            "Many great thinkers believe that ethics and aesthetics are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same. I agree with this idea. As the great poet John Keats once said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn about many things in life through education or experience. But we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics in a different way. We try to explain what is good or beautiful, not make rules for art or behavior.\n\nWhen we talk about art or morals, we can't fully describe what makes something good or beautiful. For example, we can talk about the colors, shapes, and context of a painting like the Mona Lisa. But these things don't explain why it's a great work of art. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's something about it\" that they can't explain.\n\nI believe that both art and morals have a special quality that can't be fully described. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way. . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" We can describe art and morals, but there's always something more.\n\nI think that this is why ethics and aesthetics are connected. We experience both of them in a deep way that can't be fully explained. This is especially true for literature. Literature has a special ability to teach us about values and morals. As the writer McKean said, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. It's as important to our lives as our values themselves.\"",
            "Germany is a strong country with its own culture. This culture comes from many different groups of people. You can feel it in the great cities of Germany, from München near the Alps to the city of Kiel near the Baltic Sea.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many different tribes lived in this area. They came from many places. The name 'Germany' comes from these tribes. But its meaning is not clear.\n\nThe Roman writer Tacitus said the name came from a group of people called the Tungrians. They were also called Germans before they crossed the Rhine River and fought the Gauls. The Roman leader Julius Caesar used the word 'Germanus' in his writings about the wars he fought against the Gauls. Caesar got the word from the Gauls themselves. He used it to talk about the people he had not yet defeated.\n\nSome people think the name 'Germany' comes from a spear used by the Germans in war. Others think it comes from the Old Irish word 'garim', which means 'to shout'. This may mean the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman writer Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum'. He said the Germans were the first people to live in the area. They did not come from other places. They were not mixed with other groups of people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They sent soldiers to the area to get goods and to fight. But they mostly stayed in their own country. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and skills with the Romans.",
            "I looked down at the picture before me.  My mind was empty.  I was not feeling any strong feelings.  I was simply looking at the view.  My brain was working quickly.  It was taking in the picture and then moving on.  I did not have strong thoughts about what I was seeing.  I was just observing.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  An artist told me to buy it.  It teaches people how to draw.  One thing it says is to draw a square around a picture.  This makes it easier to understand.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit.  But I could not imagine a square around it.  I was too busy looking at all the details.  I was amazed.\n\nMany famous artists, like Picasso and Monet, have their own ways of seeing the world.  I wanted to be an artist too.  I wanted to create something special.  I wanted to make a good picture.\n\nMy hand reached for a pencil.  I was ready to start drawing.  But then I thought about something else.  My hand went to the toilet handle.  I had to move something that was stuck.\n\nI grabbed a mop and a piece of toilet paper.  I put the mop on the floor and stood up straight.  Then I bent down and put my hand into the toilet.  It was not easy.  But I did it.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many things cause this problem. One reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teens also do not have much experience driving. This lack of experience causes more accidents and increases the number of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nWhen teens drive with their friends, the risk of an accident is even higher. A study in Southern California found a connection between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states are trying to make driving safer for teens. They require special temporary licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and do not allow other minors as passengers. But these special licenses are just temporary solutions. The real problem is that teens, as a group, are not able to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.\n\nA psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young to have a regular driver's license. He found that people under 20 years old often want to take risks for the fun of it. This makes sense. We should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens until this desire for risk-taking goes away. If we continue to give licenses to young teens, we will see many more accidents and the number of deaths will be very high. \n\nIn a few years, many more teens will be able to drive. By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road. We need laws to protect them. Schools can teach driver's education, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. A special permit could still be given before a regular license, and teens would still need to practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours could be the same as in most states. For example, in California, teens need 6 hours of driving with an adult and 50 hours of practice. National laws to protect teens would be a good way to make sure all teens are safe.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a good way to protect teens.",
            "I looked through the films at the Library of Congress. I decided to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to create illusions. My study of film looked at how these films work and why some of them are different from others.\n\nMost trick films at the time were made in a special setting. The camera did not move. It stayed in one place. The films used long shots and some medium shots. They did not use close-up shots. This is because of the way the films were made. The actors did not move towards or away from the camera. They only moved side to side.\n\nOne film, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, shows actors entering from one side and moving back and forth. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame. This is because the films were made like plays. The actors did not move up or down. They only moved side to side.\n\nMost tricks were short and simple. They were like magic tricks. They showed things disappearing or changing quickly. Some films were a little longer. But most were only a minute or less. They did not tell a story. They just showed a trick.\n\nBut some film makers tried something new. They joined two or more shots together to create an illusion. For example, a film of a person being beheaded is actually two shots. One shot shows the person being beheaded and another shot shows the head being removed. The viewer sees only one shot, but there are two physical shots.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republicanism. He was a farmer and had a short time in politics. This made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and the government. He thought farming was the best job. He used this idea to influence his thoughts about the government. He wanted to keep and grow a good system of farming.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a chance to make a perfect system of government. There was no old tradition to follow. This made it easy to create a new way of governing. He believed that all people are equal and that if one person is not free, none are. He thought the government should not control people's rights. He said that in nature, strong people take control. But in a civilization, this should not happen.\n\nTaylor wanted to make a government that knows people have good and bad inside. He thought a government should help people be good. He believed good principles are those that protect property, help farming, and stop people from being too rich. He thought a good government would work well, no matter who is in charge. He believed people are always acting in their own best interest. But if they only think of themselves, it is bad. He wanted a government to control people's bad behavior and keep them from hurting others.\n\nTaylor wanted a small federal government. It should only have the powers the Constitution says it has. He thought a big government is expensive and could be unfair. But he also thought a simple, direct reading of the Constitution could be wrong. He believed we should understand the ideas of the people who wrote it.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence is the true rule of the United States. It says the country is made up of many states, not one country. This is more clear than the Constitution.",
            "Look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people submitting their commuter logs in the third month of the project. This was a little disappointing. It is hard to know why this happened. Winter had just started at our school. Fewer people were walking or biking because of the cold weather. Many students were busy with schoolwork and preparing for grades. They may have forgotten to fill out the logs. The month of December is also a busy time of year. People have holidays and a long break from school. They do not need to come to campus. Classes started again in late January. This might be why there were few log submissions that month. However, this does not explain why there were few submissions for February. Perhaps the project got less exciting after the start. We had a lot of energy at the beginning. We created a special project, Carpool Challenge Week, to get people excited again in March. This worked and led to more log submissions. We had a problem keeping people interested, even with semester breaks and holidays. \n\nAnother problem with the project is that people like driving their cars. This is part of our culture. We need to give people reasons to use other ways to travel. We gave prizes to people, like gift cards to local stores and restaurants. This helped. But it might have been better to give bigger prizes, like a new bicycle or a new car. This could have kept people interested in the project.\n\nThe prizes did not change for a long time. If we had given bigger prizes, it might have helped. The prizes we were giving were good at first, but bigger prizes might have kept people interested in the project.",
            "An ETF is a special kind of investment. It is like an index fund, but it is more flexible. It trades like a stock on a stock exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of many investments, like an index fund. It also gives you the freedom to sell short, buy more, and buy just one share at a time.\n\nETFs have some good things. They are not very expensive. They are also very flexible. You can trade them easily. They come in many kinds. You can choose the right one for you.\n\nBut ETFs also have some bad things. You have to pay a fee to trade them. This is like paying a fee to buy a stock. Some people think this is not good.\n\nWe will look at an ETF called IHF. We will compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to know if it is better to buy the ETF or just the top 10 stocks. We will look at the return, or money made, and the risk, or how much money you might lose.\n\nWe will look at the 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF. We will use this information to calculate the return and risk of a portfolio made up of just these 10 stocks. This will help us understand if the ETF is a good choice.\n\nOur results show that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings has a higher return, or more money made, than the ETF. It also has a lower risk, or less money lost. This could be a good choice for an investor.\n\nBut we need to be careful. We need to make sure our results are correct. We will look at the standard deviation, or how much the stock's value can change, of each of the top 10 stocks. This will help us understand if the difference between the ETF and the portfolio of top 10 stocks is real or just a mistake.",
            "Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Poe got this word from the famous writer Virgil. Virgil wrote about Thulé as an island north of Britain that the Greeks thought was the end of the world.\n\nBut there is another source that Poe might have used. Poe liked German writers. There is a writer named Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who wrote a poem called \"Faust\". Goethe wrote \"Faust\" in two parts, the first part in 1808 and the second part in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". This poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. The king then starts drinking a lot and crying because he misses his wife. He decides it is time to die and gives all his things to his children except the cup. Then he goes to a high place, throws the cup into the water, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe King of Thulé and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. Maybe they are like two dark friends who both lost someone they loved. \"Faust\" was also made into a play by a man named Henry P. Grattan in 1842. This play was published just before Poe used the word Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe wrote about Thulé twice in his writings. He used the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and the phrase \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\". \"Dream-Land\" starts and ends with the word Thulé. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a dark and lonely place. He sees dead friends and a world without color. These scenes are similar to \"The King of Thulé\" where the king has lost his wife and is lonely.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known. Poe said he liked another writer who liked Goethe, Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe would have read Goethe's work in many copies that were published after the original.",
            "California law says a customer who is hurt after falling on applesauce in a grocery store can ask for more money as punishment. This is because the store manager knew about the spill twice and did not clean it up for 30 minutes.\n\nA judge is not likely to throw out Jennifer Palmer's claim. To get more money as punishment, Palmer must show that the store manager acted on purpose to ignore the danger. She must also show that his actions were bad and meant to hurt people. \n\nPalmer can say the store manager knew that not cleaning the spill could cause harm. Many people had fallen in the store in the months before she fell. The manager still did not clean the spill. Palmer can argue that the manager's actions were very bad and meant to hurt people.\n\nThe manager, Paul Martin, was eating dinner when he was told about the spill. He said he did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Later, another employee told him about the spill again, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Palmer fell and hurt her back. Before she fell, five other people had fallen in the store that year.\n\nCalifornia law says a person can get more money as punishment if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice means the person acted on purpose to hurt someone, or they did something very bad and ignored the danger. The law says conduct is malicious when a person is aware of the danger and does not try to stop it.\n\nIn a previous case, a court said a person's actions were malicious when they ignored the danger and knew the consequences would be bad. The court said the person acted on purpose to ignore the danger.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One big question we discussed was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is even more important today.  In the years since 9/11, I have seen the media's view of Islam change from negative to very positive in America.  It is hard to imagine that a president with a Muslim family background could be elected in 2001.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad interests me.  What I know of Muhammad's history does not match his personality.  I used to think Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam.  He would conquer cities and make the people believe in Islam.  But the biography of Muhammad says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to believe in him because of his good character, not because he was powerful.\n\nI also see some strange similarities between the jobs of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food so there was enough for many people.  This kind of writing makes me think the writers want Muhammad to be seen as a kind and humble man who did not need to prove anything.  This is not fair because it takes away from the importance of Jesus' life and work.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that make it seem like the writers are trying to show how people became Muslims on their own.  But some of these stories come from people who heard from other people, not from the people who actually knew Muhammad.  I do not like this because it makes the stories seem less important.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this book is that it says Muhammad was a good and humble man.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if people today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's history is interesting.  Let's look at it.  After Jesus died, the teachings he spread were not used in the development of Christianity.  Instead, the religion moved forward in a different way.  If we look at the history of Christianity in broad strokes, we see a trend of moving away from its start.  Today, people are becoming more aware and looking for change.  Some people still follow traditional ideas, but they are not as many as those who want something new.  People who believe in Jesus' ideas will become more aware of the history of their faith in the future.  A yearning will grow to know the real ideas of Jesus and the religion he started.  It may take a long time, but this will happen.  In the future, there will be a change.  People will try to remove the things that were added to Christianity over time.  They will go back to what Jesus taught.  This will be a big change.  It will be like going back in time.  There will be a movement to get back to the ideas Jesus taught.  When this happens, the United States and Europe will be affected.  People will start to worship like Jesus taught.  The church will still be strong, but the way people think will be the same.  There will be less difference between different groups.  This is happening in history.  It happened before.  The Romans used to persecute Christians, but later they became Christian.  Our country used to be unfair to African-Americans, but now they are leaders.  Something like this will happen in the Christian religion.  It will go back to its start.  To make this happen, people will read Jesus' words in a new way.  They will not take them as facts, but as examples.\n\nJesus lived a long time ago.  Before him, only one main religion existed: Judaism.  It was the root of Christianity.  The Jews believed in one God and the authority of their scriptures.  When the Romans took control of Jerusalem in sixty-three B.C., the Jewish people were not all the same.  They were divided into groups like the Sadducees and Pharisees.",
            "The Jungle is a book that shows human beings are very selfish. They want to make their lives better without thinking about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories are a good example. They only care about making their factories bigger and more successful. They do not think about anything that gets in their way or hurts anyone.\n\nThe book's writer, Upton Sinclair, describes the factories in a way that shows the damage they cause. He says the factories are very dirty and make a lot of smoke. He wants the reader to see how bad the situation is. The owners do not care about people or animals that get hurt by their factories. They do not care about the dirty water from the factories or the animals that live in the area.\n\nThe owners also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, not help their workers. They make their workers work very hard and then fire them without warning. During the time the book is set, there were no laws to protect workers. So, the owners could do what they wanted. The workers had to work in bad conditions and live in poor conditions too. They were like slaves.\n\nThe workers had no help or information to make their lives better. Some groups were formed to help workers, but they often made money off the workers instead. The workers were very unhappy and had no way to escape the bad situation. The Jungle says it is like this because the owners are very cruel and unfair.",
            "Many authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald often pairs an adjective and a noun together in a way that is not usual. He uses this to give readers a feeling about a subject. He also gives meaning to a symbol and then uses it to remind readers of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for white and gray. He uses these colors to remind readers of a feeling about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald makes white and gray mean the same thing: all the same. White is better and more important. Gray is old and faded. He starts to use these colors in the beginning of the book. People always wear white: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white clothes, and Tom wears a white shirt. Even the streets are white: \"the white chasms of lower New York\".\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors to describe common things: the names of people are gray, a child is gray, and a man is gray. He does this to show that these things are not important.\n\nAfter building up meaning for white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to show that something is not important. He starts by describing Daisy in white clothes. Readers begin to see Daisy as not a person, but just something that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique again to show that Daisy is not important.\n\nFitzgerald also uses this technique with other colors, including gold, green, red, and pink. He builds up meaning for these colors and then uses them to remind readers of a feeling about important objects.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Farmers grow many kinds of food there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Many people in the area want to buy food from local farms that do not use chemicals. This is called organic food. There is a big market for this type of food in San Diego. Many people have to wait to buy it.\n\nFarmers who grow organic food often give tours of their farms. People can walk around, look at the plants and animals, and learn about farming. This can be a good way for farmers to make money. It can also help people understand how food is grown.\n\nGrowing organic food has some problems. It takes more work and time to remove pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without chemicals. It is also more expensive than growing food using chemicals. A small farm cannot produce as much food as a big farm. But organic farming helps the environment. It makes the area have more plants and animals. This is good for the land, the water, and the people who live there.\n\nThe land in this story is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land with different kinds of plants and trees. It is next to a forest. Many kinds of plants and animals live there. Some are in danger of disappearing. Others are getting less common.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. Before the farmers came, Native Americans lived there. Then, people raised cattle and cut down trees for wood. This land was used for farming for many years.\n\nI chose this land to study what a farmer might do to make farming less expensive and to help the plants and animals. I found an organic farm in the same area to use as an example.",
            "Culture is important in any talk. It is not easy to understand. A talk between people from different cultures can be difficult. To make a good agreement, it is helpful to understand a culture's values and ways. Culture is not the same for everyone. \n\nWhen we meet people from a different culture, we compare their ways to our own. We try to learn about their history and what they think is important. We do not try to change their ways. We accept them for what they are. This is especially true in talks where one side has more power.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies have their own culture too. For example, some companies work long hours. Others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its workers dress and talk. Some companies want their workers to help charities. Others do not.\n\nDifferent people within a culture have different ideas. This can be true even within the same company. Some people from other cultures may seem the same but are not. We should not just look at the surface. We need to look deeper.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is important. These values tell us why people act a certain way. If people value being polite, they will not argue in public. If people value getting a good deal, they will not give in easily. We should learn about our opponent's values before a talk. This will help us make a good agreement.",
            "People believe in a higher power. One Bible passage says: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is in the Christian Bible's Psalm 14. A man named St. Anselm wrote about God's existence. Another person, Thomas Aquinas, also wrote about God. Both men wanted to prove that God exists. They wrote their ideas in the same time period, so we will look at their ideas together.\n\nLet's assume both men are right about God. This is because we are trying to compare their ideas. If we think of a different kind of higher power, it will not be fair to compare their ideas. They wrote about the same God, the one in the Bible.\n\nWe will look at St. Anselm's idea first. He said people can find God inside themselves. He said we can see that God exists in our own minds. We don't need to look outside ourselves for proof. This idea is like faith. Faith means believing something without proof. Many Christian texts say that faith is important.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas had a different idea. He said we can prove God exists using reason and evidence. We don't need faith. This idea is good for telling people about God. It can help people join the Christian church. They can believe in God because of logic, not just because of faith. St. Thomas said there are five logical reasons to believe in God: change, cause and effect, things that exist but could not exist, levels of perfection, and order. He said we can understand God's existence by using these ideas. We can know about God without seeing him.",
            "A long time ago, around five hundred years before Christ, a prince was born. This prince would one day be called Buddha. He lived a long life and became enlightened. His teachings created Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is a very old religion. It is more than two thousand five hundred years old. It looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in the country of Sri Lanka. The people there observe a special ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony.\n\nMany people, both monks and laymen, take part in this ceremony. It has meaning, even though Buddha never taught about a celebration like this. The differences between Buddhism today and in Buddha's time are many. They can be seen in many things, from the small traditions to the main ideas of the religion.\n\nThe Buddhist community has had to change its main ideas over time. This has happened because of forces both from outside and inside the community. The community is made up of people who follow Buddha's teachings. Forces from outside the community are from people who do not believe in Buddhism.\n\nWe need to know some important words to understand what we are talking about. An internal force is a force that comes from people inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a force that comes from people outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is a force that hurts the community. A benign force is a force that does not hurt or help the community.\n\nWe will use these words a lot in this discussion. Now, let's talk about the main ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of three parts: the Tripitaka. This has many texts that explain Buddhism. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world. These ideas include no soul, suffering in life, and that everything is changing.\n\nBy understanding these ideas, people can stop the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. It happens over and over. Along with stopping Sansara, people can also stop desire, hatred, and delusion. These are the things that come from being not enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for how to live. For people who are not monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave improperly with someone of the opposite sex, and do not take drugs. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped.",
            "Two countries, the United States and Mexico, had a long rivalry. It lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry had a big fight, the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The United States won and took Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThe two countries had many other fights. They disagreed on issues like religion, culture, and tradition. They also disagreed on things they wanted like money and trade. This is like many other countries that have rivalries with their neighbors. \n\nWhen countries share a border, they often have disagreements. This can create problems between the countries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with long rivalries. They share a border and have had many disagreements.\n\nOne reason for the rivalry was a difference in religion. The United States and Mexico had different views on what was important. This was a big problem between the two countries. Many other countries have had disagreements over religion throughout history.\n\nA long time ago, the English and Spanish had a disagreement. This feeling of distrust was passed down to the United States and Mexico. This made it hard for the two countries to be friends.\n\nThere were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these fights were about territory and who controlled the land. There were also problems with people crossing the border and causing trouble.\n\nAs time went on, Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States' goals changed from wanting more land to wanting to help Mexico. This helped end the rivalry between the two countries.",
            "Fifteen years ago I became very sick. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job because I wanted a safe and secure life. I did not have a safe and secure life when I was a child. People said, \"You will always have a job. People will always get sick.\" So, I chose nursing. I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow I am 46 years old and I am not working. I do not have much money. I get a little money from the government, but it is not enough. I get by, but it is hard every day. I am not safe or secure anymore. But I know one thing: I could not have made it without my family and a few good friends. They helped me a lot. When bad things happen, it is hard to feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. We cannot prepare for everything. Some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nI agree that we should not put all our trust in the government. It is not strong. I think we should learn to trust each other again. We should help each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe people who want to be independent say that is how America was built. But it was not just independence that helped them. They had compassion, respect for each other, and shared their resources.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a kit with food, water, and other things I need in case of an emergency. I also have a first aid kit and a way to purify water. If you have a farm and can grow your own food, that is a good idea. But also get to know your neighbors and ask for help if you need it.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? Even a long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that scientists have not yet found a way to explain the simplest living things in a simple way. Today, scientists are using math to understand how living things grow and change. Recently, math was used to study how mollusks, a group of animals with shells, grow their shells. Our study is trying to use math to understand how living things change over time. We are using math to study how a type of mollusk called Prunum grows its shell.\n\nTo do this, we used pictures of Prunum shells to find numbers that we can use to model how the shell grows. We used a special computer program called CerioShell to create models of what the shell might look like. These models can help us understand how living things can change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It grows around a center point, and it has lines that separate each part of the shell. We can count how many parts there are and study how they grow. We can also study how the shell grows as the animal moves through time and space.\n\nWe can use math to show how the shell grows and change over time. This can help us understand how living things change and grow. We can use this information to create new ideas about how living things change over time.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that grows in a circle. The circle is divided into parts called whorls. Each whorl is like a ring that grows around the center of the shell. The center of the shell is called the columella. The whorls grow around the columella, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. The last whorl is the biggest, and the rest of the shell is called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways, such as from the top, bottom, or side. We can also count the whorls by drawing a line from the top and counting the parts. We can use math to show how the shell grows and changes over time.\n\nWe can study how the shell grows by tracing the path of the aperture. The aperture is the opening of the shell, and we can use math to show how it changes over time. This can help us understand how living things change and grow.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years.  Indonesia is making progress on some of the goals set for the year 2015, like providing clean water and sanitation.  But the country is not improving as quickly as it needs to on health for mothers and babies.  We will look at the reasons for this below.  They show that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger, not just improve specific programs.\n\nMore women in Indonesia are giving birth with a trained health worker.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  However, this number still includes traditional workers who cannot help if the birth is complicated.  Many mothers die because of bleeding after childbirth.  So, the progress in this area is not as good as it seems.  There are also fewer children with diarrhea who visit a health professional.  We do not have complete information on care for new mothers.  But it is clear that this is a problem.  Many areas of the country have low rates of care for new mothers.\n\nNot enough women in Indonesia have a C-section when they need one.  Only 4% of births are C-sections.  The percentage is higher in cities, 7%, but lower in rural areas, 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  This is a problem of fairness.  Another problem is that people who are poor have a harder time getting healthcare.  There is a 27% gap in who uses healthcare services between the richest and poorest people.  The poor cannot afford to pay out of their own money for healthcare.\n\nThe next question is how to make healthcare better for babies and mothers.  The main question is how to make sure there are enough healthcare services.  Should Indonesia develop special programs or make its healthcare system better?  It is clear that special programs can solve specific problems.  They have clear goals and can give quick results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  One problem is that if we spend a lot of money on one area, we may not have enough money for other areas.  Also, many programs can make it hard to coordinate services and give too much paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed stories about people of high social class in England during that time. But two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting. These elements help readers understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses strange and confusing ideas to show Oliver's feelings. For example: \"He was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were yelling. The words they said sounded in his ears. When he finally paid attention, he found he was talking to them.\" Oliver is very confused and scared. The strange visions make the reader understand how Oliver feels.\n\nThe strange events in Oliver Twist often happen in Oliver's dreams. These dreams show the reader what is wrong with Oliver and what he is feeling. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers the shooting of his friend. He relives the event in his mind, like a dream. Oliver is very scared and does not know what is happening. He is also very hurt and in a lot of pain.\n\nOliver has no control over what happens to him. He does not try to stop the bad things that happen. The shooting in the story shows that Oliver has no control over his life. He is influenced by the people around him, like the bad man Fagin. This makes Oliver feel defeated and without hope.\n\nWuthering Heights is another novel that uses strange and confusing events to make the characters more interesting. The author writes: \"The day passed quickly. There was no day – it was gone as soon as it started. The night was long and quiet, but it passed quickly.\"",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped Elementary age students with their studies. I was good at English and reading. The program's instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. He was having trouble reading. I helped him for a time, but I saw that something was not right. Some letters he read well, but others he did not understand. He spoke perfect English, but this was strange.\n\nI asked his mother for help. She did not speak English. I spoke a little Spanish, but not much. We tried to talk, but it was hard. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. I hope this helped him.\n\nI tell this story because there is a big problem in schools: the language barrier. This is a big problem in California. Even a child who speaks good English can have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what can we do? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading helped. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one answer. We need to use many approaches.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps children who speak Spanish, and all children. Children in bilingual programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit. How can we do this? We do not need all teachers to be bilingual. But we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",

Some people learn about it in Sunday school, others in Temple, and some find their own answers. Many people accept the ideas of their parents.

            "The Gothic Novel is a strange name for a story about old and new ideas. Ian Watt says it is like an \"oxymoron\" - two things that do not mix. People have criticized the Gothic mode for not being deep, and also praised it for its powerful and exciting parts. \n\nThe first Gothic Novel was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He used old ideas from \"ancient\" romances and new ideas from modern novels to create the Gothic style. He mixed old theatrical elements with new ways of writing to make a new kind of story. \n\nThe Gothic style uses many old ideas from medieval times, like old buildings and old traditions. Even when \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things, like old peoples and old styles. It was seen as old-fashioned compared to new ideas in society and literature.\n\nThe mix of old and new ideas is what makes the Gothic style interesting. It stays interesting for a long time, even if the reader is far from the time when it was written. \n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic stories is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It was important to Gothic writers because it represented a perfect knight who was brave, honorable, and good. They saw that society was not living up to this ideal, and they wanted to change it. \n\nThe idea of chivalry was used in \"The Castle of Otranto\" to make the past seem better than the present. This was a way of saying that society had lost something important. The writer, Horace Walpole, was writing during a difficult time in history. He was unhappy with the way society was going, and he wanted to make people think about what was important. \n\nOne character in the story, Frederic, is a good example of a chivalric knight. He is a prince who has been through hard times and is a good person. His description in the story includes many traditional ideas about chivalry, like being a gallant and courteous knight.",
            "Supply Chain Management\n------------------------\n\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order to the customer. It includes the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution. The term supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to provide good customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to understand what customers need. The market is a good guide to decide what customers demand. Managers decide what products to make and how many. They also choose where to make the products, considering customer demand and satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to plan workloads and maintenance. Production is a very important part. Every detail matters. If details are not planned correctly, it can cost a company time and money.\n\nSupply is the second key part of the supply chain. It includes making strategic decisions about a company's capabilities and partnerships. A company may have many divisions for a single product. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They may also outsource work to other companies to save time and money.\n\nInventory is the third key part. It includes storing and managing goods before they are sold. Location is the fourth part. It includes choosing the best place to make and store products. Transportation is the fifth part. It includes moving goods from one place to another. Information is the sixth part. It includes sharing information between companies and customers.\n\nManagers use these six parts to provide good customer service. They make sure the right products are made, stored, and delivered to customers on time. This helps a company be successful.",

She holds it up, and the message is written on it in black. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a group of military leaders who took power in 1962. They did not win power through an election.\n\nIn 2007, people on the street began to protest. This was the first time people had protested in ten years. The protests were led by monks. The monks wore yellow robes. After the first protests, more and more people joined in. The government was not happy. The government did not want people to protest.\n\nThe government allowed the monks to meet peacefully, but then the situation became violent. The military attacked the monks and their monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested. One journalist was killed while he was reporting on the protests.\n\nThis is not the only time that a government has tried to stop people from speaking out against it. Many governments throughout history have tried to stop people from protesting. In ancient Rome, the emperor thought they were chosen by the gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor is thought to be a god. In the United States, the president had meetings with a man who leads a group that is against freedom.\n\nThere are many examples of governments hurting their own people. In 1989, people in China protested against their government. The government did not like this, and many people were killed. In Rwanda, a group of people killed anyone who was not like them. Germany, under Hitler, killed many Jewish people.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Governments have been hurting their own people for a long time.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He lived a long life, which helped him create many new and important works of music for his orchestra. In many of his compositions, Ellington's piano playing is not very loud. However, as a composer, he was very good at making music that showed each member of the band. He created a framework for band members to play with freedom. Ellington also wrote music that was tightly organized and used the special style of each band member to show musical ideas. This created a new and original sound for each piece.\n\nEllington was very good at understanding how to make each band member sound good. He knew how to make the band sound good together as a group. This skill allowed him to write some of the most innovative and great music in jazz history.\n\nIn his music, Ellington often used the voice to add a new sound to his music. This is shown in his song \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, he used the voice as a musical instrument. It was one of the first times he did this in his career. The song is a slow, twelve-bar blues that has six parts. Each part is different.\n\nPart 1: The song starts with a call and response between the voice and the reeds. The voice starts with a smooth sound and then becomes rougher at the end.\nPart 2: A muted trumpet player plays a solo. The solo makes the melody more interesting and uses many blue notes.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast, high solo while the piano plays a subtle rhythm.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nPart 5: The reeds start the call and response in a high voice. The brass and rhythm sections play a strong, rhythmic pattern.\nPart 6: The song returns to the first part, with a call and response between the voice and the reeds. In this part, the voice sounds like a musical instrument.\n\nIn another song, \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington uses his skill at making tight music with his band. He also uses his ear to make new and interesting sounds. In this song, a trumpet player and a singer use their voices to create a rich sound.\n\nIn \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington uses a trombone player to make the melody sound new and interesting.",

Some boys liked her, but she did not like them. She often thought about what could be causing this.

            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" affects the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study found that eating a diet high in plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and low in animal products and saturated fats, can reduce this risk.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that eating a Mediterranean-style diet can help people live longer and prevent heart disease. However, this study focused on the connection between the diet and stroke.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women were part of a larger study of nurses in 11 US states. The researchers asked the women about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. They found that women who ate a Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nTo make sure the results were accurate, the researchers looked at medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates to confirm cases of heart disease and stroke. They also accounted for other factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. In fact, women who ate the most Mediterranean-style foods were 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke than those who ate the least.\n\nThis study shows that eating a Mediterranean-style diet can be an effective way to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. This diet is not only good for the heart, but it may also help people live longer and healthier lives.",
            "The United States had a big financial crisis in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and some big companies were in trouble. This problem is still a problem today. So, we must ask: how did this problem happen and how can we stop it? The financial crisis happened because of bad and foolish decisions made by politicians. They pushed banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks and companies then sold these loans to other places, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These companies mixed the loans together and sold them to others. When the people who borrowed the money could not pay, the banks and companies were in trouble. \n\nThis problem began in 1999. President Clinton wanted a second term in office. He wanted to be popular. So, he made it easier for banks to give loans to people who could not afford them. A reporter at the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to give loans to people who earn little money. The company wanted to grow and make more money.\" The reporter said this could cause big problems if the economy slowed down. And it did. \n\nSome new kinds of loans were used to buy homes. These loans had rates that could change, and they were complicated. They were mixed together and sold to many people. This made many people borrow too much money. When the housing market fell, they could not pay back the money. The big banks and companies that bought these loans were in trouble. They lost $4.1 trillion dollars in 2007. This is a big number. It is one-third of the country's total money. Some companies were sold, and some were forced to change the way they work.

It's like a guest that you don't want to invite to your party.\n\nWe already know the rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes.  She writes a lot of words that tell the reader what happened.  And it makes the reader bored.\n\nExposition is when you tell the reader about the story.  It's like a character telling another character a lot of information.  But your readers don't want to hear it.  They want to see it.\n\nLet's look at an example.  You read a story and you learn that a woman met her husband a long time ago.  They got married in a big ceremony.  And then he died in front of her.  But you don't want to read about all of it happening in a few lines.  You want to see the husband's character.  You want to see how much he loved her.  And you want to see how much she loved him.\n\nIf the story tells you that she was happy with him, you want to see it in her words and actions.  You want to see her smile when she thinks of him.  You want to see her cry when she remembers him.  That way, you can feel her sadness.  And you can feel her love for him.\n\nSo, as a writer, you need to give the reader more.  You need to show, not tell.  Don't make your readers fall asleep or click the \"Back\" button.  Give them meat on the bone.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live this morning (August 13, 2011) on NBC 4. The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler. He stabbed his wife many times in Ashley, Ohio. He was arrested. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news was only two minutes long. I think it was enough time.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically hurt. Police did not have any suspects. A special police team was working on the case. I thought this story was short. I think it was because the man who was shot was black and from a black neighborhood. I have noticed that the news does not give as much attention to minorities who are victims of crimes. If a white person is a victim, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a gun hole in a helicopter. It was a .22 caliber bullet that hit the helicopter. Police want people to tell them who did it. They will give a reward of five thousand dollars to anyone who helps.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid to low eighties. The news did not talk about this for very long.\n\nThey also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man robbed the store. He wore a black sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought the news talked about this man being black a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug seller in Texas. He was in a group that sold marijuana in Ohio from Texas. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison. The news also said he was Hispanic. I did not think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special friendship between brothers. It is a strong and unbreakable bond. This friendship has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. They see themselves in each other. In hard times, this bond is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they make a big difference. Part of understanding brotherly love is dealing with the problems it causes. When you look at your brother, you see yourself. You see the good and the bad. Your actions and what happens because of them show who you really are. The story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this. Two brothers go on a difficult journey. They have many strong feelings. In the end, one brother survives, but the other does not. The story shows how one of the brothers feels proud and resentful towards his brother. The brother wants a brother he can play with and teach things to. But his brother is very sick and cannot do these things. The brother is very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels happy and loving. This shows that he cares about his brother. This is a complex feeling that shows the love and anger of brotherhood.\n\nThe main character's actions are driven by one main feeling: pride. He wants a brother who can play with him and learn from him. He wants a brother who can run and climb with him. But his brother is very sick and cannot do these things. The brother is very sad and angry that his brother cannot be the brother he wants. This is shown when he thinks about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels happy and loving. This shows that he cares about his brother and loves him.",
            "The human brain is a very complicated system. It helps us think and learn. As technology has improved, people have used different ideas to explain how the brain works. They compared it to a tablet made of wax, then to a piece of paper, and now to a computer. These ideas are useful, but they have limits. They can also lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. These are like special helpers that turn what we see, hear, touch, and taste into signals. The brain uses these signals to make decisions. It does this in two parts: bottom-up and top-down. \n\nImagine you see a picture of a black box on a white background. The bottom-up process looks at the picture and says, \"I see some black and white colors, and some lines that mean this is a box.\" The top-down process uses this information to say, \"I know this is a box, not a hole in the white background.\" \n\nWhen the brain gets information, it decides how important it is. This helps choose what we pay attention to. For example, we might see many blades of grass, but we only notice a few. We might also hear our name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information in three types: sensory, working, and long-term. We get sensory information from our senses. Working memory stores information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Long-term memory keeps information for a long time. Scientists think that working memory is like a short signal that goes through some brain cells. Long-term memory is like a special kind of protein that keeps the information.\n\nThere are many theories about how we organize our knowledge in the brain. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some come from computer science, and some come from studying the brain. One idea is that our brain has small places that connect to each other. These places are like concepts, and they connect to each other because they are related. For example, our brain might connect the idea of a \"chair\" to the idea of a \"table,\" which is connected to the idea of \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "The writer Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of new technology and the way it is supported by the system of capitalism. In his novel Brave New World, he pictures a bad future where people value groups over individuals and seek happiness right away. People are taught from a young age to choose pleasure above all else. The citizens are shown to be controlled by a single system, ruled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. \n\nIf we look at the book through the ideas of Marxism, we can see that the writer is warning us about the problems of the economy of his time. Huxley uses special words from Marxism, such as the idea of equality for everyone being the same, and how people are controlled by the rules of society.\n\nHuxley makes fun of capitalism in the book by showing how the common people are not aware of their relationship with the more powerful people in society. They are only interested in getting richer and more things. This is because the system is designed to keep them from knowing the truth. The people in the book, like the Delta and Gamma classes, do not have their own ideas. They are forced to follow the rules and buy things they do not need.\n\nThe wealthy people in the book are in control and do nothing to change the system. The interactions between the different people in the book show that they are very unkind to each other. They do not really know each other, and they do not care about each other's feelings. The writer may be saying that the rise of new technology and capitalism takes away people's freedom and ability to express themselves.\n\nThe people in the book do not have real love or deep feelings. They are only interested in looking good and having fun. The way the people in the different classes accept their place in society shows how the system of capitalism affects people's lives. They are happy to obey the rules and stay in line with what is expected of them.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. It can be hard for students to get around campus. My first year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls. It is far from many buildings, including the Willard building. It takes me 25 minutes to walk from my home to classes in Willard when the weather is bad. I talked to an older student and learned that the East Halls were once separated from the rest of the school by empty land. Now, that space has buildings, sports fields and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to get from one place to another. A good solution is the bicycle. But students must ride them and the campus needs to help.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Bicycles are good for your body. They are also the fastest way to travel. A simple breakfast and some exercise will take you 30 miles or more. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. The smartest thing I did was buy a bike. I ride to Thomas building for class. It takes me 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The problem is, Pollock Road is not an easy road to ride on.\n\nThere are good things about walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That is two and a half hours every week. I don't have time for that."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper looks at the Biological and Sociocultural models of a sleep problem called insomnia. Insomnia is a sleep disorder. There are two main ways to look at this problem: the Biological model and the Sociocultural model. The Biological model looks at genetics and health. The Sociocultural model looks at how the environment and things like race, ethnicity, and income affect sleep.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by many things, including other mental health problems, medical conditions, or substances. There are many types of sleep problems. Some are called Dyssomnias, which are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep. Others are called Parasomnias, which are problems with strange behaviors during sleep.\n\nDyssomnias include insomnia, which is a problem falling asleep or staying asleep. Hypersomnia is a problem staying awake. Narcolepsy is a problem with staying awake and alert. Breathing-related sleep disorder and circadian rhythm sleep disorder are other types of Dyssomnias. The biological model says that genetics and health can cause these problems.\n\nOne study looked at mice to understand how genes affect sleep. The study found that certain receptors in the brain help control sleep and wakefulness. These receptors can be affected by genetics, which can cause sleep problems. This study shows that genetics can affect sleep, which is good to know for people with insomnia.\n\nThe Sociocultural model looks at how the environment and society affect sleep. For example, people from different cultures or with different incomes may have different sleep patterns. A study found that certain genetic receptors in the brain can be affected by genetics, which can cause sleep problems. This means that people with certain genetic traits may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThis study is important because it shows that genetics can affect sleep. If people have a genetic problem that affects sleep, it can make it hard for them to focus and do daily tasks. This can affect their lives in many ways.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). We will explain what CAPD is, how it is diagnosed, and ways a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nCAPD is a disorder of the brain. It means the brain has trouble understanding what we hear. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain does not work correctly to understand them. This is not the same as being deaf. A person with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain has trouble separating different sounds or understanding what is being said.\n\nThe idea of CAPD was first discovered in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. They developed tests to help diagnose the problem. In 1954, Italian researchers started testing children. They found that the brain has trouble with certain sounds and voices.\n\nCAPD can affect people in different ways. They may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may not be able to tell the difference between two sounds at the same time. They may not understand patterns of sound or changes in voice. They may also have trouble understanding what someone is saying.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors and specialists use tests. They observe how a person listens and responds to sounds. They may use special tools to measure how the brain works. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nA teacher can help a student with CAPD in several ways. The teacher can use visual aids, such as pictures or videos, to help the student understand what is being said. The teacher can also use simple language and repeat instructions. They can give the student extra time to understand what is being said. The teacher can also provide a quiet space for the student to work and listen.",
            "Twelfth Night is a play that says hiding the truth can be useful in many cases. But in the end, a person must decide whether to reveal the truth or keep hiding. If they tell the truth, they may lose relationships with others. If they keep hiding, they may lose themselves.\n\nThe play also talks about people hiding their true selves by pretending to be the opposite sex. This is a big problem because it makes people ask why they do this. Why do they want to hide who they are? In the play, a character named Viola pretends to be a man to protect herself from harm. She is good at pretending and people believe she is a man. But she loses her friends and has to deal with love feelings from two people - one man and one woman.\n\nThe play shows how hiding the truth can help people find their feelings. Viola's pretending helps one man find love with her, but it also makes things complicated. The man, Orsino, had feelings for Viola when she was pretending to be a man. Now he is confused. The woman, Olivia, loves Viola when she thinks she is a man, but when she finds out, she loves Viola's twin brother, Sebastian.\n\nThe play makes people think about why people hide who they are. Is Olivia really in love with women, or does she just look at people's appearance? The play says it is not easy to know what people really feel. Olivia easily changes her feelings from one person to another. She loves Viola when she thinks Viola is a man, but when she finds out she is a woman, Olivia loves Viola's twin brother.",
            "The German empire in Africa was known for its harsh treatment of local people. One example is the Ovaherero and Nama groups in German South West Africa. However, this is not a complete picture of the German empire. The way Germany ruled its colonies varied a lot. Even the way it provided education was different in each place. \n\nIn 1919, Britain took control of German East Africa (now called Tanganyika). They found many Africans who were well-educated and could read and write. Germany's education efforts in other colonies, like Kamerun, were also praised by people who lived at the time. \n\nBut South West Africa (now Namibia) was a different story. The government in East Africa built schools for local people and gave them a big role in education. In South West Africa, the job of educating the local people was left to missionary groups who got little help from the government. The government did invest in education for European people in the colony. They built schools and controlled missionary schools. \n\nThe government's choices had a lasting effect on South West Africa. Many other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans. But in South West Africa, most people remained uneducated and unable to read. Many things caused the difference between South West Africa and other colonies. This paper will look at these things and what happened in South West Africa, especially what settlers and government officials thought about the local people.\n\nThere is a lot written about education in the German empire. Much of this writing is in German and was done a long time ago. The early writing mostly described how education was done in the different colonies. Later writing in English compared education in different colonies and looked at specific parts of education in more detail. These studies showed that each colony had a different education system. One of the most important studies is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the many European settlers in South West Africa explained many of the differences in the colony's education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a warm climate, but much of the land is desert. This is why there were a lot of European settlers in South West Africa. By 1913, about 15,000 Europeans lived there. Only about 5,300 Europeans lived in the colony with the next largest number of settlers, East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music is a popular music style that has grown very much over the last 100 years. Many people think it is very difficult to list all the different kinds of heavy metal music. It is even harder because many of these kinds of music have smaller groups within them. One of the most interesting kinds of heavy metal music is called heavy metal rock. It has many different emotions, mostly dark and unhappy ones. It is also very different because people started to make their own kinds of heavy metal music a long time ago. This led to smaller groups of music, and this chain of smaller groups continues today.\n\nToday, heavy metal music is very hard to understand because it has many different kinds of music in it. But to understand it, we must first know what heavy metal music is and why it is a special kind of music.\n\nHeavy metal music is a kind of music that is often about the darker side of life. It is music with more sound, more volume, and more energy. People who play heavy metal music are very good at playing their instruments, and you can hear this in their music. Heavy metal music also has a connection to drugs. Many people used drugs to create some of the first heavy metal music in the 1970s. This music had many strange and unusual qualities that were new to the music world. Later, other kinds of heavy metal music took some of these qualities from other kinds of music, like the Romantic Era. Some examples of heavy metal music show how dark and unhappy it can be:\n\nThese words from the song Helter Skelter show the darker side of music. They talk about the ups and downs of life, and some people think this song was one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to a song by the Rolling Stones that was also very heavy and dark. The Beatles wanted to show that they could make music just as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau: A Dream of Acceptance\n\nHenri Rousseau painted a very special picture called \"The Dream\" in 1910. This painting shows a woman looking at wonderful things in a dream. But it also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals as an artist. He wanted other artists and people who love art to accept and praise him. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he also wanted to be himself and paint in his own way.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know a little about his life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a hardware seller. Rousseau did not go to school to learn about art. Instead, he worked for many years for the government. He became a toll collector and was known as a customs officer.\n\nRousseau's life was very sad. His wife and many of their children died. He was left with only one child, a daughter named Julia. He started painting to help him feel better and to start a new life. Rousseau was not like other artists who painted beautiful and romantic pictures of peasants. He was a folk painter who painted about the things people in his class thought about.\n\nRousseau wanted the art world to accept him. He started painting late in life and was working at the same time as many other famous artists. It was hard for him to get recognition. It was not until around the same time that another artist, Matisse, became famous that Rousseau started to get the recognition he wanted. A writer named Jan Gordon said that Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to be a good painter and not paint in a boring way. Rousseau just wanted to paint in a way that would make people accept him as an artist.",
            "Many great thinkers believe that ethics and aesthetics are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same. I agree with this idea. As the great poet John Keats once said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn about many things in life through education or experience. But we seem to understand ethics and aesthetics in a different way. We try to explain what is good or beautiful, not make rules for art or behavior.\n\nWhen we talk about art or morals, we can't fully describe what makes something good or beautiful. For example, we can talk about the colors, shapes, and context of a painting like the Mona Lisa. But these things don't explain why it's a great work of art. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say, \"There's something about it\" that they can't explain.\n\nI believe that both art and morals have a special quality that can't be fully described. As the writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way. . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" We can describe art and morals, but there's always something more.\n\nI think that this is why ethics and aesthetics are connected. We experience both of them in a deep way that can't be fully explained. This is especially true for literature. Literature has a special ability to teach us about values and morals. As the writer McKean said, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. It's as important to our lives as our values themselves.\"",
            "Germany is a strong country with its own culture. This culture comes from many different groups of people. You can feel it in the great cities of Germany, from München near the Alps to the city of Kiel near the Baltic Sea.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many different tribes lived in this area. They came from many places. The name 'Germany' comes from these tribes. But its meaning is not clear.\n\nThe Roman writer Tacitus said the name came from a group of people called the Tungrians. They were also called Germans before they crossed the Rhine River and fought the Gauls. The Roman leader Julius Caesar used the word 'Germanus' in his writings about the wars he fought against the Gauls. Caesar got the word from the Gauls themselves. He used it to talk about the people he had not yet defeated.\n\nSome people think the name 'Germany' comes from a spear used by the Germans in war. Others think it comes from the Old Irish word 'garim', which means 'to shout'. This may mean the Germans were loud.\n\nThe Roman writer Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum'. He said the Germans were the first people to live in the area. They did not come from other places. They were not mixed with other groups of people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany. They sent soldiers to the area to get goods and to fight. But they mostly stayed in their own country. The Germanic tribes lived on the edge of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and skills with the Romans.",
            "I looked down at the picture before me.  My mind was empty.  I was not feeling any strong feelings.  I was simply looking at the view.  My brain was working quickly.  It was taking in the picture and then moving on.  I did not have strong thoughts about what I was seeing.  I was just observing.\n\nI once bought a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  An artist told me to buy it.  It teaches people how to draw.  One thing it says is to draw a square around a picture.  This makes it easier to understand.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit.  But I could not imagine a square around it.  I was too busy looking at all the details.  I was amazed.\n\nMany famous artists, like Picasso and Monet, have their own ways of seeing the world.  I wanted to be an artist too.  I wanted to create something special.  I wanted to make a good picture.\n\nMy hand reached for a pencil.  I was ready to start drawing.  But then I thought about something else.  My hand went to the toilet handle.  I had to move something that was stuck.\n\nI grabbed a mop and a piece of toilet paper.  I put the mop on the floor and stood up straight.  Then I bent down and put my hand into the toilet.  It was not easy.  But I did it.",
            "Teenagers are dying in car accidents. Many things cause this problem. One reason is that the teen brain is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teens also do not have much experience driving. This lack of experience causes more accidents and increases the number of rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nWhen teens drive with their friends, the risk of an accident is even higher. A study in Southern California found a connection between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states are trying to make driving safer for teens. They require special temporary licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and do not allow other minors as passengers. But these special licenses are just temporary solutions. The real problem is that teens, as a group, are not able to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.\n\nA psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young to have a regular driver's license. He found that people under 20 years old often want to take risks for the fun of it. This makes sense. We should delay giving driver's licenses to young teens until this desire for risk-taking goes away. If we continue to give licenses to young teens, we will see many more accidents and the number of deaths will be very high. \n\nIn a few years, many more teens will be able to drive. By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road. We need laws to protect them. Schools can teach driver's education, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. A special permit could still be given before a regular license, and teens would still need to practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours could be the same as in most states. For example, in California, teens need 6 hours of driving with an adult and 50 hours of practice. National laws to protect teens would be a good way to make sure all teens are safe.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a good way to protect teens.",
            "I looked through the films at the Library of Congress. I decided to watch all the trick films. There were fifteen of them from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to create illusions. My study of film looked at how these films work and why some of them are different from others.\n\nMost trick films at the time were made in a special setting. The camera did not move. It stayed in one place. The films used long shots and some medium shots. They did not use close-up shots. This is because of the way the films were made. The actors did not move towards or away from the camera. They only moved side to side.\n\nOne film, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel, shows actors entering from one side and moving back and forth. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame. This is because the films were made like plays. The actors did not move up or down. They only moved side to side.\n\nMost tricks were short and simple. They were like magic tricks. They showed things disappearing or changing quickly. Some films were a little longer. But most were only a minute or less. They did not tell a story. They just showed a trick.\n\nBut some film makers tried something new. They joined two or more shots together to create an illusion. For example, a film of a person being beheaded is actually two shots. One shot shows the person being beheaded and another shot shows the head being removed. The viewer sees only one shot, but there are two physical shots.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of Republicanism. He was a farmer and had a short time in politics. This made him known for his strong opinions about freedom and the government. He thought farming was the best job. He used this idea to influence his thoughts about the government. He wanted to keep and grow a good system of farming.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a chance to make a perfect system of government. There was no old tradition to follow. This made it easy to create a new way of governing. He believed that all people are equal and that if one person is not free, none are. He thought the government should not control people's rights. He said that in nature, strong people take control. But in a civilization, this should not happen.\n\nTaylor wanted to make a government that knows people have good and bad inside. He thought a government should help people be good. He believed good principles are those that protect property, help farming, and stop people from being too rich. He thought a good government would work well, no matter who is in charge. He believed people are always acting in their own best interest. But if they only think of themselves, it is bad. He wanted a government to control people's bad behavior and keep them from hurting others.\n\nTaylor wanted a small federal government. It should only have the powers the Constitution says it has. He thought a big government is expensive and could be unfair. But he also thought a simple, direct reading of the Constitution could be wrong. He believed we should understand the ideas of the people who wrote it.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence is the true rule of the United States. It says the country is made up of many states, not one country. This is more clear than the Constitution.",
            "Look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in the number of people submitting their commuter logs in the third month of the project. This was a little disappointing. It is hard to know why this happened. Winter had just started at our school. Fewer people were walking or biking because of the cold weather. Many students were busy with schoolwork and preparing for grades. They may have forgotten to fill out the logs. The month of December is also a busy time of year. People have holidays and a long break from school. They do not need to come to campus. Classes started again in late January. This might be why there were few log submissions that month. However, this does not explain why there were few submissions for February. Perhaps the project got less exciting after the start. We had a lot of energy at the beginning. We created a special project, Carpool Challenge Week, to get people excited again in March. This worked and led to more log submissions. We had a problem keeping people interested, even with semester breaks and holidays. \n\nAnother problem with the project is that people like driving their cars. This is part of our culture. We need to give people reasons to use other ways to travel. We gave prizes to people, like gift cards to local stores and restaurants. This helped. But it might have been better to give bigger prizes, like a new bicycle or a new car. This could have kept people interested in the project.\n\nThe prizes did not change for a long time. If we had given bigger prizes, it might have helped. The prizes we were giving were good at first, but bigger prizes might have kept people interested in the project.",
            "An ETF is a special kind of investment. It is like an index fund, but it is more flexible. It trades like a stock on a stock exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of many investments, like an index fund. It also gives you the freedom to sell short, buy more, and buy just one share at a time.\n\nETFs have some good things. They are not very expensive. They are also very flexible. You can trade them easily. They come in many kinds. You can choose the right one for you.\n\nBut ETFs also have some bad things. You have to pay a fee to trade them. This is like paying a fee to buy a stock. Some people think this is not good.\n\nWe will look at an ETF called IHF. We will compare it to its top 10 holdings. We want to know if it is better to buy the ETF or just the top 10 stocks. We will look at the return, or money made, and the risk, or how much money you might lose.\n\nWe will look at the 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF. We will use this information to calculate the return and risk of a portfolio made up of just these 10 stocks. This will help us understand if the ETF is a good choice.\n\nOur results show that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings has a higher return, or more money made, than the ETF. It also has a lower risk, or less money lost. This could be a good choice for an investor.\n\nBut we need to be careful. We need to make sure our results are correct. We will look at the standard deviation, or how much the stock's value can change, of each of the top 10 stocks. This will help us understand if the difference between the ETF and the portfolio of top 10 stocks is real or just a mistake.",
            "Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is one of his best works. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Poe got this word from the famous writer Virgil. Virgil wrote about Thulé as an island north of Britain that the Greeks thought was the end of the world.\n\nBut there is another source that Poe might have used. Poe liked German writers. There is a writer named Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who wrote a poem called \"Faust\". Goethe wrote \"Faust\" in two parts, the first part in 1808 and the second part in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". This poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. The king then starts drinking a lot and crying because he misses his wife. He decides it is time to die and gives all his things to his children except the cup. Then he goes to a high place, throws the cup into the water, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe King of Thulé and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. Maybe they are like two dark friends who both lost someone they loved. \"Faust\" was also made into a play by a man named Henry P. Grattan in 1842. This play was published just before Poe used the word Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe wrote about Thulé twice in his writings. He used the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and the phrase \"Thulé\" in \"Dream-Land\". \"Dream-Land\" starts and ends with the word Thulé. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a dark and lonely place. He sees dead friends and a world without color. These scenes are similar to \"The King of Thulé\" where the king has lost his wife and is lonely.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known. Poe said he liked another writer who liked Goethe, Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe would have read Goethe's work in many copies that were published after the original.",
            "California law says a customer who is hurt after falling on applesauce in a grocery store can ask for more money as punishment. This is because the store manager knew about the spill twice and did not clean it up for 30 minutes.\n\nA judge is not likely to throw out Jennifer Palmer's claim. To get more money as punishment, Palmer must show that the store manager acted on purpose to ignore the danger. She must also show that his actions were bad and meant to hurt people. \n\nPalmer can say the store manager knew that not cleaning the spill could cause harm. Many people had fallen in the store in the months before she fell. The manager still did not clean the spill. Palmer can argue that the manager's actions were very bad and meant to hurt people.\n\nThe manager, Paul Martin, was eating dinner when he was told about the spill. He said he did not have time to deal with customer complaints. Later, another employee told him about the spill again, but he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Palmer fell and hurt her back. Before she fell, five other people had fallen in the store that year.\n\nCalifornia law says a person can get more money as punishment if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Malice means the person acted on purpose to hurt someone, or they did something very bad and ignored the danger. The law says conduct is malicious when a person is aware of the danger and does not try to stop it.\n\nIn a previous case, a court said a person's actions were malicious when they ignored the danger and knew the consequences would be bad.

            "I took a class in Islam at CBC almost four years ago.  One big question we discussed was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is even more important today.  In the years since 9/11, I have seen the media's view of Islam change from negative to very positive in America.  It is hard to imagine that a president with a Muslim family background could be elected in 2001.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad interests me.  What I know of Muhammad's history does not match his personality.  I used to think Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam.  He would conquer cities and make the people believe in Islam.  But the biography of Muhammad says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to believe in him because of his good character, not because he was powerful.\n\nI also see some strange similarities between the jobs of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food so there was enough for many people.  This kind of writing makes me think the writers want Muhammad to be seen as a kind and humble man who did not need to prove anything.  This is not fair because it takes away from the importance of Jesus' life and work.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that make it seem like the writers are trying to show how people became Muslims on their own.  But some of these stories come from people who heard from other people, not from the people who actually knew Muhammad.  I do not like this because it makes the stories seem less important.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this book is that it says Muhammad was a good and humble man.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if people today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's history is interesting.  Let's look at it.  After Jesus died, the teachings he spread were not used in the development of Christianity.  Instead, the religion moved forward in a different way.  If we look at the history of Christianity in broad strokes, we see a trend of moving away from its start.  Today, people are becoming more aware and looking for change.  Some people still follow traditional ideas, but they are not as many as those who want something new.  People who believe in Jesus' ideas will become more aware of the history of their faith in the future.  A yearning will grow to know the real ideas of Jesus and the religion he started.  It may take a long time, but this will happen.  In the future, there will be a change.  People will try to remove the things that were added to Christianity over time.  They will go back to what Jesus taught.  This will be a big change.  It will be like going back in time.  There will be a movement to get back to the ideas Jesus taught.  When this happens, the United States and Europe will be affected.  People will start to worship like Jesus taught.  The church will still be strong, but the way people think will be the same.  There will be less difference between different groups.  This is happening in history.  It happened before.  The Romans used to persecute Christians, but later they became Christian.  Our country used to be unfair to African-Americans, but now they are leaders.  Something like this will happen in the Christian religion.  It will go back to its start.  To make this happen, people will read Jesus' words in a new way.  They will not take them as facts, but as examples.\n\nJesus lived a long time ago.  Before him, only one main religion existed: Judaism.  It was the root of Christianity.  The Jews believed in one God and the authority of their scriptures.  When the Romans took control of Jerusalem in sixty-three B.C., the Jewish people were not all the same.  They were divided into groups like the Sadducees and Pharisees.",
            "The Jungle is a book that shows human beings are very selfish. They want to make their lives better without thinking about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories are a good example. They only care about making their factories bigger and more successful. They do not think about anything that gets in their way or hurts anyone.\n\nThe book's writer, Upton Sinclair, describes the factories in a way that shows the damage they cause. He says the factories are very dirty and make a lot of smoke. He wants the reader to see how bad the situation is. The owners do not care about people or animals that get hurt by their factories. They do not care about the dirty water from the factories or the animals that live in the area.\n\nThe owners also do not care about their workers. They want to make money, not help their workers. They make their workers work very hard and then fire them without warning. During the time the book is set, there were no laws to protect workers. So, the owners could do what they wanted. The workers had to work in bad conditions and live in poor conditions too. They were like slaves.\n\nThe workers had no help or information to make their lives better. Some groups were formed to help workers, but they often made money off the workers instead. The workers were very unhappy and had no way to escape the bad situation. The Jungle says it is like this because the owners are very cruel and unfair.",
            "Many authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald often pairs an adjective and a noun together in a way that is not usual. He uses this to give readers a feeling about a subject. He also gives meaning to a symbol and then uses it to remind readers of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for white and gray. He uses these colors to remind readers of a feeling about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald makes white and gray mean the same thing: all the same. White is better and more important. Gray is old and faded. He starts to use these colors in the beginning of the book. People always wear white: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white clothes, and Tom wears a white shirt. Even the streets are white: \"the white chasms of lower New York\".\n\nFitzgerald also uses these colors to describe common things: the names of people are gray, a child is gray, and a man is gray. He does this to show that these things are not important.\n\nAfter building up meaning for white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to show that something is not important. He starts by describing Daisy in white clothes. Readers begin to see Daisy as not a person, but just something that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique again to show that Daisy is not important.\n\nFitzgerald also uses this technique with other colors, including gold, green, red, and pink. He builds up meaning for these colors and then uses them to remind readers of a feeling about important objects.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Farmers grow many kinds of food there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Many people in the area want to buy food from local farms that do not use chemicals. This is called organic food. There is a big market for this type of food in San Diego. Many people have to wait to buy it.\n\nFarmers who grow organic food often give tours of their farms. People can walk around, look at the plants and animals, and learn about farming. This can be a good way for farmers to make money. It can also help people understand how food is grown.\n\nGrowing organic food has some problems. It takes more work and time to remove pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without chemicals. It is also more expensive than growing food using chemicals. A small farm cannot produce as much food as a big farm. But organic farming helps the environment. It makes the area have more plants and animals. This is good for the land, the water, and the people who live there.\n\nThe land in this story is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land with different kinds of plants and trees. It is next to a forest. Many kinds of plants and animals live there. Some are in danger of disappearing. Others are getting less common.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. Before the farmers came, Native Americans lived there. Then, people raised cattle and cut down trees for wood. This land was used for farming for many years.\n\nI chose this land to study what a farmer might do to make farming less expensive and to help the plants and animals.

To make a good agreement, it is helpful to understand a culture's values and ways. Culture is not the same for everyone. \n\nWhen we meet people from a different culture, we compare their ways to our own. We try to learn about their history and what they think is important. We do not try to change their ways. We accept them for what they are. This is especially true in talks where one side has more power.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies have their own culture too. For example, some companies work long hours. Others have a more relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in how its workers dress and talk. Some companies want their workers to help charities. Others do not.\n\nDifferent people within a culture have different ideas. This can be true even within the same company. Some people from other cultures may seem the same but are not. We should not just look at the surface. We need to look deeper.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is important. These values tell us why people act a certain way. If people value being polite, they will not argue in public. If people value getting a good deal, they will not give in easily. We should learn about our opponent's values before a talk. This will help us make a good agreement.",
            "People believe in a higher power. One Bible passage says: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This is in the Christian Bible's Psalm 14. A man named St. Anselm wrote about God's existence. Another person, Thomas Aquinas, also wrote about God. Both men wanted to prove that God exists. They wrote their ideas in the same time period, so we will look at their ideas together.\n\nLet's assume both men are right about God. This is because we are trying to compare their ideas. If we think of a different kind of higher power, it will not be fair to compare their ideas. They wrote about the same God, the one in the Bible.\n\nWe will look at St. Anselm's idea first. He said people can find God inside themselves. He said we can see that God exists in our own minds. We don't need to look outside ourselves for proof. This idea is like faith. Faith means believing something without proof. Many Christian texts say that faith is important.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas had a different idea. He said we can prove God exists using reason and evidence. We don't need faith. This idea is good for telling people about God. It can help people join the Christian church. They can believe in God because of logic, not just because of faith. St. Thomas said there are five logical reasons to believe in God: change, cause and effect, things that exist but could not exist, levels of perfection, and order. He said we can understand God's existence by using these ideas. We can know about God without seeing him.",
            "A long time ago, around five hundred years before Christ, a prince was born. This prince would one day be called Buddha. He lived a long life and became enlightened. His teachings created Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is a very old religion. It is more than two thousand five hundred years old. It looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen in the country of Sri Lanka. The people there observe a special ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony.\n\nMany people, both monks and laymen, take part in this ceremony. It has meaning, even though Buddha never taught about a celebration like this. The differences between Buddhism today and in Buddha's time are many. They can be seen in many things, from the small traditions to the main ideas of the religion.\n\nThe Buddhist community has had to change its main ideas over time. This has happened because of forces both from outside and inside the community. The community is made up of people who follow Buddha's teachings. Forces from outside the community are from people who do not believe in Buddhism.\n\nWe need to know some important words to understand what we are talking about. An internal force is a force that comes from people inside the Buddhist community. An external force is a force that comes from people outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is a force that hurts the community. A benign force is a force that does not hurt or help the community.\n\nWe will use these words a lot in this discussion. Now, let's talk about the main ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of three parts: the Tripitaka. This has many texts that explain Buddhism. The Sutta Pitaka has the Suttas. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world. These ideas include no soul, suffering in life, and that everything is changing.\n\nBy understanding these ideas, people can stop the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. It happens over and over. Along with stopping Sansara, people can also stop desire, hatred, and delusion. These are the things that come from being not enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for how to live. For people who are not monks, there are five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not behave improperly with someone of the opposite sex, and do not take drugs. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be stopped.",
            "Two countries, the United States and Mexico, had a long rivalry. It lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry had a big fight, the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The United States won and took Texas and the American Southwest.\n\nThe two countries had many other fights. They disagreed on issues like religion, culture, and tradition. They also disagreed on things they wanted like money and trade. This is like many other countries that have rivalries with their neighbors. \n\nWhen countries share a border, they often have disagreements. This can create problems between the countries. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries with long rivalries. They share a border and have had many disagreements.\n\nOne reason for the rivalry was a difference in religion. The United States and Mexico had different views on what was important. This was a big problem between the two countries. Many other countries have had disagreements over religion throughout history.\n\nA long time ago, the English and Spanish had a disagreement. This feeling of distrust was passed down to the United States and Mexico. This made it hard for the two countries to be friends.\n\nThere were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these fights were about territory and who controlled the land. There were also problems with people crossing the border and causing trouble.\n\nAs time went on, Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States' goals changed from wanting more land to wanting to help Mexico. This helped end the rivalry between the two countries.",
            "Fifteen years ago I became very sick. I was a nurse at the time. I chose this job because I wanted a safe and secure life. I did not have a safe and secure life when I was a child. People said, \"You will always have a job. People will always get sick.\" So, I chose nursing. I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nNow I am 46 years old and I am not working. I do not have much money. I get a little money from the government, but it is not enough. I get by, but it is hard every day. I am not safe or secure anymore. But I know one thing: I could not have made it without my family and a few good friends. They helped me a lot. When bad things happen, it is hard to feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen in life. We cannot prepare for everything. Some things are too big to handle alone.\n\nI agree that we should not put all our trust in the government. It is not strong. I think we should learn to trust each other again. We should help each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe people who want to be independent say that is how America was built. But it was not just independence that helped them. They had compassion, respect for each other, and shared their resources.\n\nSo, be prepared. I have a kit with food, water, and other things I need in case of an emergency. I also have a first aid kit and a way to purify water. If you have a farm and can grow your own food, that is a good idea. But also get to know your neighbors and ask for help if you need it.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that affect how they change? Even a long time ago, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that scientists have not yet found a way to explain the simplest living things in a simple way. Today, scientists are using math to understand how living things grow and change. Recently, math was used to study how mollusks, a group of animals with shells, grow their shells. Our study is trying to use math to understand how living things change over time. We are using math to study how a type of mollusk called Prunum grows its shell.\n\nTo do this, we used pictures of Prunum shells to find numbers that we can use to model how the shell grows. We used a special computer program called CerioShell to create models of what the shell might look like. These models can help us understand how living things can change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It grows around a center point, and it has lines that separate each part of the shell. We can count how many parts there are and study how they grow. We can also study how the shell grows as the animal moves through time and space.\n\nWe can use math to show how the shell grows and change over time. This can help us understand how living things change and grow. We can use this information to create new ideas about how living things change over time.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that grows in a circle. The circle is divided into parts called whorls. Each whorl is like a ring that grows around the center of the shell. The center of the shell is called the columella. The whorls grow around the columella, and a line called a suture separates each whorl. The last whorl is the biggest, and the rest of the shell is called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways, such as from the top, bottom, or side. We can also count the whorls by drawing a line from the top and counting the parts. We can use math to show how the shell grows and changes over time.\n\nWe can study how the shell grows by tracing the path of the aperture. The aperture is the opening of the shell, and we can use math to show how it changes over time. This can help us understand how living things change and grow.",
            "The number of babies and young children dying in Indonesia has not changed much in the last ten years.  Indonesia is making progress on some of the goals set for the year 2015, like providing clean water and sanitation.  But the country is not improving as quickly as it needs to on health for mothers and babies.  We will look at the reasons for this below.  They show that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger, not just improve specific programs.\n\nMore women in Indonesia are giving birth with a trained health worker.  Now, 72% of births have a trained worker.  However, this number still includes traditional workers who cannot help if the birth is complicated.  Many mothers die because of bleeding after childbirth.  So, the progress in this area is not as good as it seems.  There are also fewer children with diarrhea who visit a health professional.  We do not have complete information on care for new mothers.  But it is clear that this is a problem.  Many areas of the country have low rates of care for new mothers.\n\nNot enough women in Indonesia have a C-section when they need one.  Only 4% of births are C-sections.  The percentage is higher in cities, 7%, but lower in rural areas, 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  This is a problem of fairness.  Another problem is that people who are poor have a harder time getting healthcare.  There is a 27% gap in who uses healthcare services between the richest and poorest people.  The poor cannot afford to pay out of their own money for healthcare.\n\nThe next question is how to make healthcare better for babies and mothers.  The main question is how to make sure there are enough healthcare services.  Should Indonesia develop special programs or make its healthcare system better?  It is clear that special programs can solve specific problems.  They have clear goals and can give quick results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  One problem is that if we spend a lot of money on one area, we may not have enough money for other areas.  Also, many programs can make it hard to coordinate services and give too much paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed stories about people of high social class in England during that time. But two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They use mystery and strange events to make the characters more interesting. These elements help readers understand the characters' feelings and reasons for their actions.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses strange and confusing ideas to show Oliver's feelings. For example: \"He was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were yelling. The words they said sounded in his ears. When he finally paid attention, he found he was talking to them.\" Oliver is very confused and scared. The strange visions make the reader understand how Oliver feels.\n\nThe strange events in Oliver Twist often happen in Oliver's dreams. These dreams show the reader what is wrong with Oliver and what he is feeling. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers the shooting of his friend. He relives the event in his mind, like a dream. Oliver is very scared and does not know what is happening. He is also very hurt and in a lot of pain.\n\nOliver has no control over what happens to him. He does not try to stop the bad things that happen. The shooting in the story shows that Oliver has no control over his life. He is influenced by the people around him, like the bad man Fagin. This makes Oliver feel defeated and without hope.\n\nWuthering Heights is another novel that uses strange and confusing events to make the characters more interesting. The author writes: \"The day passed quickly. There was no day – it was gone as soon as it started. The night was long and quiet, but it passed quickly.\"",
            "I worked in an after-school program two years ago. I helped Elementary age students with their studies. I was good at English and reading. The program's instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian. He was in third or fourth grade. He was having trouble reading. I helped him for a time, but I saw that something was not right. Some letters he read well, but others he did not understand. He spoke perfect English, but this was strange.\n\nI asked his mother for help. She did not speak English. I spoke a little Spanish, but not much. We tried to talk, but it was hard. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet. I hope this helped him.\n\nI tell this story because there is a big problem in schools: the language barrier. This is a big problem in California. Even a child who speaks good English can have trouble reading. I think everyone agrees that this is a problem. So, what can we do? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading helped. But for children who do not speak much English, the answer is not simple. There is no one answer. We need to use many approaches.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps children who speak Spanish, and all children. Children in bilingual programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all children will benefit. How can we do this? We do not need all teachers to be bilingual. But we can have special helpers who are bilingual.",
            "Most people are told from a young age that there is something bigger than them in the world. This idea is often taught in school or church. Some people learn about it in Sunday school, others in Temple, and some find their own answers. Many people accept the ideas of their parents. But some people reject these ideas and think there is nothing beyond what they can see and touch.\n\nWe look for answers to big questions about life. We want to know what is out there and what it means. We search for a way to understand the world. We try to find a light in the dark to guide us.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on a porch together. It was raining and the sound of the rain was loud. He looked out into the rain and seemed to be thinking about something. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and scared because I knew he was going to die soon.\n\nMy father died in December, a few days after my birthday. He was sick and the doctors were trying to help him, but it was not working. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember him as he was, not as he was when he was sick.

            "The Gothic Novel is a strange name for a story about old and new ideas. Ian Watt says it is like an \"oxymoron\" - two things that do not mix. People have criticized the Gothic mode for not being deep, and also praised it for its powerful and exciting parts. \n\nThe first Gothic Novel was \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He used old ideas from \"ancient\" romances and new ideas from modern novels to create the Gothic style. He mixed old theatrical elements with new ways of writing to make a new kind of story. \n\nThe Gothic style uses many old ideas from medieval times, like old buildings and old traditions. Even when \"The Castle of Otranto\" was first published, the word \"gothic\" was used to describe many things, like old peoples and old styles. It was seen as old-fashioned compared to new ideas in society and literature.\n\nThe mix of old and new ideas is what makes the Gothic style interesting. It stays interesting for a long time, even if the reader is far from the time when it was written. \n\nOne of the most important ideas in Gothic stories is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It was important to Gothic writers because it represented a perfect knight who was brave, honorable, and good. They saw that society was not living up to this ideal, and they wanted to change it. \n\nThe idea of chivalry was used in \"The Castle of Otranto\" to make the past seem better than the present. This was a way of saying that society had lost something important. The writer, Horace Walpole, was writing during a difficult time in history. He was unhappy with the way society was going, and he wanted to make people think about what was important. \n\nOne character in the story, Frederic, is a good example of a chivalric knight. He is a prince who has been through hard times and is a good person. His description in the story includes many traditional ideas about chivalry, like being a gallant and courteous knight.",
            "Supply Chain Management\n------------------------\n\nSupply chain management is the process of moving goods from the customer order to the customer. It includes the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution. The term supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to provide good customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It is the base of the whole process. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to understand what customers need. The market is a good guide to decide what customers demand. Managers decide what products to make and how many. They also choose where to make the products, considering customer demand and satisfaction.\n\nThe next step is to plan workloads and maintenance. Production is a very important part. Every detail matters. If details are not planned correctly, it can cost a company time and money.\n\nSupply is the second key part of the supply chain. It includes making strategic decisions about a company's capabilities and partnerships. A company may have many divisions for a single product. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They may also outsource work to other companies to save time and money.\n\nInventory is the third key part. It includes storing and managing goods before they are sold. Location is the fourth part. It includes choosing the best place to make and store products. Transportation is the fifth part. It includes moving goods from one place to another. Information is the sixth part. It includes sharing information between companies and customers.\n\nManagers use these six parts to provide good customer service. They make sure the right products are made, stored, and delivered to customers on time. This helps a company be successful.",

She holds it up, and the message is written on it in black. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. It is ruled by a group of military leaders who took power in 1962. They did not win power through an election.\n\nIn 2007, people on the street began to protest. This was the first time people had protested in ten years. The protests were led by monks. The monks wore yellow robes. After the first protests, more and more people joined in. The government was not happy. The government did not want people to protest.\n\nThe government allowed the monks to meet peacefully, but then the situation became violent. The military attacked the monks and their monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested. One journalist was killed while he was reporting on the protests.\n\nThis is not the only time that a government has tried to stop people from speaking out against it. Many governments throughout history have tried to stop people from protesting. In ancient Rome, the emperor thought they were chosen by the gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor is thought to be a god. In the United States, the president had meetings with a man who leads a group that is against freedom.\n\nThere are many examples of governments hurting their own people. In 1989, people in China protested against their government. The government did not like this, and many people were killed. In Rwanda, a group of people killed anyone who was not like them. Germany, under Hitler, killed many Jewish people.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Governments have been hurting their own people for a long time.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He lived a long life, which helped him create many new and important works of music for his orchestra. In many of his compositions, Ellington's piano playing is not very loud. However, as a composer, he was very good at making music that showed each member of the band. He created a framework for band members to play with freedom. Ellington also wrote music that was tightly organized and used the special style of each band member to show musical ideas. This created a new and original sound for each piece.\n\nEllington was very good at understanding how to make each band member sound good. He knew how to make the band sound good together as a group. This skill allowed him to write some of the most innovative and great music in jazz history.\n\nIn his music, Ellington often used the voice to add a new sound to his music. This is shown in his song \"Creole Love Call.\" In this song, he used the voice as a musical instrument. It was one of the first times he did this in his career. The song is a slow, twelve-bar blues that has six parts. Each part is different.\n\nPart 1: The song starts with a call and response between the voice and the reeds. The voice starts with a smooth sound and then becomes rougher at the end.\nPart 2: A muted trumpet player plays a solo. The solo makes the melody more interesting and uses many blue notes.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast, high solo while the piano plays a subtle rhythm.\nPart 4: The whole band plays like the first part, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nPart 5: The reeds start the call and response in a high voice. The brass and rhythm sections play a strong, rhythmic pattern.\nPart 6: The song returns to the first part, with a call and response between the voice and the reeds. In this part, the voice sounds like a musical instrument.\n\nIn another song, \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington uses his skill at making tight music with his band. He also uses his ear to make new and interesting sounds. In this song, a trumpet player and a singer use their voices to create a rich sound.\n\nIn \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington uses a trombone player to make the melody sound new and interesting.",

Some boys liked her, but she did not like them. She often thought about what could be causing this.

            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" affects the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study found that eating a diet high in plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and low in animal products and saturated fats, can reduce this risk.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that eating a Mediterranean-style diet can help people live longer and prevent heart disease. However, this study focused on the connection between the diet and stroke.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women were part of a larger study of nurses in 11 US states. The researchers asked the women about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. They found that women who ate a Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nTo make sure the results were accurate, the researchers looked at medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates to confirm cases of heart disease and stroke. They also accounted for other factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. In fact, women who ate the most Mediterranean-style foods were 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke than those who ate the least.\n\nThis study shows that eating a Mediterranean-style diet can be an effective way to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. This diet is not only good for the heart, but it may also help people live longer and healthier lives.",
            "The United States had a big financial crisis in 2007. Many people lost their jobs, the housing market fell, and some big companies were in trouble. This problem is still a problem today. So, we must ask: how did this problem happen and how can we stop it? The financial crisis happened because of bad and foolish decisions made by politicians. They pushed banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks and companies then sold these loans to other places, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These companies mixed the loans together and sold them to others. When the people who borrowed the money could not pay, the banks and companies were in trouble. \n\nThis problem began in 1999. President Clinton wanted a second term in office. He wanted to be popular. So, he made it easier for banks to give loans to people who could not afford them. A reporter at the New York Times reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae was under pressure from the government to give loans to people who earn little money. The company wanted to grow and make more money.\" The reporter said this could cause big problems if the economy slowed down. And it did. \n\nSome new kinds of loans were used to buy homes. These loans had rates that could change, and they were complicated. They were mixed together and sold to many people. This made many people borrow too much money. When the housing market fell, they could not pay back the money. The big banks and companies that bought these loans were in trouble. They lost $4.1 trillion dollars in 2007. This is a big number. It is one-third of the country's total money. Some companies were sold, and some were forced to change the way they work. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion dollars in loans and were taken over by the government in 2008.",

It's like a guest that you don't want to invite to your party.\n\nWe already know the rule: \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes mistakes.  She writes a lot of words that tell the reader what happened.  And it makes the reader bored.\n\nExposition is when you tell the reader about the story.  It's like a character telling another character a lot of information.  But your readers don't want to hear it.  They want to see it.\n\nLet's look at an example.  You read a story and you learn that a woman met her husband a long time ago.  They got married in a big ceremony.  And then he died in front of her.  But you don't want to read about all of it happening in a few lines.  You want to see the husband's character.  You want to see how much he loved her.  And you want to see how much she loved him.\n\nIf the story tells you that she was happy with him, you want to see it in her words and actions.  You want to see her smile when she thinks of him.  You want to see her cry when she remembers him.  That way, you can feel her sadness.  And you can feel her love for him.\n\nSo, as a writer, you need to give the reader more.  You need to show, not tell.  Don't make your readers fall asleep or click the \"Back\" button.  Give them meat on the bone.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was live this morning (August 13, 2011) on NBC 4. The main story was about a man named Shad Hostettler. He stabbed his wife many times in Ashley, Ohio. He was arrested. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news was only two minutes long. I think it was enough time.\n\nThe second story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically hurt. Police did not have any suspects. A special police team was working on the case. I thought this story was short. I think it was because the man who was shot was black and from a black neighborhood. I have noticed that the news does not give as much attention to minorities who are victims of crimes. If a white person is a victim, the news talks about it a lot.\n\nThe next story was about a gun hole in a helicopter. It was a .22 caliber bullet that hit the helicopter. Police want people to tell them who did it. They will give a reward of five thousand dollars to anyone who helps.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be in the mid to low eighties. The news did not talk about this for very long.\n\nThey also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man robbed the store. He wore a black sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought the news talked about this man being black a lot.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug seller in Texas. He was in a group that sold marijuana in Ohio from Texas. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison. The news also said he was Hispanic. I did not think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special friendship between brothers. It is a strong and unbreakable bond. This friendship has many feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other more than anyone else. They see themselves in each other. In hard times, this bond is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they make a big difference. Part of understanding brotherly love is dealing with the problems it causes. When you look at your brother, you see yourself. You see the good and the bad. Your actions and what happens because of them show who you really are. The story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this. Two brothers go on a difficult journey. They have many strong feelings. In the end, one brother survives, but the other does not. The story shows how one of the brothers feels proud and resentful towards his brother. The brother wants a brother he can play with and teach things to. But his brother is very sick and cannot do these things. The brother is very sad and angry. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels happy and loving. This shows that he cares about his brother. This is a complex feeling that shows the love and anger of brotherhood.\n\nThe main character's actions are driven by one main feeling: pride. He wants a brother who can play with him and learn from him. He wants a brother who can run and climb with him. But his brother is very sick and cannot do these things. The brother is very sad and angry that his brother cannot be the brother he wants. This is shown when he thinks about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels happy and loving. This shows that he cares about his brother and loves him.",
            "The human brain is a very complicated system. It helps us think and learn. As technology has improved, people have used different ideas to explain how the brain works. They compared it to a tablet made of wax, then to a piece of paper, and now to a computer. These ideas are useful, but they have limits. They can also lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain gets information from our senses. These are like special helpers that turn what we see, hear, touch, and taste into signals. The brain uses these signals to make decisions. It does this in two parts: bottom-up and top-down. \n\nImagine you see a picture of a black box on a white background. The bottom-up process looks at the picture and says, \"I see some black and white colors, and some lines that mean this is a box.\" The top-down process uses this information to say, \"I know this is a box, not a hole in the white background.\" \n\nWhen the brain gets information, it decides how important it is. This helps choose what we pay attention to. For example, we might see many blades of grass, but we only notice a few. We might also hear our name in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain stores information in three types: sensory, working, and long-term. We get sensory information from our senses. Working memory stores information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Long-term memory keeps information for a long time. Scientists think that working memory is like a short signal that goes through some brain cells. Long-term memory is like a special kind of protein that keeps the information.\n\nThere are many theories about how we organize our knowledge in the brain. Some ideas come from how people remember things, some come from computer science, and some come from studying the brain. One idea is that our brain has small places that connect to each other. These places are like concepts, and they connect to each other because they are related. For example, our brain might connect the idea of a \"chair\" to the idea of a \"table,\" which is connected to the idea of \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "The writer Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of new technology and the way it is supported by the system of capitalism. In his novel Brave New World, he pictures a bad future where people value groups over individuals and seek happiness right away. People are taught from a young age to choose pleasure above all else. The citizens are shown to be controlled by a single system, ruled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. \n\nIf we look at the book through the ideas of Marxism, we can see that the writer is warning us about the problems of the economy of his time. Huxley uses special words from Marxism, such as the idea of equality for everyone being the same, and how people are controlled by the rules of society.\n\nHuxley makes fun of capitalism in the book by showing how the common people are not aware of their relationship with the more powerful people in society. They are only interested in getting richer and more things. This is because the system is designed to keep them from knowing the truth. The people in the book, like the Delta and Gamma classes, do not have their own ideas. They are forced to follow the rules and buy things they do not need.\n\nThe wealthy people in the book are in control and do nothing to change the system. The interactions between the different people in the book show that they are very unkind to each other. They do not really know each other, and they do not care about each other's feelings. The writer may be saying that the rise of new technology and capitalism takes away people's freedom and ability to express themselves.\n\nThe people in the book do not have real love or deep feelings. They are only interested in looking good and having fun. The way the people in the different classes accept their place in society shows how the system of capitalism affects people's lives. They are happy to obey the rules and stay in line with what is expected of them.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for two and a half years. It can be hard for students to get around campus. My first year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls. It is far from many buildings, including the Willard building. It takes me 25 minutes to walk from my home to classes in Willard when the weather is bad. I talked to an older student and learned that the East Halls were once separated from the rest of the school by empty land. Now, that space has buildings, sports fields and apartments. As the campus grows, it gets harder to get from one place to another. A good solution is the bicycle. But students must ride them and the campus needs to help.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said, \"Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.\" Bicycles are good for your body. They are also the fastest way to travel. A simple breakfast and some exercise will take you 30 miles or more. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. The smartest thing I did was buy a bike. I ride to Thomas building for class. It takes me 5 minutes if I pedal fast. The problem is, Pollock Road is not an easy road to ride on.\n\nThere are good things about walking too. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That is two and a half hours every week. I don't have time for that."
