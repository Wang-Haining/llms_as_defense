            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm planning on pursuing an education in social work with the ultimate goal of joining the Division of Family and Children Services to help kids who've been through abuse or neglect, as well as offer support to troubled families. When it comes to social work, I'm all about bringing the following core values to the table: service, respect, an honest approach, and dedication to making relationships between people better, along with constantly working on myself to stay sharp in my field. These values aren't just important for social workers; they're super important to me personally.\n\nI've always had a desire to help others, but I wasn't sure what career path I wanted to take. Throughout high school and college, I saw a lot of people trying to run away from their problems instead of facing them, and some turned to not-so-great coping mechanisms. Because of what I've seen, I decided to major in Psychology. Still unsure about my career path, I took a break after I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old who was really nervous because he was staying with her – he was trying to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I found out that he'd called the police to their house. I went over to their place and talked to the police about my concerns, explaining that I'd just graduated from Piedmont College with a degree in Psychology. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I questioned them, they seemed really nervous and made excuses for their son's behavior, saying he was just trying to get people involved in \"simple\" family disputes. That experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to help kids deal with similar problems.\n\nI'm also really passionate about social justice. Society says that the individual is important, but we end up trying to be like everyone else instead of embracing our uniqueness. I'm all about being an individual and not limiting myself to what others think I should be. Throughout high school and college, I protested against social injustice in any way I could: I'd dye my hair weird colors, wear clothes that fit my style, get piercings that went against the norm, and speak out against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep speaking out against it.",
            "This paper explores the connection between the Biological and Sociocultural models and insomnia. The Biological model focuses on the genetic information passed down from our parents and medical aspects, while the Sociocultural model looks at the impact of environment on sleep, including things like where you live, your race, ethnicity, and income level. To understand these models, we'll look at various studies that relate to them and use them to explain each one better. We'll also critique the research to point out its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be broken down into three categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders that are connected to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical problems or substances. The primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias, which are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and Parasomnias, which are sleep disorders that cause weird behaviors or physical things to happen while you're asleep. The Dyssonmias include Primary Insomnia, where you can't fall asleep or stay asleep, Primary Hypersomnia, where you can't stay awake, Narcolepsy, which involves extreme sleepiness and hallucinations, and a few others. The Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe sleep disorders connected to other mental health issues are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders. The Biological and Sociocultural models are especially useful for understanding the primary sleep disorders. Research on the Biological model has found that the hypothalamus in our brain has special cells that control our sleep-wake cycle. Scientists have done studies with mice and found that these cells have something called orexin, which helps us stay awake or fall asleep. They've also found that a receptor called GABAB is responsible for sleep and wakefulness. When this receptor is activated, it helps us fall asleep, and when it's not working right, it can cause problems with sleep. A study using a special medication called baclofen found that it can help people sleep better by activating the GABAB receptor. This shows that there's a link between our genes and our ability to sleep. This has sociocultural implications, because if we inherit a problem with the GABAB receptor, it could affect our sleep and make it hard for us to focus on everyday tasks.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), which is a pretty complex topic. So, to start, let's break it down: CAPD is basically how well the brain uses the sounds it hears. It's a weird way to put it, but essentially, the brain can't process what we hear in a normal way. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but it's like their brain's sound-decoding skills are a bit wonky. It's not about not being able to hear, it's about how the brain takes what we hear and turns it into something that makes sense.\n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first started noticing that some kids with speech problems had trouble processing sounds. A team of Italian researchers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, started working on tests for these kids in 1954, and in 1961, a researcher named Kimura came up with a way to understand how the brain handles sounds. This all led to a big conference in 1977 that got more people interested in studying CAPD.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of different ways: someone with CAPD might have trouble pinpointing where sounds are coming from, or might get confused when there are multiple sounds happening at once. They might also struggle to recognize patterns in sounds, or tell when someone's being sarcastic, or block out one sound if another sound comes after it. It's like their brain's sound-sorting system is a bit messed up. They might also have trouble making sense of sounds in a way that they can use them in real life, or figuring out the order of sounds.\n\nSo, to figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors and specialists use a bunch of different tests to see how they respond to sounds. This can include watching how they behave when they're listening, or asking them questions and seeing how they react. There's no single test that's super reliable, and nobody really knows what causes CAPD. The tests usually involve playing a bunch of sounds at the same time and asking the person to pick out specific ones, or recording the sounds in their ear and seeing how their brain responds.",

The problem with giving up the act is that you might end up all alone, cut off from the people around you. It's a tough choice - do you take care of yourself or do you take care of the people you care about? Some people might not even get mad if they figure out you've been lying, but others will definitely be super ticked off.\n\nThe whole idea of dressing up as the opposite sex gets even more complicated because it makes you wonder why anyone would want to change who they are in the first place.

She says, \"I'll meet a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) She has to pretend to be a guy because she's in a new place and doesn't want to get hurt. But by doing that, she ends up losing her support system and even makes people think she's a different person, like Sebastian. Olivia totally falls for her, and Viola also has to deal with some weird feelings for Orsino. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) It's all pretty weird.\n\nSome people might see Twelfth Night as a way to explore how pretending to be someone else can help you figure out your true feelings. Like, Olivia and Orsino might be hiding something, and Viola's disguise is like a wake-up call for them. The way they react to Viola makes you wonder if they were really attracted to her as a guy or if they were just freaked out by their own feelings. It's like Shakespeare is poking fun at people who judge others based on how they look. Olivia is totally shallow, because she goes from loving Cesario to loving Sebastian without even a second thought, and then just thinks of Viola as a sister. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial empire was known for its brutality, especially in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing it as just that doesn't do it justice. The empire was all over the map in terms of policies and ruling styles, like its geography. Different colonies had different approaches to education too. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that the locals were already pretty educated and literate. German education efforts in Kamerun and other colonies got some positive reviews from the time.\n\nBut German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was a whole different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government set up schools and was really involved in teaching the locals, they pretty much left education to missionary groups who didn't get a lot of support from the government. The government did invest in educating Europeans living there, though - they set up their own schools and really helped out the missionary schools. These decisions had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population was basically uneducated and illiterate. It's not like one single thing caused this difference, though - it was a bunch of social, political, and economic factors that made South West Africa's experience unique.\n\nThere's actually a lot of research out there about education in the German colonies, but most of it is in German and was written a long time ago. Early studies were mainly just describing the educational systems in each colony. Later studies in English did some cool comparisons between different colonies and really dug deep into the details. One of the most important studies on this topic is Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen looked at how the two colonies were similar and different and figured out some of the reasons behind those differences. According to Cohen, the fact that there were so many settlers in South West Africa explains a lot about the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a pretty good climate, considering it's mostly desert, so there were a lot of Europeans living there by 1913 - almost 15,000, which is way more than in East Africa. The settlers in South West Africa were actually pretty lucky to be living in a place with a relatively nice climate.",
            "Heavy Metal music has evolved a ton over the past century, and it's hard to even try to list all the genres. To make things even more complicated, most of these genres have spawned sub and sub-sub genres. It's crazy to think about how far it's come, especially considering that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. This is because it shows a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean towards the darker side. People started to realize that Heavy Metal had real flexibility and took advantage of it to create their own sub-genre, followed by sub-sub-genres, and it just keeps going.\n\nNowadays, we're at a point where there are so many niches of groups that it's hard to figure out what Heavy Metal even is. It's incorporated so many themes from other genres, but it all started somewhere. To understand the Metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta know what the Metal movement is and why it's a movement, not just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is basically a movement defined by darkness. It's like, more of everything - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatrics. It's way less about being raw and basic; in Metal bands, people are super skilled at playing their instruments, and that comes through in the music. Plus, Metal is a movement that's super influenced by drugs - the psychedelic boom in the '70s got people pretty wild, and that's when some of the craziest, otherworldly records started coming out. It's got all these dark, visceral qualities that were new to the music scene because most popular music was all about being happy and light. Later generations of Metal took some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Some lyrics, like these from Helter Skelter, show just how dark Metal can get. It's like the Beatles' darker side, all about ups and downs, kinda like being on drugs. Some people even consider this song to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs ever. It was a response to the Rolling Stones, who were also getting darker and heavier with their music. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "It's pretty cool to think that before the Surrealists were making their dreamy art, Henri Rousseau was actually living his own dream, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a painting he made in 1910, shows a woman who's in awe of the cool stuff she's seeing in her dreamland, but it also represents Rousseau's own goals as an artist. He had been hoping to get recognized by other artists and art lovers for a long time, but he was stuck with a weird problem: should he try to fit in with the art world by copying other artists, or be true to himself and do his own thing? The Dream is like his masterpiece that shows how he struggled with this for his whole career – wanting to be accepted by the art world he loved, but also wanting to be different and make his own unique art.\n\nTo really get what The Dream is all about, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His dad was a tinsmith who was pretty successful, but Rousseau never got any formal art training – he just worked a regular job until he was 40. People even started calling him a customs inspector, but that's not what he really did (Shattuck 46). When his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their babies, Rousseau was left with a ton of grief and a young daughter, Julia. He started painting to help him deal with the pain and move on. Unlike some other artists of his time, Rousseau wasn't all about painting the perfect peasant scene – he was just a regular guy with regular hopes and dreams.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Rousseau wanted to fit in with the art world – he was starting from scratch, and he was working with some really talented artists who were already famous. He didn't get recognized until around the same time that Matisse was making a name for himself. As author Jan Gordon pointed out in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were different in a lot of ways – not just in their art style, but also why they made art in the first place. While Matisse was all about not being boring, Rousseau just wanted to make art that was good enough to get him into the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "You know, people have been saying for ages that there's a deep connection between how we think about right and wrong, and how we think about what's beautiful and what's not. I'm convinced that there's a reason for this. As John Keats so wisely put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we learn in life comes from school or through our experiences, but somehow, we naturally know what's beautiful and what's the right thing to do, even if no one taught us. Both ethics and aesthetics are all about explaining why something is beautiful or right, rather than telling us how to decide what's good art or good behavior. \n\nIn other words, when we talk about why we like a particular painting, or why we think a certain action is the right thing to do, we can't really put our finger on it. A conversation about the Mona Lisa might go on and on about its lighting or the culture behind it, but ultimately, that doesn't capture what makes it so great. When someone asks you about your favorite book or piece of art, you often end up saying \"There's just something about it\" before trying to come up with a more thoughtful explanation. I think that both art and morality have this quality to them - they can't be fully explained by just listing their good qualities. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Even if we try to describe a book in detail, there's something more to it that we can't quite put into words. I think that this is true for ethics too - as Ludwig Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think that this \"something\" - this intangible quality - is what makes art and morality so powerful, and that it's what connects them.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are closely related because we experience them in a way that's hard to explain. They affect us on a deep level, but we can't quite put into words. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature - as McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are not as relevant to other arts, like music, but they seem to be just as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's got this amazing vibe going on right now, it's like a super strong country with its own unique culture that you can feel all the way from the Alps in München down to the Baltic sea city of Kiel.  You can sense it in Köln on the Rhine, in the middle of the country, and even in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany's culture is a mix of different sources and tribes, considering how it all came together. \n\nGermania is basically the ancestral land of the Germans, but where the name actually came from is still up for debate among scholars. Some think it's from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, or even from a previous name for the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. Julius Caesar was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he took it from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between the ones he'd conquered and the ones he hadn't. He wrote in his first book, \"Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, are always at war with the Gauls. They fight the Germans almost every day.\" Others believe it might mean \"spear\" from the Old English word ger, or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, which means \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were super loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" around AD 98 that the Germans were aboriginal and not mixed with other races. He said, \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, let alone Germany, with its harsh climate, gloomy skies, and sullen people?\" It's pretty obvious the Romans wouldn't be interested in moving there, at least not yet. They'd send out their conquests to Germania to trade and occasionally lead a land campaign, but they'd mostly stay in their empire. The Germanic tribes started showing up around the first century, living on the Roman Empire's borders, trading their goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood there staring blankly at the scene before me, my mind a complete blank slate.  I just couldn't seem to grasp anything about it, like it was just a bunch of random stuff I was looking at.  My thoughts were zipping in and out of my brain too fast for me to catch them.  I was like a total robot, just processing the image without really thinking about it.\n\nI had been wanting to learn how to draw for ages, ever since I was six.  Then I got this art book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and it totally changed everything.  It teaches you all these crazy cool techniques like how to break down a picture into simple shapes and stuff.  One trick it shows you is to frame a picture with a square, which makes it way easier to draw.  But at that moment, I was so overwhelmed by the whole thing that I just couldn't even think about framing it.  I was stuck, just staring at the picture in awe.\n\nI've always been fascinated by artists who create masterpieces with crazy styles, like Picasso with his blue phase or Monet with his greenery.  If I wanted to be an artist, I figured this was my chance to make something special – I'd call it Work in Brown.  I picked up my pencil, my hand started moving, and for a second, I felt like I was totally in the zone.  But then I had to go and mess it up by trying to, ahem, take care of a little business...  My hand smacked the toilet handle, but the, um, 'present' refused to budge.  I was stuck staring at this gross brown package that someone had left behind.  I grabbed the mop, frowning, trying to get my mind off the situation.  A few more flushes, a few more minutes of me standing there, then I finally managed to get my hand into the toilet and...well, let's just say it was a real challenge.",
            "Teenage drivers are dying behind the wheel in alarming numbers.  Several factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  According to the National Institutes of Health, a big part of the problem is that the teen brain just isn't ready for the risks of driving.  Inexperience is another major factor – it not only causes more fatal accidents, but also increases the rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  And, as anyone can guess, teens often drive with their friends – which is a deadly combo.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the more underage passengers, the higher the risk of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and some other states have tried to make teens safer by requiring temporary licenses that limit their driving hours and ban other minors as passengers.  But these provisional licenses are just a temporary fix.  The real issue is that, as a group, teen drivers are just not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Researcher Marvin Zuckerman thinks that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, and he's got the stats to back it up.  A common trait among teens is the desire to take risks for the thrill of it, so it makes sense to delay driving until they're a bit older.  If we keep giving out driver's licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing deadly accidents happen, and the death toll will skyrocket in the next few years.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will hit the road, and the situation could get even more serious.\n\nLegislation to deal with this issue would be pretty straightforward.  Schools could still teach driver's education classes to get future drivers started, but no one under 18 could drive.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license, and a certain number of driving hours would still be required.  The number of hours could be based on the number already required in most states (in California, for example, that's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with a grown-up).  Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea's not new, but it's still worth considering.",
            "So I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's film collection and decided to check out the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were a total of 15 of these films, and I watched them all. Trick films use creative editing to create illusions, so I focused on analyzing the style and evolution of these early films. Most of them are pretty straightforward - they're set-bound, shot in a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and stick to the one shot equals one film rule. However, some of the later films broke free from these rules by introducing new ideas like multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was how all the trick films share the same set-up: they're all shot on a static set within a frontal proscenium. The camera stays in one place and doesn't follow the action. This style came from the theatre and, for trick films, the magic shows and vaudeville acts of the time. A big limitation of this style is that the actors can only move side-to-side, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Check out Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) for an example - the actors enter from the right and just bop back and forth across the screen.\n\nThese films also tend to use a lot of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. They never use close-ups, just like in the theatre and vaudeville days when the whole performance would be visible on stage. The actors stay in the middle ground and don't move towards the camera, so the audience never gets a close-up shot. Most of these early trick films are pretty short, lasting only a minute or so, because they follow the rule of one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits what they can do, so most of them are just simple tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, look closer at a film like The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) and you'll see that the physical shot and the conceptual shot aren't always the same thing - sometimes a single shot is made up of multiple physical shots to create an illusion.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was super into the idea of Republicanism and was always speaking his mind about personal freedom and government. As a farmer, his job and his short stint in politics made him known for being outspoken and dedicated. His love for the country life influenced just about all his thoughts on government, especially when it came to how a system should work. He thought that preserving and supporting agriculture was the key to making good arguments about things like power, rules, and the courts.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to create the perfect system because nobody was stuck in the past and telling them what to do. This meant that they could make a system where people had control over themselves. He was all about the natural rights of people, and he thought that they're all connected - if one of them gets taken away, the others get hurt too, and they're not as valuable. He thought that these rights should be off-limits to the government. He said that the \"state of nature\" was basically a world where the strong and mean people get ahead, but in a civilized society, that's not how it should be.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought that the government had to be created so that it accounted for both the good and bad in people. He was super strict about his ideas on right and wrong being two separate things. He said that since governments are run by people, they'll have all the good and bad qualities that come with being human. He thought that good principles were about protecting private property, helping farmers, and keeping capitalism in check. He believed that a government with good principles would work fairly no matter who was in charge, even if they were mostly looking out for themselves. He thought that people are self-centered, but that's not always a bad thing - it's only bad when it hurts others. A good government was needed to keep people's bad qualities in check, and it had to be watched closely to make sure it didn't add any bad principles.\n\nLike many other strong Republicans back then, Taylor wanted the government to stick to the Constitution and not do anything that wasn't clearly said in it. He thought that a big government was expensive and likely to be super controlling. However, he also thought that just following the words without thinking about what the writers meant could be really bad. He even thought that the Declaration of Independence was like the true guide for the United States because it made it clear that we're a group of states, not one single country.",
            "Going back to the data in Figure 17, we saw a drastic drop in commuter log entries during the third month of the project. That was pretty discouraging, and it wasn't easy to figure out why it happened. Winter was in full swing at our New England campus, which probably contributed to the decline in bicycle and foot traffic. Also, December signals the end of the fall semester, so people were busy wrapping up schoolwork and finals, and the commuter log might have slipped their minds. To make things worse, it's the start of the holiday season, and students and faculty get a month-long break, which means many people didn't even need to come to campus. As for January, classes resumed in late January, but I'm not sure if that's related to the low log submissions for that month. What really puzzles me, though, is why the submissions remained low in February. Maybe it's just the natural life cycle of a project - everyone gets excited at first, and then things die down. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special push to reinvigorate the project, which did lead to a surge in log submissions that month. So, we faced the tough challenge of keeping the project going despite a natural dip in interest, compounded by the semester and holiday breaks that come with higher education.\n\nAnother hurdle we faced (and any commuting project will, I guess) is that people really love their freedom, independence, and the flexibility of driving. It's a deep-seated part of our culture. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we needed to offer some serious incentives. We gave out gift cards to local spots, but it would have been cool to see how bigger prizes, like a new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car, would have affected participation. That might have helped us combat that initial dip in engagement. The prizes we offered didn't change, though - if we had announced some bigger prizes, like a bike in December and a car in January, I bet it would have made a difference.",
            "I just learned about Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs for short, and they're pretty cool.  They're like index funds but way more flexible and you can buy and sell them like stocks.  You get the good stuff about index funds like diversification, but you also get the benefits of owning individual stocks, like being able to short sell and buy on margin.  Plus, you can buy just one share, which is pretty sweet.  But the best part is that ETFs are way cheaper than the average mutual fund.  The only downside is that you have to pay a commission when you trade them, just like with stocks.  There are tons of different ETFs out there, so it's up to you to figure out which ones are the best.  In this case, we're looking at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning just those stocks is better than owning the whole ETF.  We're only looking at the top 10 because it would be crazy to try to analyze every single holding.  These 10 stocks make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets, so it's a good representation.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the whole ETF, we're going to use some math to calculate their Beta and Return.  If we had a portfolio made up of just these 10 stocks, how would it compare to the whole ETF?  The chart shows that if we just owned the top 10 stocks, our portfolio would be 16% higher in returns and have a lower Beta than the ETF.  That sounds like a pretty good deal!  But before we get too excited, we need to make sure that these results are actually significant.  To do that, we're going to look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF's standard deviation.  If the two are different, then we can say that the results are statistically significant.",
            "Dream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's top poems, and he thought it was his best work. In this poem, you'll find the word \"Thulé\" popping up in lines 6 and 56 - it was a term that Poe got from Virgil, or so says Mabbott. Virgil used it to refer to an island north of Britain that the Greeks thought was the edge of the known world. However, there's another source that might be responsible for Poe's use of the term. Poe was really into German writers, and one of his favorites was Goethe.\n\nThis is important because it shows how familiar Poe was with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, thinks that Poe copied some of his ideas from Goethe's writing. The Oxford Companion to English Literature says that Goethe was a big deal in the literary world for his poetic drama Faust, which came out in two parts, first in 1808 and again in 1832, the year Goethe died. Inside Faust's second part is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which is all about a king whose wife dies after giving him a fancy goblet. The king gets super drunk, cries a lot, and decides it's time to die too. He gives away his stuff to his kids, except the goblet, and then walks off a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and checks out. The King of Thulé is a bit like the king in Dream-Land, maybe even a dark twin of Poe's struggles with loss and drinking. Goethe's Faust was even adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his writing, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again in \"Dream-Land\", where he uses it as the opening and closing lines for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are kind of like two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place where he's haunted by dead friends and sees a world without color. This is similar to how Goethe's king feels after losing his wife - he's all alone, lost his will to live, and is just going through the motions. It's like Poe is stepping into Goethe's poem and describing it from his own perspective.\n\nGoethe was a big deal in the literary world, and Poe would have known about him for sure because of his respect for Tennyson. Poe even said that he admired Tennyson. Poe would've also been exposed to Goethe's work through all the reproductions that were happening after the original publication.",
            "Is it possible that a customer would get punitive damages in court after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store because the manager was eating dinner instead of cleaning up the mess, even though he'd been told twice about it? Probably not, but a judge wouldn't immediately dismiss the claim. To win punitive damages, the customer would have to prove that the manager was being super reckless and didn't care about the harm that could happen, which is called \"despicable\" in the law. This customer can argue that the manager should have known how bad it would be if he didn't clean up the spill because a bunch of people had already slipped and fallen in the same store just a few months ago, and he still did nothing. It's not a super strong argument, but it makes sense given that six people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009 and the manager didn't do anything about it. \n\nOn October 13th, an employee told the manager about the spill, but the manager said he was too busy eating dinner to deal with it. Another employee reminded him about 15 minutes later, and he said the same thing. Then, at 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt pretty badly. Before that accident, there had been five other slip-and-fall incidents in the same store in 2009. Now the customer is suing the store for money because of her injury and we're thinking about filing a motion to get the court to toss out the part of the lawsuit that wants punitive damages.\n\nIn California, you can get punitive damages if someone did something really bad on purpose or was super reckless and didn't care about hurting others. The law says that's called \"malice,\" and it means either intentionally causing harm or doing something super bad that you knew could hurt someone, and then going ahead and doing it anyway. In one case, a court said that's exactly what happened when someone knew something was going to be super bad, but they still chose to do it and hurt someone.",
            "About four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC, which got me thinking about a really big question: is Islam a hostile religion?  To be honest, I think this question is more relevant now than ever, especially when you look back at what's happened since 9/11.  From what I've observed, the media's view of Islam has gone from pretty negative to extremely tolerant in the US.  It's crazy to think that back in 2001, a presidential candidate with Islamic ties, like Barack Obama, would have been a total long shot.\n\nThe Story of the Prophet really caught my attention.  This biography of Muhammad conflicts with what I thought I knew about him.  I used to think that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, but the story presents him as a totally different guy - a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled by others.  People started to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out one by one.  It's weird to see how the biography is written in a way that makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, just live his life and let the miracles speak for themselves.  This kind of writing is actually misleading because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  It's like they're taking credit for Jesus' life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nI also noticed that the biography tries to show how people converted to Islam on their own, but the stories are all second- or third-hand.  It's like they're trying to prove the truth of the stories, but it makes them seem suspicious.  The thing that really gets me is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect guy who's humble, endearing, wise, and gentle, but history says the opposite.  It's hard not to wonder if Muslims today really know the truth behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's roots and the actual teachings of Jesus got lost in the shuffle as the faith evolved after his death.  If we look at it in big picture terms, we can see how Christianity drifted further and further away from its original ideas.  Nowadays, it seems like there's a growing awareness and a more progressive mindset.  Traditionalists might resist any changes, but they might not be influential enough to hold things back.  As time goes on, people will become more aware of the history of Christianity, and a desire will grow to separate the added stuff from what Jesus really taught.  It might take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable:  There will be a big reversal in Christianity's history, and it will return to its original form.  A movement will grow, and it'll strip away all the extra layers of doctrine, kind of like the clock turning backward, until all you're left with is Jesus' original message.  When this trend hits the US and Europe, it'll spread like wildfire, and people will start following Jesus' ideas like it's the 1st century all over again.  The church as an institution will still be strong, but because people will be going back to the basics, there'll be more similarity between different groups and regions, rather than differences.  History is full of examples of reversals - just think about how the Roman Empire used to hate Christians, but later they took over the empire.  Our country went from having African-American slaves to having African-American leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity, and it'll be a big reversal of history as people search for the source.  It's crucial to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors, not literal statements, for this to happen.  So what's been added to Christianity since Jesus' time?\n\nIf we go way back in time, we see only Judaism, the root of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all part of the Jewish faith.  But the Jewish people weren't a single unit - they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common folk.",
            "I think The Jungle really shows the darker side of human nature. People, deep down, are super selfish and only care about themselves. They just want to live the best life possible and don't worry about anyone else. The Jungle shows this in lots of ways. The owners and bosses of the big factories are the most obvious example. All they care about is making their companies huge and awesome, no matter who gets hurt or what gets in their way. They don't care about the pollution they're creating or the animals and people getting hurt because of it. Upton Sinclair does a great job of painting a picture of how bad it is with his words, like when he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's showing how much damage they're causing and how the owners don't care about anyone or anything getting hurt. They're just all about the money.\n\nThe bosses and owners also didn't care about their workers who were making them rich. They would do anything to save a buck, like, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They made their workers work super long hours and then would lay off huge groups of people without any warning or help. Back then, there weren't many laws to protect workers' safety or well-being, so the bosses and owners were basically in charge and could do whatever they wanted. They expected the workers to just deal with the terrible conditions they were living and working in, and there were no organizations to help them. The unions that formed were more of a problem because they made money off the workers. It was like the workers were slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery\".",
            "A lot of authors are really good at making readers feel a certain way about important topics. They use different techniques to do this, but some are way more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master at this in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs up words that don't usually go together to give readers a certain vibe about a subject. Other times, he gives a symbol meaning and then uses it for the same thing. Fitzgerald does this with lots of colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for some of these colors, like white and gray, and then uses that meaning to make readers feel a certain way about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald uses the technique of giving meaning to colors and then using them to make readers feel something in a big way with white and gray. He makes white mean something fancy and high class, while gray is more old and faded. He sets this up at the start of the novel by using both colors all the time. Everyone's always wearing white - Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" all the time (8), and even guys like Nick and Tom are wearing white too: Nick's got \"white flannels\" (41) for Gatsby's party, and Tom's wearing a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle. Even Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick's describing Gatsby's party, and the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald takes it to the next level by using these colors to describe boring, everyday things: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56) on his way to work, and the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. He even describes ordinary people and places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27). After Fitzgerald gets this meaning across, he uses white and gray to make readers see certain subjects as unimportant or just part of a crowd. This starts with Daisy. After a while without using these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74), and readers start to see her as just a uniform thing that Gatsby wants and longs for. He uses more of this technique around Daisy to make her seem like just a uniform addition, for example, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she's again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a super productive agricultural hotspot thanks to its amazing climate. It's all sunshine and mild vibes here. You can grow all sorts of tasty crops like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a huge demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the area, with many local groups having crazy long waiting lists. People are totally into organic eggs and milk too. Some of these organic farms even offer tours, hiking trails, and birdwatching spots, which is a win-win for the landowner and the environment. This kind of setup lets them tap into government programs that benefit both the farmer and the wildlife. It's like killing two birds with one stone.\n\nOrganic farming has its perks, like a more diverse range of plants and wildlife in the area because there are no yucky chemicals in the soil and water. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Organic farming can be way more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming. You have to spend more time and effort removing pests and weeds and fertilizing the soil without using harsh chemicals. And, let's be real, organic farms often have higher losses and are way less efficient than big commercial operations. On top of that, some beneficial practices that help wildlife, like planting cover crops and removing invasive species, can be super time-consuming and costly. So, it's no wonder the landowner in this scenario might be looking for some financial help or expert advice to maximize both their profits and wildlife-friendly practices.\n\nThe land I'm talking about is a 160-acre plot near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. This land is in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still a work in progress, but it currently covers over a hundred plant and animal species, including some that are super rare and endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and might be listed as endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land has been home to Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing and wood production for a while. I chose this piece of land from a real estate website and did some research on government programs that might help a small farmer like this one reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. I even found an organic farm in the same area that I used as a model for what this landowner might try to achieve.",
            "When it comes to negotiation, culture plays a huge role. Culture isn't something that can be defined by just a few words, and it's not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing. It's the opposite of what you might think it is, and it's often different from what you might expect. For example, saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are super accommodating\" is way too broad and doesn't really capture the full picture. What's more helpful to a negotiator is understanding what a culture's values and attitudes are, and how they might impact the negotiation. When you're dealing with a culture that's different from your own, you end up comparing it to your own culture, and that's when things can get pretty relatable. \n\nTrying to understand a foreign culture or mindset can be a real challenge. It might involve studying its history or figuring out its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, you should just accept it for what it is and work with it, especially when you're in a tough bargaining position. And even if you're the one who's visiting someone else's turf, showing respect for their traditions and values can really help you get past any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nBut here's the thing: culture isn't just about national differences. Even within the same country, companies can have their own unique corporate cultures. For example, some companies might value long hours in the office, while others are way more relaxed. You can see evidence of this in things like dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. And let me tell you, American corporate culture is all over the map - some companies are super formal, while others are super casual. It's like you need to dig deeper to really understand what's going on.\n\nValues are even more important to get a handle on, because they're like the underlying reason why a culture is the way it is. If a culture values things like saving face or communal harmony, you can bet that a negotiator from that culture won't be willing to publicly shame their company or their boss to get a good deal. On the other hand, if a culture values getting a hard bargain, you won't see the negotiator settling for anything less than the best deal possible. So, it's really helpful to consider these kinds of things before you sit down at the negotiation table. And, if you can, it's even better to get to know your opponent on a personal level - it can really make the negotiation go more smoothly.",
            "The quote 'There is no God' isn't a phrase you'd hear from St. Anselm or St. Thomas Aquinas. That's a line from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and it's where Anselm starts his argument for the existence of God. This belief is also shared by Thomas Aquinas. Since their arguments are both in defense of the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both right, and we'll compare them later. To keep things simple, we'll only talk about their arguments for the God of the Bible. If we were to consider other types of gods, it wouldn't let us fairly compare their ideas. \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's assume both Anselm and Aquinas are correct in their belief in God. We'll show that, even though they bring up valid points, neither of them provides a complete basis for believing in God.\n\nTo get started, let's look at Anselm's argument. He thinks you can find proof of God by looking within yourself. He claims that because we can imagine God, we can't imagine that he doesn't exist. His idea is hard to put into words, but basically, he says that proof for God is already inside our minds. He thinks we don't need to look outside ourselves for the truth about God; we just need to think about what we already know is true. This idea of trusting in something without concrete evidence is, in Christian texts, called faith.\n\nAnselm's idea is different from Aquinas's. Aquinas thinks you can prove the existence of God using logic and facts, without needing any faith. This would be helpful in spreading Christianity, because new followers wouldn't need to accept something they can't prove. They could be convinced by logic alone. Aquinas uses five different logical arguments to prove God's existence: change, causation, being in a state of uncertainty, degrees of excellence, and how things fit together. In each one, he's saying that God must exist because it makes sense logically. Imagine you're trying to complete a puzzle, and someone tells you that you're missing one piece. You can figure out what the missing piece looks like just by looking at the rest of the puzzle.",
            "So, I'm learning about ancient times – like, a really long time ago, over 2,500 years ago. It was around the fifth or sixth century BCE, and a dude who would eventually be called Buddha was born. This guy renounced the world, became enlightened, and started teaching his ideas, which eventually led to the creation of Buddhism, specifically the Theravada branch. If you think back to when Buddha was alive, it was definitely different from how it is now. For instance, Sri Lanka has this super old tradition where they celebrate this water-cutting ceremony, but Buddha never actually taught about anything like that. It's pretty cool how the religion has changed over time – not just some superficial stuff, but also the core ideas that Buddhism is built on.\n\nThere are some important terms that I'll be using a lot in this discussion. When I say internal, I mean something that's inside the Buddhist community – like, it's not from outsiders, but from people who are actually a part of it. External means something that's coming from outside the community. Hostile means it's trying to hurt the community, even if it's not necessarily a bad thing. And benign means it's not trying to harm or help the community, even if it accidentally does one or the other. These terms will show up a lot.\n\nFirst off, I need to break down the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in this thing called the Triple Gem – it's like the Buddha, the teachings (Dhamma), and the community (Sangha). The Dhamma is basically the Buddhist texts, which are divided into three groups. The Sutta Pitaka has the sayings of Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper stuff about the meaning of life, like no soul (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and how everything is temporary (Anicca). If you understand these ideas, you can stop going through this cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara), and you can also get rid of desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha). The Vinaya Pitaka also gives rules for monks and laypeople, like the five precepts (no killing, lying, stealing, misbehaving, or getting drunk). Monks have way more rules to follow. One of the most important ideas in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico are like two countries that used to hate each other for a super long time - 57 whole years (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The worst part of their rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 when the US basically defeated Mexico and took Texas and the American Southwest (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). They had a bunch of other clashes too, but it all finally settled down just before World War I. I guess it's like what happens when two neighbors can't agree on stuff. It's the same with lots of countries who have a border with another country - they often disagree on big things like money, culture, and stuff (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nIt's not like the US and Mexico are the only ones with a long-standing rivalry - lots of countries with a shared border have similar problems. David M. Pletcher (1977) said that Mexico and Cuba are the only countries where the US has super long-standing diplomatic issues (p. 41). I guess it's because they're close to the US and have been at odds with it for a while. Other countries in Latin America have gotten along pretty well with the US.\n\nIt turns out that the US and Mexico didn't get along because of some pretty deep-seated issues - it's like they had a major disagreement about what to believe in. Sally Frahm (2001) said that back in the day, Americans were super opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). It's kinda like how the US and the Soviet Union didn't get along during the Cold War - they had some big ideological differences. But with the US and Mexico, it was more about their different religions. This whole thing started because the US and Mexico inherited some bad feelings from their former colonial rulers (the English and Spanish).\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted 17 times when the US and Mexico disagreed over 57 years. Most of these disagreements were about border stuff, like when Mexican bandits would cross over into the US, or when American outlaws would cause trouble in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). It wasn't until the US and Mexico both started cracking down on their borders that things started to get better.\n\nSchmitt (1974) said that things started to calm down when Mexico realized it needed the US a lot more (p. 109), and the US stopped trying to expand its territory and started focusing on helping Mexico out financially (p. 110).",
            "It's been 15 years since an illness I never even knew existed suddenly turned my life upside down and left me disabled. I was 46 at the time, working as a nurse, and had chosen the profession to escape feelings of uncertainty from my childhood. I was constantly told, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" but that didn't live up to reality. As a result, I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and to be honest, I'm still struggling every day. What keeps me going is the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends - I'm not as strong as I thought I was when disaster struck. \n\nMy point is that no matter how prepared we think we are, life can still throw us curveballs. There are no guarantees, and when the going gets tough, people need each other's help. I agree that we should question our reliance on the government, but instead of building our own shelters, we should be learning to trust and support each other. The idea of rugged individualism that Conservatives talk about isn't entirely accurate - the pioneers who settled the West didn't do it alone; they relied on each other for survival. \n\nWhile being prepared is a good idea, it's just as essential to build relationships with the people around us. I've got my emergency kit ready, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and all the essentials, but I also know that having neighbors who care can make all the difference. If you have the resources, it's great to have a small farm and a wood stove, but what's most important is knowing the people who live next door.",
            "So, what drives organisms to evolve in the way they do? Are there any roadblocks or restrictions that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said it was like trying to put into mathematical terms even the simplest living things. Fast forward to now, and we're still scratching our heads - but, we've been using math to help us understand certain parts of mollusk shell development through both how they grow and how they evolved over time (think Raup and Stanley's work from 1981 as an example). Our project is all about using mathematical modeling of how Prunum develops over time and in its history, combined with some actual experiments, to figure out what's behind the direction and strength of evolutionary changes. We used X-rays of Prunum species to pick out some key stats that we could then use to model different possible and real shell shapes. These numbers got plugged into a computer program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995), and we used it to imagine what shell shapes could be possible. This stuff is being combined with other studies to get a better handle on what's going on in the history of this group of animals.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that's constantly moving through space over time - it's kind of like a journey that's 360 degrees long. The parts of the shell that twist around in a spiral pattern are called whorls, and they're all connected by a line that runs through the center of the shell, called the columella. The speed at which these whorls get bigger can vary, and each one is separated by a line called a suture. In most shells, the biggest whorl is the last one (that's the body whorl). The spire is all the whorls except the last one, and the tip of the spire is the apex, while the other end is the base. The animal pops out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways, like from the front, back, opening, or from the side that's opposite the opening. Usually, when we look at a shell, it's from the front, with the opening facing us and the pointy end pointing up.\n\nHere's a cool way to count the whorls: first, look at the shell from the front, then find where the first line between two whorls starts. Draw a line between them, and count the whorls from that line - you can even estimate to a quarter of a whorl if you need to.\n\nA shell can also be thought of like a bunch of openings that move through space and time as the animal builds its shell. You can actually track the path of the opening by looking at the center of each whorl's opening, and the horizontal and vertical distance from the center to the edge of the opening. This path can be shown on a graph or mathematically. Once we have the math formula, we can play around with different parameters and see how they affect how the mollusk builds its shell.",
            "I've been going over the facts about neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia, and it's been a real bummer to see that there hasn't been a lot of change in the past ten years.  They're doing okay with some of the Millennium Development Goals, like getting people clean water and a decent bathroom, but when it comes to how well they're doing on child and mom health stuff, they're way behind where they need to be to meet their goals by 2015.  There are a lot of reasons for this, which I'll get into below, and it's pretty clear that they need to beef up their health system instead of just focusing on one-off programs.\n\tFirst off, Indonesia has made some progress with getting more births where a trained health worker is present, but 72% still means that a lot of moms aren't getting the help they need if something goes wrong.  It's like, yeah, more people are getting this, but it's not like it's a guarantee they'll get the care they need.  Plus, the ones who are trained are often just traditional workers, like midwives, who can't handle emergencies.  You can bet that a lot of the deaths are because of things like bleeding during pregnancy, which is a big problem.  So, even though they're getting better at this one thing, there's still lots to work on.  Another area that's a concern is how many kids with diarrhea under five are actually getting help from a health pro, and it's pretty low across the whole country.  They also don't have much data on how well new moms are doing after they give birth, but it's clear that's an issue too.\n\tWhen it comes to C-sections, they're not happening often enough - only about 4% of births are C-sections.  But what's even more worrying is that the rate is way lower in rural areas, at only 2%.  This shows that people in the cities are getting way more access to healthcare than those in the sticks.  It's like they're leaving the poor people behind.  And it gets even worse when you look at how well people in different income groups are using healthcare services - there's a huge gap between the richest and poorest people, and it's almost like they can't afford it.  Clearly, people have to pay out of pocket for healthcare, which is a real problem. \n\tNow, when it comes to figuring out how to fix all this, the main question is whether Indonesia should focus on specific programs or fix the whole health system at once.  On the one hand, targeting one area of healthcare sounds good because it's like, hey, let's get this one thing done and be done with it.  But the problem is that when you put all your eggs in one basket, other areas suffer and people start working on that one thing instead of other important stuff.  Just look at what happened with HIV/AIDS funding - it totally took resources away from family planning.  Plus, having lots of programs going on at the same time just means you end up with a bunch of duplicated and uncoordinated services, which makes it harder to get things done.",
            "Victorian novels are super detailed and often focus on the aristocracy of that time period, but there are two novels that stand out for not following this pattern - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these novels have a mysterious vibe and a bit of the weird and unusual, which is pretty different from the norm for the Victorian era. This adds depth to the characters and lets us see into their thoughts and feelings. They're not just rich people, they're real people with their own problems and emotions.\n\nI was totally confused, like I was walking around with Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing, and I could hear what they were saying. When I snapped back to reality, I was talking to them, but I didn't know what was going on. Suddenly, loud noises and flashes of light hit me, and I felt like I was being pulled around by some invisible force. It was all a bit fuzzy, but I could feel this gnawing pain that wouldn't go away.\n\n In these two novels, mystery often shows up in dream sequences or dream-like moments, but it's used in different ways. In Oliver Twist, these strange happenings often reveal what's going on inside Oliver's head, what's bothering him, and what he knows about the world around him. When Oliver gets shot in chapter 28, it's like he's reliving it in a dream, as he tries to find help. The scene shows how little control Oliver had over the events unfolding around him, and how desperate he was, as shown through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, and all his senses are numb; he doesn't notice the force that's taking him away, and he feels his fear and pain all over again, but without the shock. This makes us wonder whose fault it is that Oliver's in this situation, since it's definitely not his own. This scene also implies that Oliver's giving up, like he's been broken by Fagin and is just accepting his fate, which affects his ability to make decisions. Otherwise, we'd expect him to try to take action, even if it's just to save himself.\n\nThe day passed by so quickly, like it was just a blur. I mean, it was gone as soon as it started, and then night came back around again - it was so long and silent, but also so short and fleeting.",
            "It's been a couple of years since I worked at an after-school program helping elementary students with their studies, but one kid in particular stuck in my mind. I was assigned to help a little boy named Adrian, who was really struggling with reading. I soon realized something was off; he could pronounce some of the letters perfectly, but others were a complete mystery. It was a weird situation, especially since he spoke perfect English - or so I thought, until I met his mom. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish, and I was struggling to communicate with her, my Spanish skills being pretty basic. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized Adrian was actually reading just fine, but he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. I'm not sure if this revelation made a big difference in his reading, but I hope he's doing okay now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not as straightforward as we think; even kids who speak perfect English can still struggle with reading. I'm sure everyone agrees that this is a problem, so what's the solution? For Adrian, the answer was simple: extra help with the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's much more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these things on their own will fix the problem. The key is to combine them all.\n\nFirst off, the dual language system is a great idea that benefits not just kids who speak Spanish at home, but all kids. Studies have shown that kids in two-way bilingual education programs perform better academically. There's a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we implemented these programs in every classroom, all kids would benefit. So, how do we make it happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unfair. But we could definitely have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our teachers and students.",
            "Most of us learn from a young age that there's something greater than ourselves out there, something that's hard to fully comprehend.  Some people go to church, temple, or find their own inner answers.  Many accept the faith passed down from our parents, while others reject it and think there's nothing beyond our own understanding.  We might start with one set of values, only to change our minds later and adopt another.  Whatever path we take, we're on a journey to figure out who we are through our own unique take on spirituality.  We're searching for a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness.\n\nMy dad told me his favorite bird was cardinals when I asked him.  We were sitting on the porch, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof while we smoked our cigarettes.  The rain pouring down was drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, like he was half thinking, half remembering something.  He'd lost weight and his clothes hung loose on him.  His hair had gotten thinner, too.  He kept staring at the rain, avoiding eye contact.  I felt scared, alone, and didn't know how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him without making it feel more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain during that June twilight.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had only prolonged his suffering; I couldn't figure out what the point of that was.  If there was a God, I wondered, had he stopped listening to me a long time ago?  I said no prayers that night, alone in the darkness. \n\nI didn't want to watch him die.  I didn't want to see my creator slip away.  I wanted to remember my dad for how he lived, not how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone else, better than his family.  I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him go.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is basically a contradiction in terms, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel - \"an oxymoron for 'Old-New'.\" The Gothic genre's been getting a bad rap, but it's also been praised for evoking the 'terrible sublime.' People have accused it of being shallow, but others have argued that it's actually pretty deep. The very first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, took elements from old romances and modern novels and mashed them together to create something entirely new. Walpole called it \"A Gothic Story\" and it was a game-changer in terms of literary expression. The Gothic genre is all about throwing back to medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time The Castle of Otranto came out, the word \"gothic\" was already being used to describe a bunch of different things - people, styles, and time periods. It was seen as outdated and unsophisticated compared to the modern world. But the combination of Gothic flair and the new way novels were written (giving readers a more personal look at the characters' psyches) is what's kept the Gothic genre around for so long and made it both old and new to readers.\n\nOne of the most important Gothic ideas in these novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, which involves training a proper knight, is both carried over and altered in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is a big deal for Gothic writers because it represents the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and they saw a lack of that ideal in their own society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the Gothic past gets idealized and romanticized (which hints at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic). Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of political turmoil and was worried about the future. He thought that the supposed morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in his own society. This idea is clear in characters like Frederic. When we meet him, he's already shown to embody many chivalric traits - he's a prince, he's been through tragedy, and he's supposed to have been killed by infidels. The image of the gallant and courteous knight is exaggerated, which brings the Gothic trope of excess into play.",
            "Supply chain management is like a crazy rollercoaster of goods moving from the customer's order to raw materials, production, and finally to the customer's hands. It all started back in 1982 when Keith Oliver, a super cool consultant, came up with the term supply chain management. He basically described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently. It's like a puzzle with six key pieces: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These six elements work together to give customers the best service ever.\n\nOkay, let's dive into the first piece of the puzzle: production. It's like the foundation of the whole supply chain thing. Production is where everything starts, and it's all about figuring out when, why, where, and how to produce the goods. Managers need to know what customers want, and they can find out by checking out the market. The market is like the ultimate indicator of what customers are looking for. Once they've analyzed the market and understand customer demand, they're ready to decide what products to produce, how many to make, and where to make them. They've got to consider customer satisfaction and demand, or it's gonna be a disaster.\n\nFor example, when I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, they had these super detailed booklets and processes for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. It was like a well-oiled machine, and it helped them work smoothly without any confusion. \n\nThe second key element is supply. It's all about making strategic decisions that determine what a company can do and who they can partner with. A company might have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers need to decide which division is best for each process, or they might outsource the work to other companies to save money and increase flexibility. The goal is to create velocity – providing quality, flexibility, and low costs all at the same time.",
            "There's a sign that reads 'Hitler is alive in Burma.' If you believe that, you're probably as clueless as I am. I just saw this chick from Juno standing on a street corner with a sign that said the same thing. I'm guessing she just got it from the bottom of a shoebox of crap ideas. Burma's like a country in Southeast Asia that's got a pretty bad government. They took over in 1962 and have been a bunch of tyrants ever since. There was this huge protest in 2007, it was like, the first big one in years. These Buddhist monks were at the front of it, and they all wore orange robes. It became known as 'The Saffron Revolution.' The government was all cool with the monks at first, but then things took a dark turn and it was like a war or something. The government was going after the monks, invading their monasteries, and arresting journalists. One Japanese dude got killed just for being there. I don't know the exact number of people who died, but some guy who used to be in the army said it's way more than they're saying.\n\nThis stuff's not new, though. Governments have been trying to shut down anyone who disagrees with them for as long as humans have been around. Like, the ancient Romans thought their rulers were gods. In Japan, the emperor is actually thought to be a god or whatever. And don't even get me started on George W. Bush's buddies with that dude from Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere are some pretty crazy examples of this stuff. Like that time in Tiananmen Square in 1989. It was like a huge protest against the Chinese government and they killed a bunch of people. The Chinese government says 200-300 died, but other people say it was way more like 2,000-3,000. Then there was the Rwandan genocide, where these Hutu militias were just killing Tutsis and anyone else they didn't like. And don't forget about Hitler's thing with the Jews. It's all pretty messed up.",
            "So, Duke Ellington's influence on jazz was pretty much due to his staying power and his ability to get his orchestra sounding just right. Most of the time, his piano parts in the songs picked for this assignment are pretty subtle, but as a composer, Ellington was a pro at creating super intricate and complex pieces that made each band member shine. He built the foundation for the band to improvise and also wrote super tight pieces that fit each person's style. This way, he made the entire orchestra sound really cool and unique for each song. Ellington was a master at figuring out how each player sounded and how they fit together, which allowed him to make some of the most awesome and groundbreaking jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Groove Music dictionary talks about how Ellington's sound and innovation are all about using voice as a jazz instrument, like in \"Creole Love Call.\" This was one of the first times he used voice to add some extra texture and tone without getting in the way of the lyrics. It's a slow, 12-bar blues piece with six parts, and it's really interesting to see how he plays with different styles. Here's what happens in each part:\n\nPart 1: It's all about call and response between the voice and the woodwinds, with the voice starting smooth and getting rough towards the end.\nPart 2: There's a muted trumpet solo that takes the basic melody and makes it sound even cooler with some long, blue notes.\nPart 3: The clarinet takes center stage with a super high and wild solo, and the piano is in the background with a subtle, syncopated beat.\nPart 4: The whole band echoes the first part with call and response, but this time it's the brass and woodwinds.\nPart 5: This is the climax, where the woodwinds start calling out in a high register and the brass and rhythm sections are all over the place.\nPart 6: It goes back to the first part, but this time the voice is growling like an instrument and soloing like crazy.\n\nIt's just one example of how Ellington used voice to add some serious tone color to his music. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he takes it to the next level by combining his skill at writing tight arrangements with his ear for tone color. He gets \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox on scat singing to create this super rich and complementary sound. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to make the melody on muted trombone sound super cool.",
            "There was this weird feeling inside of her that she just couldn't shake off. It started when she was 14 and had just begun to get into the whole teenage scene, and it was still going strong at 17. She was convinced it was something more than just a thing she needed, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what that 'something' was. Guys had tried to catch her attention, but none of them did. She often wondered why on earth she felt like this. She'd thought about it so much over the years that she'd come up with some pretty wild theories, but nothing that made total sense. So she just went with it, constantly questioning her own desires.\n\nAt home, things were usually chill. Her parents were pretty laid back and never fought with each other. They rarely even got into it with her, and when they did, it was just because she was being a bit too independent. She was the total opposite of her parents, super energetic and fun. People loved her for it. But today, things were different.\n\nAs she walked from room to room looking for some inspiration, she heard a loud scream from the kitchen and her heart started racing. She rushed in to find her mom on the ground, looking really hurt. Her mom was saying 'ow' over and over and her daughter freaked out. \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" She quickly ran to her mom's side and helped her up, trying to be brave. \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mom's words were all jumbled and rushed, and her daughter could tell she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay, Mom, where do I pick you up?\" Her mom pointed and she was grateful she'd taken self-defense classes so she could help her out. She carried her mom to the car, got her settled in, and sped off.\n\nThe hospital was a whole different story - it was all sick smells and worried faces. Her brain wasn't really taking it in though, she was too focused on her mom. She got her to the hospital and called out for help, then just sat there waiting for the doctors to figure out what was going on. Someone wheeled her mom off to get checked out, and she was left sitting there, worried sick.\n\nApparently, her mom had tried to grab a vase from a super high cabinet and fallen off a stepping stool. Whoa. That was a pretty crazy thing to happen.",
            "This study checked if sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" - aka the \"Med diet\" - really helps cut the risk of getting heart disease and strokes and even dying from them. We made a special version of the Med diet called \"alternate Mediterranean diet\" (aMed) that's a bit different from the original. It's all about eating a lot of plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans (but not potatoes), plus some fish, and less of the fatty stuff from animals. You can even have a little bit of booze if you want.\n\nMost research about the Med diet has shown that following it can be good for you, but this time we were looking at how it affects stroke and stroke deaths. Previous studies said that people who ate a Med diet were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart problems, and even lost weight better than those who ate a low-fat diet. But nobody checked if it also helps with strokes.\n\nWe looked at 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old who weren't sick with heart problems or diabetes. They're all part of a huge study of nurses in 11 US states. Every year from 1984 to 2004, we asked them about their eating habits through these questionnaires, and we used a special score to see how well they followed the aMed diet. Most of the nurses kept participating for the whole 20 years, and we checked the accuracy of their answers by looking at their medical records. When we didn't have those records, we made an educated guess, which was right about 17% of the time for strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nWe also looked at things like their weight, if they smoked, if they took aspirin or multivitamins, and how much exercise they got. To make sure our results were accurate, we averaged the women's aMed scores over 2 years instead of looking at one year at a time. We also took into account things that could mess with our results, like age, smoking, weight, and stuff like that.\n\nUsing a special math tool, we found out that eating more like the Mediterranean diet helped lower the risk of heart disease and strokes in these women. Out of all the women we checked, 2391 had a heart attack, 1763 had a stroke, and 1077 died from either of those things. Women who ate the most like the aMed diet were less likely to get heart disease or a stroke than those who didn't eat like that at all (their risk was 71% lower).",
            "Back in 2007, the United States was hit with this super harsh financial crisis. People were losing their jobs, the housing market tanked, and all these big, super-important companies were basically left for dead. And guess what? We're still dealing with the aftermath, so we're all like, \"Dude, how did this happen and how can we prevent it from happening again?\" So, in a nutshell, the financial crisis was basically caused by some pretty selfish and clueless political decisions that made banks and firms give out all these sketchy loans to people who weren't exactly in a good financial spot. Meanwhile, these huge companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were like, \"Hey, we gotta help out these people by buying and re-selling these mortgages,\" but they were all based on shaky ground. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were all, \"Oh no, we're low on cash,\" and then they passed the chaos onto the next guy, and the next guy, and the next guy in line.\n\nBut the roots of this financial mess go way back to 1999 when the Clinton administration was all, \"Hey, I want to get re-elected, so let's relax some of the lending rules and see what happens.\" And, well, it didn't exactly turn out as planned. Steven Holmes from the New York Times was all, \"Uh-oh, we're gonna have a problem if we keep doing this,\" and he even predicted the whole thing would end in a massive bailout. And, guess what? He was totally right. It was like a domino effect, where all these fancy new mortgage things like adjustable-rate mortgages and collateralized debt obligations just tied everything together, making the whole economy super vulnerable to even the smallest change.\n\nIt's like, a whole bunch of factors came together to make the economy freak out. People were taking on way too much debt and getting all caught up in the housing market, making them super susceptible to even tiny changes in prices. And then, BAM! The housing bubble bursts and all these banks that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities are all, \"Uh-oh, we're toast!\" The top five investment banks had over $4 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which is like, a huge chunk of the country's GDP. In the end, some banks were sold for peanuts, others were dismantled, and some were forced to become super-regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie were like, \"Whoops, we're in trouble,\" and the government had to step in to take control of them in 2008.",
            "You know, the big reveal – that part in your story where you spread your wings and take to the skies with your writing, leaving everyone in awe. Or, on the other hand, your readers zone out and hit the back button as they silently curse your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to frantically yell at her monitor when she finds herself stuck in a sea of unnecessary details, and it's never the fun kind.\n\nExposition – that pesky part of your story where you lay out the groundwork, but end up bogging down the whole thing.  Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin tend to stumble into lengthy descriptions that amount to nothing, or worse, are just too much.\n\nWe've all heard the advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" but the truth is, Dr. Merlin still manages to get sucked into info dumps that leave readers yawning.  Exposition is that annoying voice in the back of your head telling you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff – not to be confused with that other pesky voice urging you to share every single detail about each character's childhood.\n\nIn a nutshell, exposition is when you're told about what happened, and it's usually just plain old telling.  In film, it's that one character that launches into a lengthy, tedious monologue, while in fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.  You're reading a story and you're told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they got hitched in a fancy ceremony, and that her husband was brutally murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to drag on for two whole pages, with both of them only getting two lines of dialogue each.  No, you'd expect the author to take their time to develop the husband's character, to show through his words and actions how deeply he adored his wife.  You'd also expect the heroine to reveal her feelings through her reactions and actions, especially if the story later on tells you that this was the case.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and give you insight into the heroine's character, showing what she saw in him, how strong their bond was, and what clues about her thoughts and dreams she reflected from his perspective.  You'd feel her pain when he died and become more connected to her as a result.\n\nIn essence, you'd want substance to back up the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  As a writer, it's your job to provide that meat.\n\nSometimes it's tempting to rush through certain parts, like introducing a new character and dumping a bunch of unnecessary details about their past.  Perhaps you know he used to be in the Air Force, he's the night manager of a gas station now, he's been married twice, has no kids, loves fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.  Don't do it.  Provide your readers with something more.",
            "Today I caught up on the news from Columbus, Ohio. I watched two newscasts, the first one being NBC 4 this morning on August 13, 2011. Their lead story was about a disturbing incident where a man named Shad Hostettler stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. I noticed they only spent about two minutes on it, which seemed like the right amount of time to me since it was a developing story. The only details they shared were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was already under arrest. I also saw his mug shot and thought he looked pretty sinister.\n \nThe next story was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers who got shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was in critical condition, and the police were still searching for the shooter, but no arrests had been made yet. This story seemed really short, and I'm guessing it might have been because the victim was black and from a black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that minorities get glossed over when they're victims of a crime, and it's like the media doesn't care about them as much. I mean, if a white person was in the same situation, the media would be all over it.\n \nThe news also covered a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They talked about where they think the incident happened and said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. The police are offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n \nNext up was a story about the weather forecast for Saturday, with rain and thunderstorms predicted for the afternoon. They said the temperature would stay in the mid to low eighties all weekend. I thought they kept it a bit too short, but they probably wanted to leave it as a teaser to keep viewers tuning in.\n \nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The robber was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, and they made a big deal about how dark he was. I thought it was weird they spent so much time emphasizing that.\n \nAnother story was about a guy named Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was that they said he got sentenced to 300 months in prison instead of 25 years. I don't know if they thought that sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he's Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's this thing with brothers, you know? It's like, this super strong bond that's untouchable. Inside that bond, all these emotions are swirling around: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers somehow just get each other, in a way that no one else does, and when they look at each other, they're basically staring at themselves. It's when things get really tough that the true nature of that bond comes out, whether it's good or bad. When those feelings become super clear, they come with a big price to pay. Part of understanding this stuff is dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you can look a brother in the eye and see a part of yourself staring back, you see who you really are, not how others see you. Your true character is in the stuff you do and what happens because of it. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this whole brother thing, with all the crazy emotions that come with it. The story's set in this really vivid world, and these two guys go on this doomed journey. Bitter sadness clashes with intense pride in the crazy final scene, and only one of them gets out alive. The theme is all over the place, but it's mainly about the main character, Doodle, and his bro's interactions, as well as the narrator's point of view, which shows all the complicated feelings Doodle's got going on. \n\nDoodle's main thing is pride. From the beginning, when they first go out together, to their last, super intense trip, Doodle's all resentful towards his little bro, Doodle. He wanted a bro who'd be all into the same stuff as him, like learning how to hold his breath or climb trees. He wanted someone to hang out with in Horsehead Landing or sit with in the top fork of that big pine tree behind the barn. But that's just not possible with Doodle, 'cause he's got a weak heart and can't do all the cool stuff. The young Doodle had these huge dreams, and they get totally crushed when he realizes it's never gonna happen. He even thinks about killing Doodle, which is just wild, but then Doodle smiles at him, and suddenly he's all warm inside. That shows you that his feelings aren't as strong as he thought. Even though he's got some anger towards Doodle, deep down he loves the little guy.",
            "The human brain is a super cool, super complex thinking machine that's been around for ages. Over time, people's ideas about how it works have evolved along with technology - it used to be thought to be like a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and nowadays it's like a super-duper computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons aren't perfect and can sometimes lead to some pretty weird conclusions.\nFirst off, the brain takes in information from your senses - like touch, heat, sounds, or light - and turns it into a bunch of electrical signals. As this info gets processed in the brain, it gets transformed again and again in both top-down and bottom-up ways. For instance, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together tiny pieces of information like color, direction, and borders to figure out that you're looking at a box. Then, the brain uses the decisions it made earlier to speed up your recognition of the box, kinda like a shortcut.\nAfter a while, the brain decides which signals are important and which ones should be ignored. For example, even though your brain is processing every single blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, your brain's \"selective attention\" filter helps you tune it out. On the other hand, if someone yells out your name in a noisy room, you'd probably pick up on that way faster. There are lots of stages to this process, and the brain's attention filter is like a button that gets pressed again and again to decide what's important.\nFor the brain to process information, it needs to be stored somewhere. There are different kinds of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain encodes the information - there are special ways to do this depending on what kind of info it is. For example, words can be encoded based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean. Once the info is stored, the brain needs to keep it safe. Some studies on animals suggest that working memory, which lasts for about 20 seconds, is like a temporary electrical signal that zaps through a certain group of brain cells. Information in long-term memory, on the other hand, might be stored in the shape of certain special proteins.\nThere are tons of theories about how the brain organizes knowledge, ranging from how people remember things, to computer science ideas, to what happens in the brain itself. One popular idea is the semantic network model, which says that there are special nodes in the brain for concepts, and that they're connected to each other based on how they're related. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns of the dangers of a future where technology and capitalism are deeply intertwined in his novel Brave New World. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned to prioritize immediate happiness above all else. It's like they're trapped in a never-ending cycle, forced to conform to a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals his concerns about the emerging systems of his time. Terms like homogeny and reification, commonly used in Marxism, suggest that the novel is a commentary on the negative effects of these systems. \n\nCapitalism is also heavily criticized in Brave New World, particularly through the concept of false consciousness. Essentially, the general population is kept in the dark about their true relationship with other classes, and they're only concerned with their own gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of people, especially the lower classes like Delta and Gamma, who are made to crave consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this desire, making it seem like it's their own idea. The lower classes are essentially brainwashed into accepting their place in society, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are either unaware of the manipulation or choose to ignore it. The way the social classes interact with each other is a clear indication of the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and lack depth. The characters are one-dimensional, and even the main characters are often portrayed as lacking any real emotions or connections. This could be seen as Huxley's way of saying that the rise of technology and capitalism is stripping people of their free will and individuality. Love and strong emotions are non-existent, and people are only concerned with superficial interactions, like commenting on physical appearance. The fact that each class is content with their place in the hierarchy and follows the rules without question is a reflection of Marxist ideas about the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and obey.",
            "So, I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now, which is four and a half semesters, I guess. For a lot of us, getting around campus can be super tough. My freshman year I lived in an East Halls dorm room; basically as far east as you can get without counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It took me up to 25 minutes to get to classes in the Willard building, which is pretty central, especially when it's all yucky outside, like it often is in State College. I talked to an alum not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were totally separate from the rest of the school, with huge chunks of empty land in between. Nowadays, that space is filled with sports fields, brand new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this mobility problem? On a college campus, it's gotta be the bike. But just having a bike isn't enough - students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be made bike-friendly.\n\nI was talking to my friend who recently started biking again after a long break, and he said, \"Bikes are awesome.\" He told me, \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's literally the best way to get around.\" Not only is it good for your body, but it's also super efficient. Eating a bowl of oatmeal and doing a little exercise can get you 30 miles or more. Like many of us, I'm living off campus now, and it's just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I've done this year was buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with my bike, I can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is, Pollock Road is the straightest route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always easy, no matter if you're biking or not. There are some good things to say about walking too, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up way too much of my time. Walking to Thomas every day would be an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. Add all the other time I'd have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm planning on pursuing an education in social work with the ultimate goal of joining the Division of Family and Children Services to help kids who've been through abuse or neglect, as well as offer support to troubled families. When it comes to social work, I'm all about bringing the following core values to the table: service, respect, an honest approach, and dedication to making relationships between people better, along with constantly working on myself to stay sharp in my field. These values aren't just important for social workers; they're super important to me personally.\n\nI've always had a desire to help others, but I wasn't sure what career path I wanted to take. Throughout high school and college, I saw a lot of people trying to run away from their problems instead of facing them, and some turned to not-so-great coping mechanisms. Because of what I've seen, I decided to major in Psychology. Still unsure about my career path, I took a break after I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old who was really nervous because he was staying with her – he was trying to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I found out that he'd called the police to their house. I went over to their place and talked to the police about my concerns, explaining that I'd just graduated from Piedmont College with a degree in Psychology. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I questioned them, they seemed really nervous and made excuses for their son's behavior, saying he was just trying to get people involved in \"simple\" family disputes. That experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to help kids deal with similar problems.\n\nI'm also really passionate about social justice. Society says that the individual is important, but we end up trying to be like everyone else instead of embracing our uniqueness. I'm all about being an individual and not limiting myself to what others think I should be. Throughout high school and college, I protested against social injustice in any way I could: I'd dye my hair weird colors, wear clothes that fit my style, get piercings that went against the norm, and speak out against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep speaking out against it.",
            "This paper explores the connection between the Biological and Sociocultural models and insomnia. The Biological model focuses on the genetic information passed down from our parents and medical aspects, while the Sociocultural model looks at the impact of environment on sleep, including things like where you live, your race, ethnicity, and income level. To understand these models, we'll look at various studies that relate to them and use them to explain each one better. We'll also critique the research to point out its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be broken down into three categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders that are connected to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical problems or substances. The primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias, which are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and Parasomnias, which are sleep disorders that cause weird behaviors or physical things to happen while you're asleep. The Dyssonmias include Primary Insomnia, where you can't fall asleep or stay asleep, Primary Hypersomnia, where you can't stay awake, Narcolepsy, which involves extreme sleepiness and hallucinations, and a few others. The Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe sleep disorders connected to other mental health issues are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders. The Biological and Sociocultural models are especially useful for understanding the primary sleep disorders. Research on the Biological model has found that the hypothalamus in our brain has special cells that control our sleep-wake cycle. Scientists have done studies with mice and found that these cells have something called orexin, which helps us stay awake or fall asleep. They've also found that a receptor called GABAB is responsible for sleep and wakefulness. When this receptor is activated, it helps us fall asleep, and when it's not working right, it can cause problems with sleep. A study using a special medication called baclofen found that it can help people sleep better by activating the GABAB receptor. This shows that there's a link between our genes and our ability to sleep. This has sociocultural implications, because if we inherit a problem with the GABAB receptor, it could affect our sleep and make it hard for us to focus on everyday tasks.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), which is a pretty complex topic. So, to start, let's break it down: CAPD is basically how well the brain uses the sounds it hears. It's a weird way to put it, but essentially, the brain can't process what we hear in a normal way. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but it's like their brain's sound-decoding skills are a bit wonky. It's not about not being able to hear, it's about how the brain takes what we hear and turns it into something that makes sense.\n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first started noticing that some kids with speech problems had trouble processing sounds. A team of Italian researchers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, started working on tests for these kids in 1954, and in 1961, a researcher named Kimura came up with a way to understand how the brain handles sounds. This all led to a big conference in 1977 that got more people interested in studying CAPD.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of different ways: someone with CAPD might have trouble pinpointing where sounds are coming from, or might get confused when there are multiple sounds happening at once. They might also struggle to recognize patterns in sounds, or tell when someone's being sarcastic, or block out one sound if another sound comes after it. It's like their brain's sound-sorting system is a bit messed up. They might also have trouble making sense of sounds in a way that they can use them in real life, or figuring out the order of sounds.\n\nSo, to figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors and specialists use a bunch of different tests to see how they respond to sounds. This can include watching how they behave when they're listening, or asking them questions and seeing how they react. There's no single test that's super reliable, and nobody really knows what causes CAPD. The tests usually involve playing a bunch of sounds at the same time and asking the person to pick out specific ones, or recording the sounds in their ear and seeing how their brain responds.",
            "Twelfth Night makes it clear that even though pretending to be someone else can get you out of a tight spot, eventually you're going to have to stop or risk losing yourself forever. The problem with giving up the act is that you might end up all alone, cut off from the people around you. It's a tough choice - do you take care of yourself or do you take care of the people you care about? Some people might not even get mad if they figure out you've been lying, but others will definitely be super ticked off.\n\nThe whole idea of dressing up as the opposite sex gets even more complicated because it makes you wonder why anyone would want to change who they are in the first place. Like, why would Viola pretend to be a guy to protect herself from bad people? She says, \"I'll meet a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) She has to pretend to be a guy because she's in a new place and doesn't want to get hurt. But by doing that, she ends up losing her support system and even makes people think she's a different person, like Sebastian. Olivia totally falls for her, and Viola also has to deal with some weird feelings for Orsino. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) It's all pretty weird.\n\nSome people might see Twelfth Night as a way to explore how pretending to be someone else can help you figure out your true feelings. Like, Olivia and Orsino might be hiding something, and Viola's disguise is like a wake-up call for them. The way they react to Viola makes you wonder if they were really attracted to her as a guy or if they were just freaked out by their own feelings. It's like Shakespeare is poking fun at people who judge others based on how they look. Olivia is totally shallow, because she goes from loving Cesario to loving Sebastian without even a second thought, and then just thinks of Viola as a sister. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial empire was known for its brutality, especially in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing it as just that doesn't do it justice. The empire was all over the map in terms of policies and ruling styles, like its geography. Different colonies had different approaches to education too. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that the locals were already pretty educated and literate. German education efforts in Kamerun and other colonies got some positive reviews from the time.\n\nBut German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was a whole different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government set up schools and was really involved in teaching the locals, they pretty much left education to missionary groups who didn't get a lot of support from the government. The government did invest in educating Europeans living there, though - they set up their own schools and really helped out the missionary schools. These decisions had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population was basically uneducated and illiterate. It's not like one single thing caused this difference, though - it was a bunch of social, political, and economic factors that made South West Africa's experience unique.\n\nThere's actually a lot of research out there about education in the German colonies, but most of it is in German and was written a long time ago. Early studies were mainly just describing the educational systems in each colony. Later studies in English did some cool comparisons between different colonies and really dug deep into the details. One of the most important studies on this topic is Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen looked at how the two colonies were similar and different and figured out some of the reasons behind those differences. According to Cohen, the fact that there were so many settlers in South West Africa explains a lot about the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a pretty good climate, considering it's mostly desert, so there were a lot of Europeans living there by 1913 - almost 15,000, which is way more than in East Africa. The settlers in South West Africa were actually pretty lucky to be living in a place with a relatively nice climate.",
            "Heavy Metal music has evolved a ton over the past century, and it's hard to even try to list all the genres. To make things even more complicated, most of these genres have spawned sub and sub-sub genres. It's crazy to think about how far it's come, especially considering that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. This is because it shows a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean towards the darker side. People started to realize that Heavy Metal had real flexibility and took advantage of it to create their own sub-genre, followed by sub-sub-genres, and it just keeps going.\n\nNowadays, we're at a point where there are so many niches of groups that it's hard to figure out what Heavy Metal even is. It's incorporated so many themes from other genres, but it all started somewhere. To understand the Metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta know what the Metal movement is and why it's a movement, not just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is basically a movement defined by darkness. It's like, more of everything - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatrics. It's way less about being raw and basic; in Metal bands, people are super skilled at playing their instruments, and that comes through in the music. Plus, Metal is a movement that's super influenced by drugs - the psychedelic boom in the '70s got people pretty wild, and that's when some of the craziest, otherworldly records started coming out. It's got all these dark, visceral qualities that were new to the music scene because most popular music was all about being happy and light. Later generations of Metal took some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Some lyrics, like these from Helter Skelter, show just how dark Metal can get. It's like the Beatles' darker side, all about ups and downs, kinda like being on drugs. Some people even consider this song to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs ever. It was a response to the Rolling Stones, who were also getting darker and heavier with their music. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "It's pretty cool to think that before the Surrealists were making their dreamy art, Henri Rousseau was actually living his own dream, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a painting he made in 1910, shows a woman who's in awe of the cool stuff she's seeing in her dreamland, but it also represents Rousseau's own goals as an artist. He had been hoping to get recognized by other artists and art lovers for a long time, but he was stuck with a weird problem: should he try to fit in with the art world by copying other artists, or be true to himself and do his own thing? The Dream is like his masterpiece that shows how he struggled with this for his whole career – wanting to be accepted by the art world he loved, but also wanting to be different and make his own unique art.\n\nTo really get what The Dream is all about, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His dad was a tinsmith who was pretty successful, but Rousseau never got any formal art training – he just worked a regular job until he was 40. People even started calling him a customs inspector, but that's not what he really did (Shattuck 46). When his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their babies, Rousseau was left with a ton of grief and a young daughter, Julia. He started painting to help him deal with the pain and move on. Unlike some other artists of his time, Rousseau wasn't all about painting the perfect peasant scene – he was just a regular guy with regular hopes and dreams.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Rousseau wanted to fit in with the art world – he was starting from scratch, and he was working with some really talented artists who were already famous. He didn't get recognized until around the same time that Matisse was making a name for himself. As author Jan Gordon pointed out in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were different in a lot of ways – not just in their art style, but also why they made art in the first place. While Matisse was all about not being boring, Rousseau just wanted to make art that was good enough to get him into the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "You know, people have been saying for ages that there's a deep connection between how we think about right and wrong, and how we think about what's beautiful and what's not. I'm convinced that there's a reason for this. As John Keats so wisely put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we learn in life comes from school or through our experiences, but somehow, we naturally know what's beautiful and what's the right thing to do, even if no one taught us. Both ethics and aesthetics are all about explaining why something is beautiful or right, rather than telling us how to decide what's good art or good behavior. \n\nIn other words, when we talk about why we like a particular painting, or why we think a certain action is the right thing to do, we can't really put our finger on it. A conversation about the Mona Lisa might go on and on about its lighting or the culture behind it, but ultimately, that doesn't capture what makes it so great. When someone asks you about your favorite book or piece of art, you often end up saying \"There's just something about it\" before trying to come up with a more thoughtful explanation. I think that both art and morality have this quality to them - they can't be fully explained by just listing their good qualities. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Even if we try to describe a book in detail, there's something more to it that we can't quite put into words. I think that this is true for ethics too - as Ludwig Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think that this \"something\" - this intangible quality - is what makes art and morality so powerful, and that it's what connects them.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are closely related because we experience them in a way that's hard to explain. They affect us on a deep level, but we can't quite put into words. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature - as McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are not as relevant to other arts, like music, but they seem to be just as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's got this amazing vibe going on right now, it's like a super strong country with its own unique culture that you can feel all the way from the Alps in München down to the Baltic sea city of Kiel.  You can sense it in Köln on the Rhine, in the middle of the country, and even in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany's culture is a mix of different sources and tribes, considering how it all came together. \n\nGermania is basically the ancestral land of the Germans, but where the name actually came from is still up for debate among scholars. Some think it's from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, or even from a previous name for the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. Julius Caesar was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he took it from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between the ones he'd conquered and the ones he hadn't. He wrote in his first book, \"Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, are always at war with the Gauls. They fight the Germans almost every day.\" Others believe it might mean \"spear\" from the Old English word ger, or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, which means \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were super loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" around AD 98 that the Germans were aboriginal and not mixed with other races. He said, \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, let alone Germany, with its harsh climate, gloomy skies, and sullen people?\" It's pretty obvious the Romans wouldn't be interested in moving there, at least not yet. They'd send out their conquests to Germania to trade and occasionally lead a land campaign, but they'd mostly stay in their empire. The Germanic tribes started showing up around the first century, living on the Roman Empire's borders, trading their goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood there staring blankly at the scene before me, my mind a complete blank slate.  I just couldn't seem to grasp anything about it, like it was just a bunch of random stuff I was looking at.  My thoughts were zipping in and out of my brain too fast for me to catch them.  I was like a total robot, just processing the image without really thinking about it.\n\nI had been wanting to learn how to draw for ages, ever since I was six.  Then I got this art book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and it totally changed everything.  It teaches you all these crazy cool techniques like how to break down a picture into simple shapes and stuff.  One trick it shows you is to frame a picture with a square, which makes it way easier to draw.  But at that moment, I was so overwhelmed by the whole thing that I just couldn't even think about framing it.  I was stuck, just staring at the picture in awe.\n\nI've always been fascinated by artists who create masterpieces with crazy styles, like Picasso with his blue phase or Monet with his greenery.  If I wanted to be an artist, I figured this was my chance to make something special – I'd call it Work in Brown.  I picked up my pencil, my hand started moving, and for a second, I felt like I was totally in the zone.  But then I had to go and mess it up by trying to, ahem, take care of a little business...  My hand smacked the toilet handle, but the, um, 'present' refused to budge.  I was stuck staring at this gross brown package that someone had left behind.  I grabbed the mop, frowning, trying to get my mind off the situation.  A few more flushes, a few more minutes of me standing there, then I finally managed to get my hand into the toilet and...well, let's just say it was a real challenge.",
            "Teenage drivers are dying behind the wheel in alarming numbers.  Several factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  According to the National Institutes of Health, a big part of the problem is that the teen brain just isn't ready for the risks of driving.  Inexperience is another major factor – it not only causes more fatal accidents, but also increases the rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  And, as anyone can guess, teens often drive with their friends – which is a deadly combo.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the more underage passengers, the higher the risk of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and some other states have tried to make teens safer by requiring temporary licenses that limit their driving hours and ban other minors as passengers.  But these provisional licenses are just a temporary fix.  The real issue is that, as a group, teen drivers are just not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Researcher Marvin Zuckerman thinks that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, and he's got the stats to back it up.  A common trait among teens is the desire to take risks for the thrill of it, so it makes sense to delay driving until they're a bit older.  If we keep giving out driver's licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing deadly accidents happen, and the death toll will skyrocket in the next few years.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will hit the road, and the situation could get even more serious.\n\nLegislation to deal with this issue would be pretty straightforward.  Schools could still teach driver's education classes to get future drivers started, but no one under 18 could drive.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license, and a certain number of driving hours would still be required.  The number of hours could be based on the number already required in most states (in California, for example, that's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with a grown-up).  Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea's not new, but it's still worth considering.",
            "So I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's film collection and decided to check out the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were a total of 15 of these films, and I watched them all. Trick films use creative editing to create illusions, so I focused on analyzing the style and evolution of these early films. Most of them are pretty straightforward - they're set-bound, shot in a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and stick to the one shot equals one film rule. However, some of the later films broke free from these rules by introducing new ideas like multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was how all the trick films share the same set-up: they're all shot on a static set within a frontal proscenium. The camera stays in one place and doesn't follow the action. This style came from the theatre and, for trick films, the magic shows and vaudeville acts of the time. A big limitation of this style is that the actors can only move side-to-side, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Check out Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) for an example - the actors enter from the right and just bop back and forth across the screen.\n\nThese films also tend to use a lot of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. They never use close-ups, just like in the theatre and vaudeville days when the whole performance would be visible on stage. The actors stay in the middle ground and don't move towards the camera, so the audience never gets a close-up shot. Most of these early trick films are pretty short, lasting only a minute or so, because they follow the rule of one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits what they can do, so most of them are just simple tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, look closer at a film like The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) and you'll see that the physical shot and the conceptual shot aren't always the same thing - sometimes a single shot is made up of multiple physical shots to create an illusion.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was super into the idea of Republicanism and was always speaking his mind about personal freedom and government. As a farmer, his job and his short stint in politics made him known for being outspoken and dedicated. His love for the country life influenced just about all his thoughts on government, especially when it came to how a system should work. He thought that preserving and supporting agriculture was the key to making good arguments about things like power, rules, and the courts.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to create the perfect system because nobody was stuck in the past and telling them what to do. This meant that they could make a system where people had control over themselves. He was all about the natural rights of people, and he thought that they're all connected - if one of them gets taken away, the others get hurt too, and they're not as valuable. He thought that these rights should be off-limits to the government. He said that the \"state of nature\" was basically a world where the strong and mean people get ahead, but in a civilized society, that's not how it should be.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought that the government had to be created so that it accounted for both the good and bad in people. He was super strict about his ideas on right and wrong being two separate things. He said that since governments are run by people, they'll have all the good and bad qualities that come with being human. He thought that good principles were about protecting private property, helping farmers, and keeping capitalism in check. He believed that a government with good principles would work fairly no matter who was in charge, even if they were mostly looking out for themselves. He thought that people are self-centered, but that's not always a bad thing - it's only bad when it hurts others. A good government was needed to keep people's bad qualities in check, and it had to be watched closely to make sure it didn't add any bad principles.\n\nLike many other strong Republicans back then, Taylor wanted the government to stick to the Constitution and not do anything that wasn't clearly said in it. He thought that a big government was expensive and likely to be super controlling. However, he also thought that just following the words without thinking about what the writers meant could be really bad. He even thought that the Declaration of Independence was like the true guide for the United States because it made it clear that we're a group of states, not one single country.",
            "Going back to the data in Figure 17, we saw a drastic drop in commuter log entries during the third month of the project. That was pretty discouraging, and it wasn't easy to figure out why it happened. Winter was in full swing at our New England campus, which probably contributed to the decline in bicycle and foot traffic. Also, December signals the end of the fall semester, so people were busy wrapping up schoolwork and finals, and the commuter log might have slipped their minds. To make things worse, it's the start of the holiday season, and students and faculty get a month-long break, which means many people didn't even need to come to campus. As for January, classes resumed in late January, but I'm not sure if that's related to the low log submissions for that month. What really puzzles me, though, is why the submissions remained low in February. Maybe it's just the natural life cycle of a project - everyone gets excited at first, and then things die down. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special push to reinvigorate the project, which did lead to a surge in log submissions that month. So, we faced the tough challenge of keeping the project going despite a natural dip in interest, compounded by the semester and holiday breaks that come with higher education.\n\nAnother hurdle we faced (and any commuting project will, I guess) is that people really love their freedom, independence, and the flexibility of driving. It's a deep-seated part of our culture. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we needed to offer some serious incentives. We gave out gift cards to local spots, but it would have been cool to see how bigger prizes, like a new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car, would have affected participation. That might have helped us combat that initial dip in engagement. The prizes we offered didn't change, though - if we had announced some bigger prizes, like a bike in December and a car in January, I bet it would have made a difference.",
            "I just learned about Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs for short, and they're pretty cool.  They're like index funds but way more flexible and you can buy and sell them like stocks.  You get the good stuff about index funds like diversification, but you also get the benefits of owning individual stocks, like being able to short sell and buy on margin.  Plus, you can buy just one share, which is pretty sweet.  But the best part is that ETFs are way cheaper than the average mutual fund.  The only downside is that you have to pay a commission when you trade them, just like with stocks.  There are tons of different ETFs out there, so it's up to you to figure out which ones are the best.  In this case, we're looking at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning just those stocks is better than owning the whole ETF.  We're only looking at the top 10 because it would be crazy to try to analyze every single holding.  These 10 stocks make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets, so it's a good representation.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the whole ETF, we're going to use some math to calculate their Beta and Return.  If we had a portfolio made up of just these 10 stocks, how would it compare to the whole ETF?  The chart shows that if we just owned the top 10 stocks, our portfolio would be 16% higher in returns and have a lower Beta than the ETF.  That sounds like a pretty good deal!  But before we get too excited, we need to make sure that these results are actually significant.  To do that, we're going to look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF's standard deviation.  If the two are different, then we can say that the results are statistically significant.",
            "Dream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's top poems, and he thought it was his best work. In this poem, you'll find the word \"Thulé\" popping up in lines 6 and 56 - it was a term that Poe got from Virgil, or so says Mabbott. Virgil used it to refer to an island north of Britain that the Greeks thought was the edge of the known world. However, there's another source that might be responsible for Poe's use of the term. Poe was really into German writers, and one of his favorites was Goethe.\n\nThis is important because it shows how familiar Poe was with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, thinks that Poe copied some of his ideas from Goethe's writing. The Oxford Companion to English Literature says that Goethe was a big deal in the literary world for his poetic drama Faust, which came out in two parts, first in 1808 and again in 1832, the year Goethe died. Inside Faust's second part is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which is all about a king whose wife dies after giving him a fancy goblet. The king gets super drunk, cries a lot, and decides it's time to die too. He gives away his stuff to his kids, except the goblet, and then walks off a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and checks out. The King of Thulé is a bit like the king in Dream-Land, maybe even a dark twin of Poe's struggles with loss and drinking. Goethe's Faust was even adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his writing, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again in \"Dream-Land\", where he uses it as the opening and closing lines for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are kind of like two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place where he's haunted by dead friends and sees a world without color. This is similar to how Goethe's king feels after losing his wife - he's all alone, lost his will to live, and is just going through the motions. It's like Poe is stepping into Goethe's poem and describing it from his own perspective.\n\nGoethe was a big deal in the literary world, and Poe would have known about him for sure because of his respect for Tennyson. Poe even said that he admired Tennyson. Poe would've also been exposed to Goethe's work through all the reproductions that were happening after the original publication.",
            "Is it possible that a customer would get punitive damages in court after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store because the manager was eating dinner instead of cleaning up the mess, even though he'd been told twice about it? Probably not, but a judge wouldn't immediately dismiss the claim. To win punitive damages, the customer would have to prove that the manager was being super reckless and didn't care about the harm that could happen, which is called \"despicable\" in the law. This customer can argue that the manager should have known how bad it would be if he didn't clean up the spill because a bunch of people had already slipped and fallen in the same store just a few months ago, and he still did nothing. It's not a super strong argument, but it makes sense given that six people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009 and the manager didn't do anything about it. \n\nOn October 13th, an employee told the manager about the spill, but the manager said he was too busy eating dinner to deal with it. Another employee reminded him about 15 minutes later, and he said the same thing. Then, at 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt pretty badly. Before that accident, there had been five other slip-and-fall incidents in the same store in 2009. Now the customer is suing the store for money because of her injury and we're thinking about filing a motion to get the court to toss out the part of the lawsuit that wants punitive damages.\n\nIn California, you can get punitive damages if someone did something really bad on purpose or was super reckless and didn't care about hurting others. The law says that's called \"malice,\" and it means either intentionally causing harm or doing something super bad that you knew could hurt someone, and then going ahead and doing it anyway. In one case, a court said that's exactly what happened when someone knew something was going to be super bad, but they still chose to do it and hurt someone.",
            "About four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC, which got me thinking about a really big question: is Islam a hostile religion?  To be honest, I think this question is more relevant now than ever, especially when you look back at what's happened since 9/11.  From what I've observed, the media's view of Islam has gone from pretty negative to extremely tolerant in the US.  It's crazy to think that back in 2001, a presidential candidate with Islamic ties, like Barack Obama, would have been a total long shot.\n\nThe Story of the Prophet really caught my attention.  This biography of Muhammad conflicts with what I thought I knew about him.  I used to think that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, but the story presents him as a totally different guy - a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled by others.  People started to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out one by one.  It's weird to see how the biography is written in a way that makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, just live his life and let the miracles speak for themselves.  This kind of writing is actually misleading because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  It's like they're taking credit for Jesus' life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nI also noticed that the biography tries to show how people converted to Islam on their own, but the stories are all second- or third-hand.  It's like they're trying to prove the truth of the stories, but it makes them seem suspicious.  The thing that really gets me is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect guy who's humble, endearing, wise, and gentle, but history says the opposite.  It's hard not to wonder if Muslims today really know the truth behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's roots and the actual teachings of Jesus got lost in the shuffle as the faith evolved after his death.  If we look at it in big picture terms, we can see how Christianity drifted further and further away from its original ideas.  Nowadays, it seems like there's a growing awareness and a more progressive mindset.  Traditionalists might resist any changes, but they might not be influential enough to hold things back.  As time goes on, people will become more aware of the history of Christianity, and a desire will grow to separate the added stuff from what Jesus really taught.  It might take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable:  There will be a big reversal in Christianity's history, and it will return to its original form.  A movement will grow, and it'll strip away all the extra layers of doctrine, kind of like the clock turning backward, until all you're left with is Jesus' original message.  When this trend hits the US and Europe, it'll spread like wildfire, and people will start following Jesus' ideas like it's the 1st century all over again.  The church as an institution will still be strong, but because people will be going back to the basics, there'll be more similarity between different groups and regions, rather than differences.  History is full of examples of reversals - just think about how the Roman Empire used to hate Christians, but later they took over the empire.  Our country went from having African-American slaves to having African-American leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity, and it'll be a big reversal of history as people search for the source.  It's crucial to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors, not literal statements, for this to happen.  So what's been added to Christianity since Jesus' time?\n\nIf we go way back in time, we see only Judaism, the root of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all part of the Jewish faith.  But the Jewish people weren't a single unit - they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common folk.",
            "I think The Jungle really shows the darker side of human nature. People, deep down, are super selfish and only care about themselves. They just want to live the best life possible and don't worry about anyone else. The Jungle shows this in lots of ways. The owners and bosses of the big factories are the most obvious example. All they care about is making their companies huge and awesome, no matter who gets hurt or what gets in their way. They don't care about the pollution they're creating or the animals and people getting hurt because of it. Upton Sinclair does a great job of painting a picture of how bad it is with his words, like when he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's showing how much damage they're causing and how the owners don't care about anyone or anything getting hurt. They're just all about the money.\n\nThe bosses and owners also didn't care about their workers who were making them rich. They would do anything to save a buck, like, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They made their workers work super long hours and then would lay off huge groups of people without any warning or help. Back then, there weren't many laws to protect workers' safety or well-being, so the bosses and owners were basically in charge and could do whatever they wanted. They expected the workers to just deal with the terrible conditions they were living and working in, and there were no organizations to help them. The unions that formed were more of a problem because they made money off the workers. It was like the workers were slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery\".",
            "A lot of authors are really good at making readers feel a certain way about important topics. They use different techniques to do this, but some are way more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master at this in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs up words that don't usually go together to give readers a certain vibe about a subject. Other times, he gives a symbol meaning and then uses it for the same thing. Fitzgerald does this with lots of colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for some of these colors, like white and gray, and then uses that meaning to make readers feel a certain way about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald uses the technique of giving meaning to colors and then using them to make readers feel something in a big way with white and gray. He makes white mean something fancy and high class, while gray is more old and faded. He sets this up at the start of the novel by using both colors all the time. Everyone's always wearing white - Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" all the time (8), and even guys like Nick and Tom are wearing white too: Nick's got \"white flannels\" (41) for Gatsby's party, and Tom's wearing a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle. Even Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick's describing Gatsby's party, and the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald takes it to the next level by using these colors to describe boring, everyday things: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56) on his way to work, and the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. He even describes ordinary people and places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27). After Fitzgerald gets this meaning across, he uses white and gray to make readers see certain subjects as unimportant or just part of a crowd. This starts with Daisy. After a while without using these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74), and readers start to see her as just a uniform thing that Gatsby wants and longs for. He uses more of this technique around Daisy to make her seem like just a uniform addition, for example, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she's again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a super productive agricultural hotspot thanks to its amazing climate. It's all sunshine and mild vibes here. You can grow all sorts of tasty crops like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a huge demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the area, with many local groups having crazy long waiting lists. People are totally into organic eggs and milk too. Some of these organic farms even offer tours, hiking trails, and birdwatching spots, which is a win-win for the landowner and the environment. This kind of setup lets them tap into government programs that benefit both the farmer and the wildlife. It's like killing two birds with one stone.\n\nOrganic farming has its perks, like a more diverse range of plants and wildlife in the area because there are no yucky chemicals in the soil and water. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Organic farming can be way more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming. You have to spend more time and effort removing pests and weeds and fertilizing the soil without using harsh chemicals. And, let's be real, organic farms often have higher losses and are way less efficient than big commercial operations. On top of that, some beneficial practices that help wildlife, like planting cover crops and removing invasive species, can be super time-consuming and costly. So, it's no wonder the landowner in this scenario might be looking for some financial help or expert advice to maximize both their profits and wildlife-friendly practices.\n\nThe land I'm talking about is a 160-acre plot near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. This land is in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still a work in progress, but it currently covers over a hundred plant and animal species, including some that are super rare and endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and might be listed as endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land has been home to Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing and wood production for a while. I chose this piece of land from a real estate website and did some research on government programs that might help a small farmer like this one reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. I even found an organic farm in the same area that I used as a model for what this landowner might try to achieve.",
            "When it comes to negotiation, culture plays a huge role. Culture isn't something that can be defined by just a few words, and it's not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing. It's the opposite of what you might think it is, and it's often different from what you might expect. For example, saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are super accommodating\" is way too broad and doesn't really capture the full picture. What's more helpful to a negotiator is understanding what a culture's values and attitudes are, and how they might impact the negotiation. When you're dealing with a culture that's different from your own, you end up comparing it to your own culture, and that's when things can get pretty relatable. \n\nTrying to understand a foreign culture or mindset can be a real challenge. It might involve studying its history or figuring out its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, you should just accept it for what it is and work with it, especially when you're in a tough bargaining position. And even if you're the one who's visiting someone else's turf, showing respect for their traditions and values can really help you get past any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nBut here's the thing: culture isn't just about national differences. Even within the same country, companies can have their own unique corporate cultures. For example, some companies might value long hours in the office, while others are way more relaxed. You can see evidence of this in things like dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. And let me tell you, American corporate culture is all over the map - some companies are super formal, while others are super casual. It's like you need to dig deeper to really understand what's going on.\n\nValues are even more important to get a handle on, because they're like the underlying reason why a culture is the way it is. If a culture values things like saving face or communal harmony, you can bet that a negotiator from that culture won't be willing to publicly shame their company or their boss to get a good deal. On the other hand, if a culture values getting a hard bargain, you won't see the negotiator settling for anything less than the best deal possible. So, it's really helpful to consider these kinds of things before you sit down at the negotiation table. And, if you can, it's even better to get to know your opponent on a personal level - it can really make the negotiation go more smoothly.",
            "The quote 'There is no God' isn't a phrase you'd hear from St. Anselm or St. Thomas Aquinas. That's a line from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and it's where Anselm starts his argument for the existence of God. This belief is also shared by Thomas Aquinas. Since their arguments are both in defense of the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both right, and we'll compare them later. To keep things simple, we'll only talk about their arguments for the God of the Bible. If we were to consider other types of gods, it wouldn't let us fairly compare their ideas. \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's assume both Anselm and Aquinas are correct in their belief in God. We'll show that, even though they bring up valid points, neither of them provides a complete basis for believing in God.\n\nTo get started, let's look at Anselm's argument. He thinks you can find proof of God by looking within yourself. He claims that because we can imagine God, we can't imagine that he doesn't exist. His idea is hard to put into words, but basically, he says that proof for God is already inside our minds. He thinks we don't need to look outside ourselves for the truth about God; we just need to think about what we already know is true. This idea of trusting in something without concrete evidence is, in Christian texts, called faith.\n\nAnselm's idea is different from Aquinas's. Aquinas thinks you can prove the existence of God using logic and facts, without needing any faith. This would be helpful in spreading Christianity, because new followers wouldn't need to accept something they can't prove. They could be convinced by logic alone. Aquinas uses five different logical arguments to prove God's existence: change, causation, being in a state of uncertainty, degrees of excellence, and how things fit together. In each one, he's saying that God must exist because it makes sense logically. Imagine you're trying to complete a puzzle, and someone tells you that you're missing one piece. You can figure out what the missing piece looks like just by looking at the rest of the puzzle.",
            "So, I'm learning about ancient times – like, a really long time ago, over 2,500 years ago. It was around the fifth or sixth century BCE, and a dude who would eventually be called Buddha was born. This guy renounced the world, became enlightened, and started teaching his ideas, which eventually led to the creation of Buddhism, specifically the Theravada branch. If you think back to when Buddha was alive, it was definitely different from how it is now. For instance, Sri Lanka has this super old tradition where they celebrate this water-cutting ceremony, but Buddha never actually taught about anything like that. It's pretty cool how the religion has changed over time – not just some superficial stuff, but also the core ideas that Buddhism is built on.\n\nThere are some important terms that I'll be using a lot in this discussion. When I say internal, I mean something that's inside the Buddhist community – like, it's not from outsiders, but from people who are actually a part of it. External means something that's coming from outside the community. Hostile means it's trying to hurt the community, even if it's not necessarily a bad thing. And benign means it's not trying to harm or help the community, even if it accidentally does one or the other. These terms will show up a lot.\n\nFirst off, I need to break down the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in this thing called the Triple Gem – it's like the Buddha, the teachings (Dhamma), and the community (Sangha). The Dhamma is basically the Buddhist texts, which are divided into three groups. The Sutta Pitaka has the sayings of Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper stuff about the meaning of life, like no soul (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and how everything is temporary (Anicca). If you understand these ideas, you can stop going through this cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara), and you can also get rid of desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha). The Vinaya Pitaka also gives rules for monks and laypeople, like the five precepts (no killing, lying, stealing, misbehaving, or getting drunk). Monks have way more rules to follow. One of the most important ideas in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico are like two countries that used to hate each other for a super long time - 57 whole years (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The worst part of their rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 when the US basically defeated Mexico and took Texas and the American Southwest (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). They had a bunch of other clashes too, but it all finally settled down just before World War I. I guess it's like what happens when two neighbors can't agree on stuff. It's the same with lots of countries who have a border with another country - they often disagree on big things like money, culture, and stuff (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nIt's not like the US and Mexico are the only ones with a long-standing rivalry - lots of countries with a shared border have similar problems. David M. Pletcher (1977) said that Mexico and Cuba are the only countries where the US has super long-standing diplomatic issues (p. 41). I guess it's because they're close to the US and have been at odds with it for a while. Other countries in Latin America have gotten along pretty well with the US.\n\nIt turns out that the US and Mexico didn't get along because of some pretty deep-seated issues - it's like they had a major disagreement about what to believe in. Sally Frahm (2001) said that back in the day, Americans were super opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). It's kinda like how the US and the Soviet Union didn't get along during the Cold War - they had some big ideological differences. But with the US and Mexico, it was more about their different religions. This whole thing started because the US and Mexico inherited some bad feelings from their former colonial rulers (the English and Spanish).\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted 17 times when the US and Mexico disagreed over 57 years. Most of these disagreements were about border stuff, like when Mexican bandits would cross over into the US, or when American outlaws would cause trouble in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). It wasn't until the US and Mexico both started cracking down on their borders that things started to get better.\n\nSchmitt (1974) said that things started to calm down when Mexico realized it needed the US a lot more (p. 109), and the US stopped trying to expand its territory and started focusing on helping Mexico out financially (p. 110).",
            "It's been 15 years since an illness I never even knew existed suddenly turned my life upside down and left me disabled. I was 46 at the time, working as a nurse, and had chosen the profession to escape feelings of uncertainty from my childhood. I was constantly told, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" but that didn't live up to reality. As a result, I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and to be honest, I'm still struggling every day. What keeps me going is the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends - I'm not as strong as I thought I was when disaster struck. \n\nMy point is that no matter how prepared we think we are, life can still throw us curveballs. There are no guarantees, and when the going gets tough, people need each other's help. I agree that we should question our reliance on the government, but instead of building our own shelters, we should be learning to trust and support each other. The idea of rugged individualism that Conservatives talk about isn't entirely accurate - the pioneers who settled the West didn't do it alone; they relied on each other for survival. \n\nWhile being prepared is a good idea, it's just as essential to build relationships with the people around us. I've got my emergency kit ready, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and all the essentials, but I also know that having neighbors who care can make all the difference. If you have the resources, it's great to have a small farm and a wood stove, but what's most important is knowing the people who live next door.",
            "So, what drives organisms to evolve in the way they do? Are there any roadblocks or restrictions that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said it was like trying to put into mathematical terms even the simplest living things. Fast forward to now, and we're still scratching our heads - but, we've been using math to help us understand certain parts of mollusk shell development through both how they grow and how they evolved over time (think Raup and Stanley's work from 1981 as an example). Our project is all about using mathematical modeling of how Prunum develops over time and in its history, combined with some actual experiments, to figure out what's behind the direction and strength of evolutionary changes. We used X-rays of Prunum species to pick out some key stats that we could then use to model different possible and real shell shapes. These numbers got plugged into a computer program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995), and we used it to imagine what shell shapes could be possible. This stuff is being combined with other studies to get a better handle on what's going on in the history of this group of animals.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that's constantly moving through space over time - it's kind of like a journey that's 360 degrees long. The parts of the shell that twist around in a spiral pattern are called whorls, and they're all connected by a line that runs through the center of the shell, called the columella. The speed at which these whorls get bigger can vary, and each one is separated by a line called a suture. In most shells, the biggest whorl is the last one (that's the body whorl). The spire is all the whorls except the last one, and the tip of the spire is the apex, while the other end is the base. The animal pops out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways, like from the front, back, opening, or from the side that's opposite the opening. Usually, when we look at a shell, it's from the front, with the opening facing us and the pointy end pointing up.\n\nHere's a cool way to count the whorls: first, look at the shell from the front, then find where the first line between two whorls starts. Draw a line between them, and count the whorls from that line - you can even estimate to a quarter of a whorl if you need to.\n\nA shell can also be thought of like a bunch of openings that move through space and time as the animal builds its shell. You can actually track the path of the opening by looking at the center of each whorl's opening, and the horizontal and vertical distance from the center to the edge of the opening. This path can be shown on a graph or mathematically. Once we have the math formula, we can play around with different parameters and see how they affect how the mollusk builds its shell.",
            "I've been going over the facts about neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia, and it's been a real bummer to see that there hasn't been a lot of change in the past ten years.  They're doing okay with some of the Millennium Development Goals, like getting people clean water and a decent bathroom, but when it comes to how well they're doing on child and mom health stuff, they're way behind where they need to be to meet their goals by 2015.  There are a lot of reasons for this, which I'll get into below, and it's pretty clear that they need to beef up their health system instead of just focusing on one-off programs.\n\tFirst off, Indonesia has made some progress with getting more births where a trained health worker is present, but 72% still means that a lot of moms aren't getting the help they need if something goes wrong.  It's like, yeah, more people are getting this, but it's not like it's a guarantee they'll get the care they need.  Plus, the ones who are trained are often just traditional workers, like midwives, who can't handle emergencies.  You can bet that a lot of the deaths are because of things like bleeding during pregnancy, which is a big problem.  So, even though they're getting better at this one thing, there's still lots to work on.  Another area that's a concern is how many kids with diarrhea under five are actually getting help from a health pro, and it's pretty low across the whole country.  They also don't have much data on how well new moms are doing after they give birth, but it's clear that's an issue too.\n\tWhen it comes to C-sections, they're not happening often enough - only about 4% of births are C-sections.  But what's even more worrying is that the rate is way lower in rural areas, at only 2%.  This shows that people in the cities are getting way more access to healthcare than those in the sticks.  It's like they're leaving the poor people behind.  And it gets even worse when you look at how well people in different income groups are using healthcare services - there's a huge gap between the richest and poorest people, and it's almost like they can't afford it.  Clearly, people have to pay out of pocket for healthcare, which is a real problem. \n\tNow, when it comes to figuring out how to fix all this, the main question is whether Indonesia should focus on specific programs or fix the whole health system at once.  On the one hand, targeting one area of healthcare sounds good because it's like, hey, let's get this one thing done and be done with it.  But the problem is that when you put all your eggs in one basket, other areas suffer and people start working on that one thing instead of other important stuff.  Just look at what happened with HIV/AIDS funding - it totally took resources away from family planning.  Plus, having lots of programs going on at the same time just means you end up with a bunch of duplicated and uncoordinated services, which makes it harder to get things done.",
            "Victorian novels are super detailed and often focus on the aristocracy of that time period, but there are two novels that stand out for not following this pattern - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these novels have a mysterious vibe and a bit of the weird and unusual, which is pretty different from the norm for the Victorian era. This adds depth to the characters and lets us see into their thoughts and feelings. They're not just rich people, they're real people with their own problems and emotions.\n\nI was totally confused, like I was walking around with Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing, and I could hear what they were saying. When I snapped back to reality, I was talking to them, but I didn't know what was going on. Suddenly, loud noises and flashes of light hit me, and I felt like I was being pulled around by some invisible force. It was all a bit fuzzy, but I could feel this gnawing pain that wouldn't go away.\n\n In these two novels, mystery often shows up in dream sequences or dream-like moments, but it's used in different ways. In Oliver Twist, these strange happenings often reveal what's going on inside Oliver's head, what's bothering him, and what he knows about the world around him. When Oliver gets shot in chapter 28, it's like he's reliving it in a dream, as he tries to find help. The scene shows how little control Oliver had over the events unfolding around him, and how desperate he was, as shown through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, and all his senses are numb; he doesn't notice the force that's taking him away, and he feels his fear and pain all over again, but without the shock. This makes us wonder whose fault it is that Oliver's in this situation, since it's definitely not his own. This scene also implies that Oliver's giving up, like he's been broken by Fagin and is just accepting his fate, which affects his ability to make decisions. Otherwise, we'd expect him to try to take action, even if it's just to save himself.\n\nThe day passed by so quickly, like it was just a blur. I mean, it was gone as soon as it started, and then night came back around again - it was so long and silent, but also so short and fleeting.",
            "It's been a couple of years since I worked at an after-school program helping elementary students with their studies, but one kid in particular stuck in my mind. I was assigned to help a little boy named Adrian, who was really struggling with reading. I soon realized something was off; he could pronounce some of the letters perfectly, but others were a complete mystery. It was a weird situation, especially since he spoke perfect English - or so I thought, until I met his mom. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish, and I was struggling to communicate with her, my Spanish skills being pretty basic. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized Adrian was actually reading just fine, but he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. I'm not sure if this revelation made a big difference in his reading, but I hope he's doing okay now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not as straightforward as we think; even kids who speak perfect English can still struggle with reading. I'm sure everyone agrees that this is a problem, so what's the solution? For Adrian, the answer was simple: extra help with the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's much more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these things on their own will fix the problem. The key is to combine them all.\n\nFirst off, the dual language system is a great idea that benefits not just kids who speak Spanish at home, but all kids. Studies have shown that kids in two-way bilingual education programs perform better academically. There's a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we implemented these programs in every classroom, all kids would benefit. So, how do we make it happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unfair. But we could definitely have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our teachers and students.",
            "Most of us learn from a young age that there's something greater than ourselves out there, something that's hard to fully comprehend.  Some people go to church, temple, or find their own inner answers.  Many accept the faith passed down from our parents, while others reject it and think there's nothing beyond our own understanding.  We might start with one set of values, only to change our minds later and adopt another.  Whatever path we take, we're on a journey to figure out who we are through our own unique take on spirituality.  We're searching for a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness.\n\nMy dad told me his favorite bird was cardinals when I asked him.  We were sitting on the porch, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof while we smoked our cigarettes.  The rain pouring down was drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, like he was half thinking, half remembering something.  He'd lost weight and his clothes hung loose on him.  His hair had gotten thinner, too.  He kept staring at the rain, avoiding eye contact.  I felt scared, alone, and didn't know how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him without making it feel more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain during that June twilight.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had only prolonged his suffering; I couldn't figure out what the point of that was.  If there was a God, I wondered, had he stopped listening to me a long time ago?  I said no prayers that night, alone in the darkness. \n\nI didn't want to watch him die.  I didn't want to see my creator slip away.  I wanted to remember my dad for how he lived, not how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone else, better than his family.  I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him go.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is basically a contradiction in terms, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel - \"an oxymoron for 'Old-New'.\" The Gothic genre's been getting a bad rap, but it's also been praised for evoking the 'terrible sublime.' People have accused it of being shallow, but others have argued that it's actually pretty deep. The very first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, took elements from old romances and modern novels and mashed them together to create something entirely new. Walpole called it \"A Gothic Story\" and it was a game-changer in terms of literary expression. The Gothic genre is all about throwing back to medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time The Castle of Otranto came out, the word \"gothic\" was already being used to describe a bunch of different things - people, styles, and time periods. It was seen as outdated and unsophisticated compared to the modern world. But the combination of Gothic flair and the new way novels were written (giving readers a more personal look at the characters' psyches) is what's kept the Gothic genre around for so long and made it both old and new to readers.\n\nOne of the most important Gothic ideas in these novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, which involves training a proper knight, is both carried over and altered in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is a big deal for Gothic writers because it represents the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and they saw a lack of that ideal in their own society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the Gothic past gets idealized and romanticized (which hints at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic). Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of political turmoil and was worried about the future. He thought that the supposed morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in his own society. This idea is clear in characters like Frederic. When we meet him, he's already shown to embody many chivalric traits - he's a prince, he's been through tragedy, and he's supposed to have been killed by infidels. The image of the gallant and courteous knight is exaggerated, which brings the Gothic trope of excess into play.",
            "Supply chain management is like a crazy rollercoaster of goods moving from the customer's order to raw materials, production, and finally to the customer's hands. It all started back in 1982 when Keith Oliver, a super cool consultant, came up with the term supply chain management. He basically described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently. It's like a puzzle with six key pieces: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These six elements work together to give customers the best service ever.\n\nOkay, let's dive into the first piece of the puzzle: production. It's like the foundation of the whole supply chain thing. Production is where everything starts, and it's all about figuring out when, why, where, and how to produce the goods. Managers need to know what customers want, and they can find out by checking out the market. The market is like the ultimate indicator of what customers are looking for. Once they've analyzed the market and understand customer demand, they're ready to decide what products to produce, how many to make, and where to make them. They've got to consider customer satisfaction and demand, or it's gonna be a disaster.\n\nFor example, when I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, they had these super detailed booklets and processes for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. It was like a well-oiled machine, and it helped them work smoothly without any confusion. \n\nThe second key element is supply. It's all about making strategic decisions that determine what a company can do and who they can partner with. A company might have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers need to decide which division is best for each process, or they might outsource the work to other companies to save money and increase flexibility. The goal is to create velocity – providing quality, flexibility, and low costs all at the same time.",
            "There's a sign that reads 'Hitler is alive in Burma.' If you believe that, you're probably as clueless as I am. I just saw this chick from Juno standing on a street corner with a sign that said the same thing. I'm guessing she just got it from the bottom of a shoebox of crap ideas. Burma's like a country in Southeast Asia that's got a pretty bad government. They took over in 1962 and have been a bunch of tyrants ever since. There was this huge protest in 2007, it was like, the first big one in years. These Buddhist monks were at the front of it, and they all wore orange robes. It became known as 'The Saffron Revolution.' The government was all cool with the monks at first, but then things took a dark turn and it was like a war or something. The government was going after the monks, invading their monasteries, and arresting journalists. One Japanese dude got killed just for being there. I don't know the exact number of people who died, but some guy who used to be in the army said it's way more than they're saying.\n\nThis stuff's not new, though. Governments have been trying to shut down anyone who disagrees with them for as long as humans have been around. Like, the ancient Romans thought their rulers were gods. In Japan, the emperor is actually thought to be a god or whatever. And don't even get me started on George W. Bush's buddies with that dude from Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere are some pretty crazy examples of this stuff. Like that time in Tiananmen Square in 1989. It was like a huge protest against the Chinese government and they killed a bunch of people. The Chinese government says 200-300 died, but other people say it was way more like 2,000-3,000. Then there was the Rwandan genocide, where these Hutu militias were just killing Tutsis and anyone else they didn't like. And don't forget about Hitler's thing with the Jews. It's all pretty messed up.",
            "So, Duke Ellington's influence on jazz was pretty much due to his staying power and his ability to get his orchestra sounding just right. Most of the time, his piano parts in the songs picked for this assignment are pretty subtle, but as a composer, Ellington was a pro at creating super intricate and complex pieces that made each band member shine. He built the foundation for the band to improvise and also wrote super tight pieces that fit each person's style. This way, he made the entire orchestra sound really cool and unique for each song. Ellington was a master at figuring out how each player sounded and how they fit together, which allowed him to make some of the most awesome and groundbreaking jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Groove Music dictionary talks about how Ellington's sound and innovation are all about using voice as a jazz instrument, like in \"Creole Love Call.\" This was one of the first times he used voice to add some extra texture and tone without getting in the way of the lyrics. It's a slow, 12-bar blues piece with six parts, and it's really interesting to see how he plays with different styles. Here's what happens in each part:\n\nPart 1: It's all about call and response between the voice and the woodwinds, with the voice starting smooth and getting rough towards the end.\nPart 2: There's a muted trumpet solo that takes the basic melody and makes it sound even cooler with some long, blue notes.\nPart 3: The clarinet takes center stage with a super high and wild solo, and the piano is in the background with a subtle, syncopated beat.\nPart 4: The whole band echoes the first part with call and response, but this time it's the brass and woodwinds.\nPart 5: This is the climax, where the woodwinds start calling out in a high register and the brass and rhythm sections are all over the place.\nPart 6: It goes back to the first part, but this time the voice is growling like an instrument and soloing like crazy.\n\nIt's just one example of how Ellington used voice to add some serious tone color to his music. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he takes it to the next level by combining his skill at writing tight arrangements with his ear for tone color. He gets \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox on scat singing to create this super rich and complementary sound. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to make the melody on muted trombone sound super cool.",
            "There was this weird feeling inside of her that she just couldn't shake off. It started when she was 14 and had just begun to get into the whole teenage scene, and it was still going strong at 17. She was convinced it was something more than just a thing she needed, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what that 'something' was. Guys had tried to catch her attention, but none of them did. She often wondered why on earth she felt like this. She'd thought about it so much over the years that she'd come up with some pretty wild theories, but nothing that made total sense. So she just went with it, constantly questioning her own desires.\n\nAt home, things were usually chill. Her parents were pretty laid back and never fought with each other. They rarely even got into it with her, and when they did, it was just because she was being a bit too independent. She was the total opposite of her parents, super energetic and fun. People loved her for it. But today, things were different.\n\nAs she walked from room to room looking for some inspiration, she heard a loud scream from the kitchen and her heart started racing. She rushed in to find her mom on the ground, looking really hurt. Her mom was saying 'ow' over and over and her daughter freaked out. \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" She quickly ran to her mom's side and helped her up, trying to be brave. \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mom's words were all jumbled and rushed, and her daughter could tell she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay, Mom, where do I pick you up?\" Her mom pointed and she was grateful she'd taken self-defense classes so she could help her out. She carried her mom to the car, got her settled in, and sped off.\n\nThe hospital was a whole different story - it was all sick smells and worried faces. Her brain wasn't really taking it in though, she was too focused on her mom. She got her to the hospital and called out for help, then just sat there waiting for the doctors to figure out what was going on. Someone wheeled her mom off to get checked out, and she was left sitting there, worried sick.\n\nApparently, her mom had tried to grab a vase from a super high cabinet and fallen off a stepping stool. Whoa. That was a pretty crazy thing to happen.",
            "This study checked if sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" - aka the \"Med diet\" - really helps cut the risk of getting heart disease and strokes and even dying from them. We made a special version of the Med diet called \"alternate Mediterranean diet\" (aMed) that's a bit different from the original. It's all about eating a lot of plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans (but not potatoes), plus some fish, and less of the fatty stuff from animals. You can even have a little bit of booze if you want.\n\nMost research about the Med diet has shown that following it can be good for you, but this time we were looking at how it affects stroke and stroke deaths. Previous studies said that people who ate a Med diet were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart problems, and even lost weight better than those who ate a low-fat diet. But nobody checked if it also helps with strokes.\n\nWe looked at 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old who weren't sick with heart problems or diabetes. They're all part of a huge study of nurses in 11 US states. Every year from 1984 to 2004, we asked them about their eating habits through these questionnaires, and we used a special score to see how well they followed the aMed diet. Most of the nurses kept participating for the whole 20 years, and we checked the accuracy of their answers by looking at their medical records. When we didn't have those records, we made an educated guess, which was right about 17% of the time for strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nWe also looked at things like their weight, if they smoked, if they took aspirin or multivitamins, and how much exercise they got. To make sure our results were accurate, we averaged the women's aMed scores over 2 years instead of looking at one year at a time. We also took into account things that could mess with our results, like age, smoking, weight, and stuff like that.\n\nUsing a special math tool, we found out that eating more like the Mediterranean diet helped lower the risk of heart disease and strokes in these women. Out of all the women we checked, 2391 had a heart attack, 1763 had a stroke, and 1077 died from either of those things. Women who ate the most like the aMed diet were less likely to get heart disease or a stroke than those who didn't eat like that at all (their risk was 71% lower).",
            "Back in 2007, the United States was hit with this super harsh financial crisis. People were losing their jobs, the housing market tanked, and all these big, super-important companies were basically left for dead. And guess what? We're still dealing with the aftermath, so we're all like, \"Dude, how did this happen and how can we prevent it from happening again?\" So, in a nutshell, the financial crisis was basically caused by some pretty selfish and clueless political decisions that made banks and firms give out all these sketchy loans to people who weren't exactly in a good financial spot. Meanwhile, these huge companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were like, \"Hey, we gotta help out these people by buying and re-selling these mortgages,\" but they were all based on shaky ground. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were all, \"Oh no, we're low on cash,\" and then they passed the chaos onto the next guy, and the next guy, and the next guy in line.\n\nBut the roots of this financial mess go way back to 1999 when the Clinton administration was all, \"Hey, I want to get re-elected, so let's relax some of the lending rules and see what happens.\" And, well, it didn't exactly turn out as planned. Steven Holmes from the New York Times was all, \"Uh-oh, we're gonna have a problem if we keep doing this,\" and he even predicted the whole thing would end in a massive bailout. And, guess what? He was totally right. It was like a domino effect, where all these fancy new mortgage things like adjustable-rate mortgages and collateralized debt obligations just tied everything together, making the whole economy super vulnerable to even the smallest change.\n\nIt's like, a whole bunch of factors came together to make the economy freak out. People were taking on way too much debt and getting all caught up in the housing market, making them super susceptible to even tiny changes in prices. And then, BAM! The housing bubble bursts and all these banks that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities are all, \"Uh-oh, we're toast!\" The top five investment banks had over $4 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which is like, a huge chunk of the country's GDP. In the end, some banks were sold for peanuts, others were dismantled, and some were forced to become super-regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie were like, \"Whoops, we're in trouble,\" and the government had to step in to take control of them in 2008.",
            "You know, the big reveal – that part in your story where you spread your wings and take to the skies with your writing, leaving everyone in awe. Or, on the other hand, your readers zone out and hit the back button as they silently curse your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to frantically yell at her monitor when she finds herself stuck in a sea of unnecessary details, and it's never the fun kind.\n\nExposition – that pesky part of your story where you lay out the groundwork, but end up bogging down the whole thing.  Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin tend to stumble into lengthy descriptions that amount to nothing, or worse, are just too much.\n\nWe've all heard the advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" but the truth is, Dr. Merlin still manages to get sucked into info dumps that leave readers yawning.  Exposition is that annoying voice in the back of your head telling you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff – not to be confused with that other pesky voice urging you to share every single detail about each character's childhood.\n\nIn a nutshell, exposition is when you're told about what happened, and it's usually just plain old telling.  In film, it's that one character that launches into a lengthy, tedious monologue, while in fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.  You're reading a story and you're told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they got hitched in a fancy ceremony, and that her husband was brutally murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to drag on for two whole pages, with both of them only getting two lines of dialogue each.  No, you'd expect the author to take their time to develop the husband's character, to show through his words and actions how deeply he adored his wife.  You'd also expect the heroine to reveal her feelings through her reactions and actions, especially if the story later on tells you that this was the case.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and give you insight into the heroine's character, showing what she saw in him, how strong their bond was, and what clues about her thoughts and dreams she reflected from his perspective.  You'd feel her pain when he died and become more connected to her as a result.\n\nIn essence, you'd want substance to back up the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  As a writer, it's your job to provide that meat.\n\nSometimes it's tempting to rush through certain parts, like introducing a new character and dumping a bunch of unnecessary details about their past.  Perhaps you know he used to be in the Air Force, he's the night manager of a gas station now, he's been married twice, has no kids, loves fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.  Don't do it.  Provide your readers with something more.",
            "Today I caught up on the news from Columbus, Ohio. I watched two newscasts, the first one being NBC 4 this morning on August 13, 2011. Their lead story was about a disturbing incident where a man named Shad Hostettler stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. I noticed they only spent about two minutes on it, which seemed like the right amount of time to me since it was a developing story. The only details they shared were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was already under arrest. I also saw his mug shot and thought he looked pretty sinister.\n \nThe next story was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers who got shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was in critical condition, and the police were still searching for the shooter, but no arrests had been made yet. This story seemed really short, and I'm guessing it might have been because the victim was black and from a black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that minorities get glossed over when they're victims of a crime, and it's like the media doesn't care about them as much. I mean, if a white person was in the same situation, the media would be all over it.\n \nThe news also covered a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They talked about where they think the incident happened and said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. The police are offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n \nNext up was a story about the weather forecast for Saturday, with rain and thunderstorms predicted for the afternoon. They said the temperature would stay in the mid to low eighties all weekend. I thought they kept it a bit too short, but they probably wanted to leave it as a teaser to keep viewers tuning in.\n \nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The robber was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, and they made a big deal about how dark he was. I thought it was weird they spent so much time emphasizing that.\n \nAnother story was about a guy named Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was that they said he got sentenced to 300 months in prison instead of 25 years. I don't know if they thought that sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he's Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's this thing with brothers, you know? It's like, this super strong bond that's untouchable. Inside that bond, all these emotions are swirling around: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers somehow just get each other, in a way that no one else does, and when they look at each other, they're basically staring at themselves. It's when things get really tough that the true nature of that bond comes out, whether it's good or bad. When those feelings become super clear, they come with a big price to pay. Part of understanding this stuff is dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you can look a brother in the eye and see a part of yourself staring back, you see who you really are, not how others see you. Your true character is in the stuff you do and what happens because of it. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this whole brother thing, with all the crazy emotions that come with it. The story's set in this really vivid world, and these two guys go on this doomed journey. Bitter sadness clashes with intense pride in the crazy final scene, and only one of them gets out alive. The theme is all over the place, but it's mainly about the main character, Doodle, and his bro's interactions, as well as the narrator's point of view, which shows all the complicated feelings Doodle's got going on. \n\nDoodle's main thing is pride. From the beginning, when they first go out together, to their last, super intense trip, Doodle's all resentful towards his little bro, Doodle. He wanted a bro who'd be all into the same stuff as him, like learning how to hold his breath or climb trees. He wanted someone to hang out with in Horsehead Landing or sit with in the top fork of that big pine tree behind the barn. But that's just not possible with Doodle, 'cause he's got a weak heart and can't do all the cool stuff. The young Doodle had these huge dreams, and they get totally crushed when he realizes it's never gonna happen. He even thinks about killing Doodle, which is just wild, but then Doodle smiles at him, and suddenly he's all warm inside. That shows you that his feelings aren't as strong as he thought. Even though he's got some anger towards Doodle, deep down he loves the little guy.",
            "The human brain is a super cool, super complex thinking machine that's been around for ages. Over time, people's ideas about how it works have evolved along with technology - it used to be thought to be like a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and nowadays it's like a super-duper computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons aren't perfect and can sometimes lead to some pretty weird conclusions.\nFirst off, the brain takes in information from your senses - like touch, heat, sounds, or light - and turns it into a bunch of electrical signals. As this info gets processed in the brain, it gets transformed again and again in both top-down and bottom-up ways. For instance, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together tiny pieces of information like color, direction, and borders to figure out that you're looking at a box. Then, the brain uses the decisions it made earlier to speed up your recognition of the box, kinda like a shortcut.\nAfter a while, the brain decides which signals are important and which ones should be ignored. For example, even though your brain is processing every single blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, your brain's \"selective attention\" filter helps you tune it out. On the other hand, if someone yells out your name in a noisy room, you'd probably pick up on that way faster. There are lots of stages to this process, and the brain's attention filter is like a button that gets pressed again and again to decide what's important.\nFor the brain to process information, it needs to be stored somewhere. There are different kinds of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain encodes the information - there are special ways to do this depending on what kind of info it is. For example, words can be encoded based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean. Once the info is stored, the brain needs to keep it safe. Some studies on animals suggest that working memory, which lasts for about 20 seconds, is like a temporary electrical signal that zaps through a certain group of brain cells. Information in long-term memory, on the other hand, might be stored in the shape of certain special proteins.\nThere are tons of theories about how the brain organizes knowledge, ranging from how people remember things, to computer science ideas, to what happens in the brain itself. One popular idea is the semantic network model, which says that there are special nodes in the brain for concepts, and that they're connected to each other based on how they're related. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns of the dangers of a future where technology and capitalism are deeply intertwined in his novel Brave New World. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned to prioritize immediate happiness above all else. It's like they're trapped in a never-ending cycle, forced to conform to a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals his concerns about the emerging systems of his time. Terms like homogeny and reification, commonly used in Marxism, suggest that the novel is a commentary on the negative effects of these systems. \n\nCapitalism is also heavily criticized in Brave New World, particularly through the concept of false consciousness. Essentially, the general population is kept in the dark about their true relationship with other classes, and they're only concerned with their own gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of people, especially the lower classes like Delta and Gamma, who are made to crave consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this desire, making it seem like it's their own idea. The lower classes are essentially brainwashed into accepting their place in society, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are either unaware of the manipulation or choose to ignore it. The way the social classes interact with each other is a clear indication of the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and lack depth. The characters are one-dimensional, and even the main characters are often portrayed as lacking any real emotions or connections. This could be seen as Huxley's way of saying that the rise of technology and capitalism is stripping people of their free will and individuality. Love and strong emotions are non-existent, and people are only concerned with superficial interactions, like commenting on physical appearance. The fact that each class is content with their place in the hierarchy and follows the rules without question is a reflection of Marxist ideas about the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and obey.",
            "So, I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now, which is four and a half semesters, I guess. For a lot of us, getting around campus can be super tough. My freshman year I lived in an East Halls dorm room; basically as far east as you can get without counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It took me up to 25 minutes to get to classes in the Willard building, which is pretty central, especially when it's all yucky outside, like it often is in State College. I talked to an alum not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were totally separate from the rest of the school, with huge chunks of empty land in between. Nowadays, that space is filled with sports fields, brand new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this mobility problem? On a college campus, it's gotta be the bike. But just having a bike isn't enough - students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be made bike-friendly.\n\nI was talking to my friend who recently started biking again after a long break, and he said, \"Bikes are awesome.\" He told me, \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's literally the best way to get around.\" Not only is it good for your body, but it's also super efficient. Eating a bowl of oatmeal and doing a little exercise can get you 30 miles or more. Like many of us, I'm living off campus now, and it's just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I've done this year was buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with my bike, I can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is, Pollock Road is the straightest route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always easy, no matter if you're biking or not. There are some good things to say about walking too, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up way too much of my time. Walking to Thomas every day would be an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. Add all the other time I'd have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm planning on pursuing an education in social work with the ultimate goal of joining the Division of Family and Children Services to help kids who've been through abuse or neglect, as well as offer support to troubled families. When it comes to social work, I'm all about bringing the following core values to the table: service, respect, an honest approach, and dedication to making relationships between people better, along with constantly working on myself to stay sharp in my field. These values aren't just important for social workers; they're super important to me personally.\n\nI've always had a desire to help others, but I wasn't sure what career path I wanted to take. Throughout high school and college, I saw a lot of people trying to run away from their problems instead of facing them, and some turned to not-so-great coping mechanisms. Because of what I've seen, I decided to major in Psychology. Still unsure about my career path, I took a break after I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One summer, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old who was really nervous because he was staying with her – he was trying to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I found out that he'd called the police to their house. I went over to their place and talked to the police about my concerns, explaining that I'd just graduated from Piedmont College with a degree in Psychology. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I questioned them, they seemed really nervous and made excuses for their son's behavior, saying he was just trying to get people involved in \"simple\" family disputes. That experience made me seriously consider a career in social work to help kids deal with similar problems.\n\nI'm also really passionate about social justice. Society says that the individual is important, but we end up trying to be like everyone else instead of embracing our uniqueness. I'm all about being an individual and not limiting myself to what others think I should be. Throughout high school and college, I protested against social injustice in any way I could: I'd dye my hair weird colors, wear clothes that fit my style, get piercings that went against the norm, and speak out against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep speaking out against it.",
            "This paper explores the connection between the Biological and Sociocultural models and insomnia. The Biological model focuses on the genetic information passed down from our parents and medical aspects, while the Sociocultural model looks at the impact of environment on sleep, including things like where you live, your race, ethnicity, and income level. To understand these models, we'll look at various studies that relate to them and use them to explain each one better. We'll also critique the research to point out its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be broken down into three categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders that are connected to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders caused by medical problems or substances. The primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias, which are problems with falling asleep or staying asleep, and Parasomnias, which are sleep disorders that cause weird behaviors or physical things to happen while you're asleep. The Dyssonmias include Primary Insomnia, where you can't fall asleep or stay asleep, Primary Hypersomnia, where you can't stay awake, Narcolepsy, which involves extreme sleepiness and hallucinations, and a few others. The Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe sleep disorders connected to other mental health issues are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders. The Biological and Sociocultural models are especially useful for understanding the primary sleep disorders. Research on the Biological model has found that the hypothalamus in our brain has special cells that control our sleep-wake cycle. Scientists have done studies with mice and found that these cells have something called orexin, which helps us stay awake or fall asleep. They've also found that a receptor called GABAB is responsible for sleep and wakefulness. When this receptor is activated, it helps us fall asleep, and when it's not working right, it can cause problems with sleep. A study using a special medication called baclofen found that it can help people sleep better by activating the GABAB receptor. This shows that there's a link between our genes and our ability to sleep. This has sociocultural implications, because if we inherit a problem with the GABAB receptor, it could affect our sleep and make it hard for us to focus on everyday tasks.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), which is a pretty complex topic. So, to start, let's break it down: CAPD is basically how well the brain uses the sounds it hears. It's a weird way to put it, but essentially, the brain can't process what we hear in a normal way. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but it's like their brain's sound-decoding skills are a bit wonky. It's not about not being able to hear, it's about how the brain takes what we hear and turns it into something that makes sense.\n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first started noticing that some kids with speech problems had trouble processing sounds. A team of Italian researchers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, started working on tests for these kids in 1954, and in 1961, a researcher named Kimura came up with a way to understand how the brain handles sounds. This all led to a big conference in 1977 that got more people interested in studying CAPD.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of different ways: someone with CAPD might have trouble pinpointing where sounds are coming from, or might get confused when there are multiple sounds happening at once. They might also struggle to recognize patterns in sounds, or tell when someone's being sarcastic, or block out one sound if another sound comes after it. It's like their brain's sound-sorting system is a bit messed up. They might also have trouble making sense of sounds in a way that they can use them in real life, or figuring out the order of sounds.\n\nSo, to figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors and specialists use a bunch of different tests to see how they respond to sounds. This can include watching how they behave when they're listening, or asking them questions and seeing how they react. There's no single test that's super reliable, and nobody really knows what causes CAPD. The tests usually involve playing a bunch of sounds at the same time and asking the person to pick out specific ones, or recording the sounds in their ear and seeing how their brain responds.",

Some people might not even get mad if they figure out you've been lying, but others will definitely be super ticked off.\n\nThe whole idea of dressing up as the opposite sex gets even more complicated because it makes you wonder why anyone would want to change who they are in the first place. Like, why would Viola pretend to be a guy to protect herself from bad people? She says, \"I'll meet a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) She has to pretend to be a guy because she's in a new place and doesn't want to get hurt. But by doing that, she ends up losing her support system and even makes people think she's a different person, like Sebastian. Olivia totally falls for her, and Viola also has to deal with some weird feelings for Orsino. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) It's all pretty weird.\n\nSome people might see Twelfth Night as a way to explore how pretending to be someone else can help you figure out your true feelings. Like, Olivia and Orsino might be hiding something, and Viola's disguise is like a wake-up call for them. The way they react to Viola makes you wonder if they were really attracted to her as a guy or if they were just freaked out by their own feelings. It's like Shakespeare is poking fun at people who judge others based on how they look. Olivia is totally shallow, because she goes from loving Cesario to loving Sebastian without even a second thought, and then just thinks of Viola as a sister. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial empire was known for its brutality, especially in the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing it as just that doesn't do it justice. The empire was all over the map in terms of policies and ruling styles, like its geography. Different colonies had different approaches to education too. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that the locals were already pretty educated and literate. German education efforts in Kamerun and other colonies got some positive reviews from the time.\n\nBut German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was a whole different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government set up schools and was really involved in teaching the locals, they pretty much left education to missionary groups who didn't get a lot of support from the government. The government did invest in educating Europeans living there, though - they set up their own schools and really helped out the missionary schools. These decisions had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population was basically uneducated and illiterate. It's not like one single thing caused this difference, though - it was a bunch of social, political, and economic factors that made South West Africa's experience unique.\n\nThere's actually a lot of research out there about education in the German colonies, but most of it is in German and was written a long time ago. Early studies were mainly just describing the educational systems in each colony. Later studies in English did some cool comparisons between different colonies and really dug deep into the details. One of the most important studies on this topic is Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen looked at how the two colonies were similar and different and figured out some of the reasons behind those differences. According to Cohen, the fact that there were so many settlers in South West Africa explains a lot about the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a pretty good climate, considering it's mostly desert, so there were a lot of Europeans living there by 1913 - almost 15,000, which is way more than in East Africa. The settlers in South West Africa were actually pretty lucky to be living in a place with a relatively nice climate.",
            "Heavy Metal music has evolved a ton over the past century, and it's hard to even try to list all the genres. To make things even more complicated, most of these genres have spawned sub and sub-sub genres. It's crazy to think about how far it's come, especially considering that the sub-genre of Heavy Metal has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. This is because it shows a wide range of emotions, although they tend to lean towards the darker side. People started to realize that Heavy Metal had real flexibility and took advantage of it to create their own sub-genre, followed by sub-sub-genres, and it just keeps going.\n\nNowadays, we're at a point where there are so many niches of groups that it's hard to figure out what Heavy Metal even is. It's incorporated so many themes from other genres, but it all started somewhere. To understand the Metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta know what the Metal movement is and why it's a movement, not just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is basically a movement defined by darkness. It's like, more of everything - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatrics. It's way less about being raw and basic; in Metal bands, people are super skilled at playing their instruments, and that comes through in the music. Plus, Metal is a movement that's super influenced by drugs - the psychedelic boom in the '70s got people pretty wild, and that's when some of the craziest, otherworldly records started coming out. It's got all these dark, visceral qualities that were new to the music scene because most popular music was all about being happy and light. Later generations of Metal took some of their influence from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Some lyrics, like these from Helter Skelter, show just how dark Metal can get. It's like the Beatles' darker side, all about ups and downs, kinda like being on drugs. Some people even consider this song to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs ever. It was a response to the Rolling Stones, who were also getting darker and heavier with their music. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy, so they put this song on The White Album.",
            "It's pretty cool to think that before the Surrealists were making their dreamy art, Henri Rousseau was actually living his own dream, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a painting he made in 1910, shows a woman who's in awe of the cool stuff she's seeing in her dreamland, but it also represents Rousseau's own goals as an artist. He had been hoping to get recognized by other artists and art lovers for a long time, but he was stuck with a weird problem: should he try to fit in with the art world by copying other artists, or be true to himself and do his own thing? The Dream is like his masterpiece that shows how he struggled with this for his whole career – wanting to be accepted by the art world he loved, but also wanting to be different and make his own unique art.\n\nTo really get what The Dream is all about, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His dad was a tinsmith who was pretty successful, but Rousseau never got any formal art training – he just worked a regular job until he was 40. People even started calling him a customs inspector, but that's not what he really did (Shattuck 46). When his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their babies, Rousseau was left with a ton of grief and a young daughter, Julia. He started painting to help him deal with the pain and move on. Unlike some other artists of his time, Rousseau wasn't all about painting the perfect peasant scene – he was just a regular guy with regular hopes and dreams.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Rousseau wanted to fit in with the art world – he was starting from scratch, and he was working with some really talented artists who were already famous. He didn't get recognized until around the same time that Matisse was making a name for himself. As author Jan Gordon pointed out in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were different in a lot of ways – not just in their art style, but also why they made art in the first place. While Matisse was all about not being boring, Rousseau just wanted to make art that was good enough to get him into the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "You know, people have been saying for ages that there's a deep connection between how we think about right and wrong, and how we think about what's beautiful and what's not. I'm convinced that there's a reason for this. As John Keats so wisely put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we learn in life comes from school or through our experiences, but somehow, we naturally know what's beautiful and what's the right thing to do, even if no one taught us. Both ethics and aesthetics are all about explaining why something is beautiful or right, rather than telling us how to decide what's good art or good behavior. \n\nIn other words, when we talk about why we like a particular painting, or why we think a certain action is the right thing to do, we can't really put our finger on it. A conversation about the Mona Lisa might go on and on about its lighting or the culture behind it, but ultimately, that doesn't capture what makes it so great. When someone asks you about your favorite book or piece of art, you often end up saying \"There's just something about it\" before trying to come up with a more thoughtful explanation. I think that both art and morality have this quality to them - they can't be fully explained by just listing their good qualities. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Even if we try to describe a book in detail, there's something more to it that we can't quite put into words. I think that this is true for ethics too - as Ludwig Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think that this \"something\" - this intangible quality - is what makes art and morality so powerful, and that it's what connects them.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are closely related because we experience them in a way that's hard to explain. They affect us on a deep level, but we can't quite put into words. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature - as McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are not as relevant to other arts, like music, but they seem to be just as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's got this amazing vibe going on right now, it's like a super strong country with its own unique culture that you can feel all the way from the Alps in München down to the Baltic sea city of Kiel.  You can sense it in Köln on the Rhine, in the middle of the country, and even in the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany's culture is a mix of different sources and tribes, considering how it all came together. \n\nGermania is basically the ancestral land of the Germans, but where the name actually came from is still up for debate among scholars. Some think it's from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, or even from a previous name for the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. Julius Caesar was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he took it from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between the ones he'd conquered and the ones he hadn't. He wrote in his first book, \"Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, are always at war with the Gauls. They fight the Germans almost every day.\" Others believe it might mean \"spear\" from the Old English word ger, or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, which means \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were super loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" around AD 98 that the Germans were aboriginal and not mixed with other races. He said, \"Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, let alone Germany, with its harsh climate, gloomy skies, and sullen people?\" It's pretty obvious the Romans wouldn't be interested in moving there, at least not yet. They'd send out their conquests to Germania to trade and occasionally lead a land campaign, but they'd mostly stay in their empire. The Germanic tribes started showing up around the first century, living on the Roman Empire's borders, trading their goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood there staring blankly at the scene before me, my mind a complete blank slate.  I just couldn't seem to grasp anything about it, like it was just a bunch of random stuff I was looking at.  My thoughts were zipping in and out of my brain too fast for me to catch them.  I was like a total robot, just processing the image without really thinking about it.\n\nI had been wanting to learn how to draw for ages, ever since I was six.  Then I got this art book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and it totally changed everything.  It teaches you all these crazy cool techniques like how to break down a picture into simple shapes and stuff.  One trick it shows you is to frame a picture with a square, which makes it way easier to draw.  But at that moment, I was so overwhelmed by the whole thing that I just couldn't even think about framing it.  I was stuck, just staring at the picture in awe.\n\nI've always been fascinated by artists who create masterpieces with crazy styles, like Picasso with his blue phase or Monet with his greenery.  If I wanted to be an artist, I figured this was my chance to make something special – I'd call it Work in Brown.  I picked up my pencil, my hand started moving, and for a second, I felt like I was totally in the zone.  But then I had to go and mess it up by trying to, ahem, take care of a little business...  My hand smacked the toilet handle, but the, um, 'present' refused to budge.  I was stuck staring at this gross brown package that someone had left behind.  I grabbed the mop, frowning, trying to get my mind off the situation.  A few more flushes, a few more minutes of me standing there, then I finally managed to get my hand into the toilet and...well, let's just say it was a real challenge.",
            "Teenage drivers are dying behind the wheel in alarming numbers.  Several factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  According to the National Institutes of Health, a big part of the problem is that the teen brain just isn't ready for the risks of driving.  Inexperience is another major factor – it not only causes more fatal accidents, but also increases the rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  And, as anyone can guess, teens often drive with their friends – which is a deadly combo.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the more underage passengers, the higher the risk of traffic accidents.\n\nCalifornia and some other states have tried to make teens safer by requiring temporary licenses that limit their driving hours and ban other minors as passengers.  But these provisional licenses are just a temporary fix.  The real issue is that, as a group, teen drivers are just not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Researcher Marvin Zuckerman thinks that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, and he's got the stats to back it up.  A common trait among teens is the desire to take risks for the thrill of it, so it makes sense to delay driving until they're a bit older.  If we keep giving out driver's licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing deadly accidents happen, and the death toll will skyrocket in the next few years.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will hit the road, and the situation could get even more serious.\n\nLegislation to deal with this issue would be pretty straightforward.  Schools could still teach driver's education classes to get future drivers started, but no one under 18 could drive.  A provisional permit could still be issued before a full license, and a certain number of driving hours would still be required.  The number of hours could be based on the number already required in most states (in California, for example, that's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with a grown-up).  Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea's not new, but it's still worth considering.",
            "So I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's film collection and decided to check out the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were a total of 15 of these films, and I watched them all. Trick films use creative editing to create illusions, so I focused on analyzing the style and evolution of these early films. Most of them are pretty straightforward - they're set-bound, shot in a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and stick to the one shot equals one film rule. However, some of the later films broke free from these rules by introducing new ideas like multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was how all the trick films share the same set-up: they're all shot on a static set within a frontal proscenium. The camera stays in one place and doesn't follow the action. This style came from the theatre and, for trick films, the magic shows and vaudeville acts of the time. A big limitation of this style is that the actors can only move side-to-side, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Check out Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) for an example - the actors enter from the right and just bop back and forth across the screen.\n\nThese films also tend to use a lot of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. They never use close-ups, just like in the theatre and vaudeville days when the whole performance would be visible on stage. The actors stay in the middle ground and don't move towards the camera, so the audience never gets a close-up shot. Most of these early trick films are pretty short, lasting only a minute or so, because they follow the rule of one conceptual shot equals one film. This limits what they can do, so most of them are just simple tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, look closer at a film like The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) and you'll see that the physical shot and the conceptual shot aren't always the same thing - sometimes a single shot is made up of multiple physical shots to create an illusion.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was super into the idea of Republicanism and was always speaking his mind about personal freedom and government. As a farmer, his job and his short stint in politics made him known for being outspoken and dedicated. His love for the country life influenced just about all his thoughts on government, especially when it came to how a system should work. He thought that preserving and supporting agriculture was the key to making good arguments about things like power, rules, and the courts.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to create the perfect system because nobody was stuck in the past and telling them what to do. This meant that they could make a system where people had control over themselves. He was all about the natural rights of people, and he thought that they're all connected - if one of them gets taken away, the others get hurt too, and they're not as valuable. He thought that these rights should be off-limits to the government. He said that the \"state of nature\" was basically a world where the strong and mean people get ahead, but in a civilized society, that's not how it should be.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought that the government had to be created so that it accounted for both the good and bad in people. He was super strict about his ideas on right and wrong being two separate things. He said that since governments are run by people, they'll have all the good and bad qualities that come with being human. He thought that good principles were about protecting private property, helping farmers, and keeping capitalism in check. He believed that a government with good principles would work fairly no matter who was in charge, even if they were mostly looking out for themselves. He thought that people are self-centered, but that's not always a bad thing - it's only bad when it hurts others. A good government was needed to keep people's bad qualities in check, and it had to be watched closely to make sure it didn't add any bad principles.\n\nLike many other strong Republicans back then, Taylor wanted the government to stick to the Constitution and not do anything that wasn't clearly said in it. He thought that a big government was expensive and likely to be super controlling. However, he also thought that just following the words without thinking about what the writers meant could be really bad. He even thought that the Declaration of Independence was like the true guide for the United States because it made it clear that we're a group of states, not one single country.",
            "Going back to the data in Figure 17, we saw a drastic drop in commuter log entries during the third month of the project. That was pretty discouraging, and it wasn't easy to figure out why it happened. Winter was in full swing at our New England campus, which probably contributed to the decline in bicycle and foot traffic. Also, December signals the end of the fall semester, so people were busy wrapping up schoolwork and finals, and the commuter log might have slipped their minds. To make things worse, it's the start of the holiday season, and students and faculty get a month-long break, which means many people didn't even need to come to campus. As for January, classes resumed in late January, but I'm not sure if that's related to the low log submissions for that month. What really puzzles me, though, is why the submissions remained low in February. Maybe it's just the natural life cycle of a project - everyone gets excited at first, and then things die down. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special push to reinvigorate the project, which did lead to a surge in log submissions that month. So, we faced the tough challenge of keeping the project going despite a natural dip in interest, compounded by the semester and holiday breaks that come with higher education.\n\nAnother hurdle we faced (and any commuting project will, I guess) is that people really love their freedom, independence, and the flexibility of driving. It's a deep-seated part of our culture. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we needed to offer some serious incentives. We gave out gift cards to local spots, but it would have been cool to see how bigger prizes, like a new bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car, would have affected participation. That might have helped us combat that initial dip in engagement. The prizes we offered didn't change, though - if we had announced some bigger prizes, like a bike in December and a car in January, I bet it would have made a difference.",
            "I just learned about Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs for short, and they're pretty cool.  They're like index funds but way more flexible and you can buy and sell them like stocks.  You get the good stuff about index funds like diversification, but you also get the benefits of owning individual stocks, like being able to short sell and buy on margin.  Plus, you can buy just one share, which is pretty sweet.  But the best part is that ETFs are way cheaper than the average mutual fund.  The only downside is that you have to pay a commission when you trade them, just like with stocks.  There are tons of different ETFs out there, so it's up to you to figure out which ones are the best.  In this case, we're looking at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning just those stocks is better than owning the whole ETF.  We're only looking at the top 10 because it would be crazy to try to analyze every single holding.  These 10 stocks make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets, so it's a good representation.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the whole ETF, we're going to use some math to calculate their Beta and Return.  If we had a portfolio made up of just these 10 stocks, how would it compare to the whole ETF?  The chart shows that if we just owned the top 10 stocks, our portfolio would be 16% higher in returns and have a lower Beta than the ETF.  That sounds like a pretty good deal!  But before we get too excited, we need to make sure that these results are actually significant.  To do that, we're going to look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF's standard deviation.  If the two are different, then we can say that the results are statistically significant.",
            "Dream-Land is one of Edgar Allan Poe's top poems, and he thought it was his best work. In this poem, you'll find the word \"Thulé\" popping up in lines 6 and 56 - it was a term that Poe got from Virgil, or so says Mabbott. Virgil used it to refer to an island north of Britain that the Greeks thought was the edge of the known world. However, there's another source that might be responsible for Poe's use of the term. Poe was really into German writers, and one of his favorites was Goethe.\n\nThis is important because it shows how familiar Poe was with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt, in his book about Poe and Goethe, thinks that Poe copied some of his ideas from Goethe's writing. The Oxford Companion to English Literature says that Goethe was a big deal in the literary world for his poetic drama Faust, which came out in two parts, first in 1808 and again in 1832, the year Goethe died. Inside Faust's second part is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\", which is all about a king whose wife dies after giving him a fancy goblet. The king gets super drunk, cries a lot, and decides it's time to die too. He gives away his stuff to his kids, except the goblet, and then walks off a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and checks out. The King of Thulé is a bit like the king in Dream-Land, maybe even a dark twin of Poe's struggles with loss and drinking. Goethe's Faust was even adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his writing, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again in \"Dream-Land\", where he uses it as the opening and closing lines for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are kind of like two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place where he's haunted by dead friends and sees a world without color. This is similar to how Goethe's king feels after losing his wife - he's all alone, lost his will to live, and is just going through the motions. It's like Poe is stepping into Goethe's poem and describing it from his own perspective.\n\nGoethe was a big deal in the literary world, and Poe would have known about him for sure because of his respect for Tennyson. Poe even said that he admired Tennyson. Poe would've also been exposed to Goethe's work through all the reproductions that were happening after the original publication.",
            "Is it possible that a customer would get punitive damages in court after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store because the manager was eating dinner instead of cleaning up the mess, even though he'd been told twice about it? Probably not, but a judge wouldn't immediately dismiss the claim. To win punitive damages, the customer would have to prove that the manager was being super reckless and didn't care about the harm that could happen, which is called \"despicable\" in the law. This customer can argue that the manager should have known how bad it would be if he didn't clean up the spill because a bunch of people had already slipped and fallen in the same store just a few months ago, and he still did nothing. It's not a super strong argument, but it makes sense given that six people had slipped and fallen in the store in 2009 and the manager didn't do anything about it. \n\nOn October 13th, an employee told the manager about the spill, but the manager said he was too busy eating dinner to deal with it. Another employee reminded him about 15 minutes later, and he said the same thing. Then, at 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt pretty badly. Before that accident, there had been five other slip-and-fall incidents in the same store in 2009. Now the customer is suing the store for money because of her injury and we're thinking about filing a motion to get the court to toss out the part of the lawsuit that wants punitive damages.\n\nIn California, you can get punitive damages if someone did something really bad on purpose or was super reckless and didn't care about hurting others. The law says that's called \"malice,\" and it means either intentionally causing harm or doing something super bad that you knew could hurt someone, and then going ahead and doing it anyway. In one case, a court said that's exactly what happened when someone knew something was going to be super bad, but they still chose to do it and hurt someone.",
            "About four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC, which got me thinking about a really big question: is Islam a hostile religion?  To be honest, I think this question is more relevant now than ever, especially when you look back at what's happened since 9/11.  From what I've observed, the media's view of Islam has gone from pretty negative to extremely tolerant in the US.  It's crazy to think that back in 2001, a presidential candidate with Islamic ties, like Barack Obama, would have been a total long shot.\n\nThe Story of the Prophet really caught my attention.  This biography of Muhammad conflicts with what I thought I knew about him.  I used to think that Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam, but the story presents him as a totally different guy - a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled by others.  People started to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out one by one.  It's weird to see how the biography is written in a way that makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, just live his life and let the miracles speak for themselves.  This kind of writing is actually misleading because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  It's like they're taking credit for Jesus' life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nI also noticed that the biography tries to show how people converted to Islam on their own, but the stories are all second- or third-hand.  It's like they're trying to prove the truth of the stories, but it makes them seem suspicious.  The thing that really gets me is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect guy who's humble, endearing, wise, and gentle, but history says the opposite.  It's hard not to wonder if Muslims today really know the truth behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Christianity's roots and the actual teachings of Jesus got lost in the shuffle as the faith evolved after his death.  If we look at it in big picture terms, we can see how Christianity drifted further and further away from its original ideas.  Nowadays, it seems like there's a growing awareness and a more progressive mindset.  Traditionalists might resist any changes, but they might not be influential enough to hold things back.  As time goes on, people will become more aware of the history of Christianity, and a desire will grow to separate the added stuff from what Jesus really taught.  It might take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable:  There will be a big reversal in Christianity's history, and it will return to its original form.  A movement will grow, and it'll strip away all the extra layers of doctrine, kind of like the clock turning backward, until all you're left with is Jesus' original message.  When this trend hits the US and Europe, it'll spread like wildfire, and people will start following Jesus' ideas like it's the 1st century all over again.  The church as an institution will still be strong, but because people will be going back to the basics, there'll be more similarity between different groups and regions, rather than differences.  History is full of examples of reversals - just think about how the Roman Empire used to hate Christians, but later they took over the empire.  Our country went from having African-American slaves to having African-American leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity, and it'll be a big reversal of history as people search for the source.  It's crucial to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors, not literal statements, for this to happen.  So what's been added to Christianity since Jesus' time?\n\nIf we go way back in time, we see only Judaism, the root of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all part of the Jewish faith.  But the Jewish people weren't a single unit - they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common folk.",
            "I think The Jungle really shows the darker side of human nature. People, deep down, are super selfish and only care about themselves. They just want to live the best life possible and don't worry about anyone else. The Jungle shows this in lots of ways. The owners and bosses of the big factories are the most obvious example. All they care about is making their companies huge and awesome, no matter who gets hurt or what gets in their way. They don't care about the pollution they're creating or the animals and people getting hurt because of it. Upton Sinclair does a great job of painting a picture of how bad it is with his words, like when he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's showing how much damage they're causing and how the owners don't care about anyone or anything getting hurt. They're just all about the money.\n\nThe bosses and owners also didn't care about their workers who were making them rich. They would do anything to save a buck, like, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They made their workers work super long hours and then would lay off huge groups of people without any warning or help. Back then, there weren't many laws to protect workers' safety or well-being, so the bosses and owners were basically in charge and could do whatever they wanted. They expected the workers to just deal with the terrible conditions they were living and working in, and there were no organizations to help them. The unions that formed were more of a problem because they made money off the workers. It was like the workers were slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery\".",
            "A lot of authors are really good at making readers feel a certain way about important topics. They use different techniques to do this, but some are way more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master at this in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs up words that don't usually go together to give readers a certain vibe about a subject. Other times, he gives a symbol meaning and then uses it for the same thing. Fitzgerald does this with lots of colors, like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for some of these colors, like white and gray, and then uses that meaning to make readers feel a certain way about important objects.\n\nFitzgerald uses the technique of giving meaning to colors and then using them to make readers feel something in a big way with white and gray. He makes white mean something fancy and high class, while gray is more old and faded. He sets this up at the start of the novel by using both colors all the time. Everyone's always wearing white - Daisy and Jordan are \"in white\" all the time (8), and even guys like Nick and Tom are wearing white too: Nick's got \"white flannels\" (41) for Gatsby's party, and Tom's wearing a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle. Even Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick's describing Gatsby's party, and the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald takes it to the next level by using these colors to describe boring, everyday things: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56) on his way to work, and the names of people at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. He even describes ordinary people and places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27). After Fitzgerald gets this meaning across, he uses white and gray to make readers see certain subjects as unimportant or just part of a crowd. This starts with Daisy. After a while without using these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74), and readers start to see her as just a uniform thing that Gatsby wants and longs for. He uses more of this technique around Daisy to make her seem like just a uniform addition, for example, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she's again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a super productive agricultural hotspot thanks to its amazing climate. It's all sunshine and mild vibes here. You can grow all sorts of tasty crops like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a huge demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the area, with many local groups having crazy long waiting lists. People are totally into organic eggs and milk too. Some of these organic farms even offer tours, hiking trails, and birdwatching spots, which is a win-win for the landowner and the environment. This kind of setup lets them tap into government programs that benefit both the farmer and the wildlife. It's like killing two birds with one stone.\n\nOrganic farming has its perks, like a more diverse range of plants and wildlife in the area because there are no yucky chemicals in the soil and water. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Organic farming can be way more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming. You have to spend more time and effort removing pests and weeds and fertilizing the soil without using harsh chemicals. And, let's be real, organic farms often have higher losses and are way less efficient than big commercial operations. On top of that, some beneficial practices that help wildlife, like planting cover crops and removing invasive species, can be super time-consuming and costly. So, it's no wonder the landowner in this scenario might be looking for some financial help or expert advice to maximize both their profits and wildlife-friendly practices.\n\nThe land I'm talking about is a 160-acre plot near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. This land is in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still a work in progress, but it currently covers over a hundred plant and animal species, including some that are super rare and endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and might be listed as endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land has been home to Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and wood sellers in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing and wood production for a while. I chose this piece of land from a real estate website and did some research on government programs that might help a small farmer like this one reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly practices. I even found an organic farm in the same area that I used as a model for what this landowner might try to achieve.",
            "When it comes to negotiation, culture plays a huge role. Culture isn't something that can be defined by just a few words, and it's not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing. It's the opposite of what you might think it is, and it's often different from what you might expect. For example, saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are super accommodating\" is way too broad and doesn't really capture the full picture. What's more helpful to a negotiator is understanding what a culture's values and attitudes are, and how they might impact the negotiation. When you're dealing with a culture that's different from your own, you end up comparing it to your own culture, and that's when things can get pretty relatable. \n\nTrying to understand a foreign culture or mindset can be a real challenge. It might involve studying its history or figuring out its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, you should just accept it for what it is and work with it, especially when you're in a tough bargaining position. And even if you're the one who's visiting someone else's turf, showing respect for their traditions and values can really help you get past any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nBut here's the thing: culture isn't just about national differences. Even within the same country, companies can have their own unique corporate cultures. For example, some companies might value long hours in the office, while others are way more relaxed. You can see evidence of this in things like dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. And let me tell you, American corporate culture is all over the map - some companies are super formal, while others are super casual. It's like you need to dig deeper to really understand what's going on.\n\nValues are even more important to get a handle on, because they're like the underlying reason why a culture is the way it is. If a culture values things like saving face or communal harmony, you can bet that a negotiator from that culture won't be willing to publicly shame their company or their boss to get a good deal. On the other hand, if a culture values getting a hard bargain, you won't see the negotiator settling for anything less than the best deal possible. So, it's really helpful to consider these kinds of things before you sit down at the negotiation table. And, if you can, it's even better to get to know your opponent on a personal level - it can really make the negotiation go more smoothly.",
            "The quote 'There is no God' isn't a phrase you'd hear from St. Anselm or St. Thomas Aquinas. That's a line from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and it's where Anselm starts his argument for the existence of God. This belief is also shared by Thomas Aquinas. Since their arguments are both in defense of the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both right, and we'll compare them later. To keep things simple, we'll only talk about their arguments for the God of the Bible. If we were to consider other types of gods, it wouldn't let us fairly compare their ideas. \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's assume both Anselm and Aquinas are correct in their belief in God. We'll show that, even though they bring up valid points, neither of them provides a complete basis for believing in God.\n\nTo get started, let's look at Anselm's argument. He thinks you can find proof of God by looking within yourself. He claims that because we can imagine God, we can't imagine that he doesn't exist. His idea is hard to put into words, but basically, he says that proof for God is already inside our minds. He thinks we don't need to look outside ourselves for the truth about God; we just need to think about what we already know is true. This idea of trusting in something without concrete evidence is, in Christian texts, called faith.\n\nAnselm's idea is different from Aquinas's. Aquinas thinks you can prove the existence of God using logic and facts, without needing any faith. This would be helpful in spreading Christianity, because new followers wouldn't need to accept something they can't prove. They could be convinced by logic alone. Aquinas uses five different logical arguments to prove God's existence: change, causation, being in a state of uncertainty, degrees of excellence, and how things fit together. In each one, he's saying that God must exist because it makes sense logically. Imagine you're trying to complete a puzzle, and someone tells you that you're missing one piece. You can figure out what the missing piece looks like just by looking at the rest of the puzzle.",
            "So, I'm learning about ancient times – like, a really long time ago, over 2,500 years ago. It was around the fifth or sixth century BCE, and a dude who would eventually be called Buddha was born. This guy renounced the world, became enlightened, and started teaching his ideas, which eventually led to the creation of Buddhism, specifically the Theravada branch. If you think back to when Buddha was alive, it was definitely different from how it is now. For instance, Sri Lanka has this super old tradition where they celebrate this water-cutting ceremony, but Buddha never actually taught about anything like that. It's pretty cool how the religion has changed over time – not just some superficial stuff, but also the core ideas that Buddhism is built on.\n\nThere are some important terms that I'll be using a lot in this discussion. When I say internal, I mean something that's inside the Buddhist community – like, it's not from outsiders, but from people who are actually a part of it. External means something that's coming from outside the community. Hostile means it's trying to hurt the community, even if it's not necessarily a bad thing. And benign means it's not trying to harm or help the community, even if it accidentally does one or the other. These terms will show up a lot.\n\nFirst off, I need to break down the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in this thing called the Triple Gem – it's like the Buddha, the teachings (Dhamma), and the community (Sangha). The Dhamma is basically the Buddhist texts, which are divided into three groups. The Sutta Pitaka has the sayings of Buddha, the Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper stuff about the meaning of life, like no soul (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and how everything is temporary (Anicca). If you understand these ideas, you can stop going through this cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara), and you can also get rid of desire (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha). The Vinaya Pitaka also gives rules for monks and laypeople, like the five precepts (no killing, lying, stealing, misbehaving, or getting drunk). Monks have way more rules to follow. One of the most important ideas in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico are like two countries that used to hate each other for a super long time - 57 whole years (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The worst part of their rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 when the US basically defeated Mexico and took Texas and the American Southwest (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). They had a bunch of other clashes too, but it all finally settled down just before World War I. I guess it's like what happens when two neighbors can't agree on stuff. It's the same with lots of countries who have a border with another country - they often disagree on big things like money, culture, and stuff (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nIt's not like the US and Mexico are the only ones with a long-standing rivalry - lots of countries with a shared border have similar problems. David M. Pletcher (1977) said that Mexico and Cuba are the only countries where the US has super long-standing diplomatic issues (p. 41). I guess it's because they're close to the US and have been at odds with it for a while. Other countries in Latin America have gotten along pretty well with the US.\n\nIt turns out that the US and Mexico didn't get along because of some pretty deep-seated issues - it's like they had a major disagreement about what to believe in. Sally Frahm (2001) said that back in the day, Americans were super opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). It's kinda like how the US and the Soviet Union didn't get along during the Cold War - they had some big ideological differences. But with the US and Mexico, it was more about their different religions. This whole thing started because the US and Mexico inherited some bad feelings from their former colonial rulers (the English and Spanish).\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted 17 times when the US and Mexico disagreed over 57 years. Most of these disagreements were about border stuff, like when Mexican bandits would cross over into the US, or when American outlaws would cause trouble in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). It wasn't until the US and Mexico both started cracking down on their borders that things started to get better.\n\nSchmitt (1974) said that things started to calm down when Mexico realized it needed the US a lot more (p. 109), and the US stopped trying to expand its territory and started focusing on helping Mexico out financially (p. 110).",
            "It's been 15 years since an illness I never even knew existed suddenly turned my life upside down and left me disabled. I was 46 at the time, working as a nurse, and had chosen the profession to escape feelings of uncertainty from my childhood. I was constantly told, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" but that didn't live up to reality. As a result, I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and to be honest, I'm still struggling every day. What keeps me going is the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends - I'm not as strong as I thought I was when disaster struck. \n\nMy point is that no matter how prepared we think we are, life can still throw us curveballs. There are no guarantees, and when the going gets tough, people need each other's help. I agree that we should question our reliance on the government, but instead of building our own shelters, we should be learning to trust and support each other. The idea of rugged individualism that Conservatives talk about isn't entirely accurate - the pioneers who settled the West didn't do it alone; they relied on each other for survival. \n\nWhile being prepared is a good idea, it's just as essential to build relationships with the people around us. I've got my emergency kit ready, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and all the essentials, but I also know that having neighbors who care can make all the difference. If you have the resources, it's great to have a small farm and a wood stove, but what's most important is knowing the people who live next door.",
            "So, what drives organisms to evolve in the way they do? Are there any roadblocks or restrictions that influence the direction of evolutionary change? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said it was like trying to put into mathematical terms even the simplest living things. Fast forward to now, and we're still scratching our heads - but, we've been using math to help us understand certain parts of mollusk shell development through both how they grow and how they evolved over time (think Raup and Stanley's work from 1981 as an example). Our project is all about using mathematical modeling of how Prunum develops over time and in its history, combined with some actual experiments, to figure out what's behind the direction and strength of evolutionary changes. We used X-rays of Prunum species to pick out some key stats that we could then use to model different possible and real shell shapes. These numbers got plugged into a computer program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995), and we used it to imagine what shell shapes could be possible. This stuff is being combined with other studies to get a better handle on what's going on in the history of this group of animals.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that's constantly moving through space over time - it's kind of like a journey that's 360 degrees long. The parts of the shell that twist around in a spiral pattern are called whorls, and they're all connected by a line that runs through the center of the shell, called the columella. The speed at which these whorls get bigger can vary, and each one is separated by a line called a suture. In most shells, the biggest whorl is the last one (that's the body whorl). The spire is all the whorls except the last one, and the tip of the spire is the apex, while the other end is the base. The animal pops out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells in different ways, like from the front, back, opening, or from the side that's opposite the opening. Usually, when we look at a shell, it's from the front, with the opening facing us and the pointy end pointing up.\n\nHere's a cool way to count the whorls: first, look at the shell from the front, then find where the first line between two whorls starts. Draw a line between them, and count the whorls from that line - you can even estimate to a quarter of a whorl if you need to.\n\nA shell can also be thought of like a bunch of openings that move through space and time as the animal builds its shell. You can actually track the path of the opening by looking at the center of each whorl's opening, and the horizontal and vertical distance from the center to the edge of the opening. This path can be shown on a graph or mathematically. Once we have the math formula, we can play around with different parameters and see how they affect how the mollusk builds its shell.",
            "I've been going over the facts about neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia, and it's been a real bummer to see that there hasn't been a lot of change in the past ten years.  They're doing okay with some of the Millennium Development Goals, like getting people clean water and a decent bathroom, but when it comes to how well they're doing on child and mom health stuff, they're way behind where they need to be to meet their goals by 2015.  There are a lot of reasons for this, which I'll get into below, and it's pretty clear that they need to beef up their health system instead of just focusing on one-off programs.\n\tFirst off, Indonesia has made some progress with getting more births where a trained health worker is present, but 72% still means that a lot of moms aren't getting the help they need if something goes wrong.  It's like, yeah, more people are getting this, but it's not like it's a guarantee they'll get the care they need.  Plus, the ones who are trained are often just traditional workers, like midwives, who can't handle emergencies.  You can bet that a lot of the deaths are because of things like bleeding during pregnancy, which is a big problem.  So, even though they're getting better at this one thing, there's still lots to work on.  Another area that's a concern is how many kids with diarrhea under five are actually getting help from a health pro, and it's pretty low across the whole country.  They also don't have much data on how well new moms are doing after they give birth, but it's clear that's an issue too.\n\tWhen it comes to C-sections, they're not happening often enough - only about 4% of births are C-sections.  But what's even more worrying is that the rate is way lower in rural areas, at only 2%.  This shows that people in the cities are getting way more access to healthcare than those in the sticks.  It's like they're leaving the poor people behind.  And it gets even worse when you look at how well people in different income groups are using healthcare services - there's a huge gap between the richest and poorest people, and it's almost like they can't afford it.  Clearly, people have to pay out of pocket for healthcare, which is a real problem. \n\tNow, when it comes to figuring out how to fix all this, the main question is whether Indonesia should focus on specific programs or fix the whole health system at once.  On the one hand, targeting one area of healthcare sounds good because it's like, hey, let's get this one thing done and be done with it.  But the problem is that when you put all your eggs in one basket, other areas suffer and people start working on that one thing instead of other important stuff.  Just look at what happened with HIV/AIDS funding - it totally took resources away from family planning.  Plus, having lots of programs going on at the same time just means you end up with a bunch of duplicated and uncoordinated services, which makes it harder to get things done.",
            "Victorian novels are super detailed and often focus on the aristocracy of that time period, but there are two novels that stand out for not following this pattern - Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these novels have a mysterious vibe and a bit of the weird and unusual, which is pretty different from the norm for the Victorian era. This adds depth to the characters and lets us see into their thoughts and feelings. They're not just rich people, they're real people with their own problems and emotions.\n\nI was totally confused, like I was walking around with Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing, and I could hear what they were saying. When I snapped back to reality, I was talking to them, but I didn't know what was going on. Suddenly, loud noises and flashes of light hit me, and I felt like I was being pulled around by some invisible force. It was all a bit fuzzy, but I could feel this gnawing pain that wouldn't go away.\n\n In these two novels, mystery often shows up in dream sequences or dream-like moments, but it's used in different ways. In Oliver Twist, these strange happenings often reveal what's going on inside Oliver's head, what's bothering him, and what he knows about the world around him. When Oliver gets shot in chapter 28, it's like he's reliving it in a dream, as he tries to find help. The scene shows how little control Oliver had over the events unfolding around him, and how desperate he was, as shown through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, and all his senses are numb; he doesn't notice the force that's taking him away, and he feels his fear and pain all over again, but without the shock. This makes us wonder whose fault it is that Oliver's in this situation, since it's definitely not his own. This scene also implies that Oliver's giving up, like he's been broken by Fagin and is just accepting his fate, which affects his ability to make decisions. Otherwise, we'd expect him to try to take action, even if it's just to save himself.\n\nThe day passed by so quickly, like it was just a blur. I mean, it was gone as soon as it started, and then night came back around again - it was so long and silent, but also so short and fleeting.",
            "It's been a couple of years since I worked at an after-school program helping elementary students with their studies, but one kid in particular stuck in my mind. I was assigned to help a little boy named Adrian, who was really struggling with reading. I soon realized something was off; he could pronounce some of the letters perfectly, but others were a complete mystery. It was a weird situation, especially since he spoke perfect English - or so I thought, until I met his mom. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish, and I was struggling to communicate with her, my Spanish skills being pretty basic. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized Adrian was actually reading just fine, but he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. I'm not sure if this revelation made a big difference in his reading, but I hope he's doing okay now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not as straightforward as we think; even kids who speak perfect English can still struggle with reading. I'm sure everyone agrees that this is a problem, so what's the solution? For Adrian, the answer was simple: extra help with the English alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's much more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these things on their own will fix the problem. The key is to combine them all.\n\nFirst off, the dual language system is a great idea that benefits not just kids who speak Spanish at home, but all kids. Studies have shown that kids in two-way bilingual education programs perform better academically. There's a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we implemented these programs in every classroom, all kids would benefit. So, how do we make it happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unfair. But we could definitely have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our teachers and students.",
            "Most of us learn from a young age that there's something greater than ourselves out there, something that's hard to fully comprehend.  Some people go to church, temple, or find their own inner answers.  Many accept the faith passed down from our parents, while others reject it and think there's nothing beyond our own understanding.  We might start with one set of values, only to change our minds later and adopt another.  Whatever path we take, we're on a journey to figure out who we are through our own unique take on spirituality.  We're searching for a guiding light to lead us out of the darkness.\n\nMy dad told me his favorite bird was cardinals when I asked him.  We were sitting on the porch, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof while we smoked our cigarettes.  The rain pouring down was drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, like he was half thinking, half remembering something.  He'd lost weight and his clothes hung loose on him.  His hair had gotten thinner, too.  He kept staring at the rain, avoiding eye contact.  I felt scared, alone, and didn't know how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him without making it feel more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain during that June twilight.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had only prolonged his suffering; I couldn't figure out what the point of that was.  If there was a God, I wondered, had he stopped listening to me a long time ago?  I said no prayers that night, alone in the darkness. \n\nI didn't want to watch him die.  I didn't want to see my creator slip away.  I wanted to remember my dad for how he lived, not how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone else, better than his family.  I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him go.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is basically a contradiction in terms, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel - \"an oxymoron for 'Old-New'.\" The Gothic genre's been getting a bad rap, but it's also been praised for evoking the 'terrible sublime.' People have accused it of being shallow, but others have argued that it's actually pretty deep. The very first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, took elements from old romances and modern novels and mashed them together to create something entirely new. Walpole called it \"A Gothic Story\" and it was a game-changer in terms of literary expression. The Gothic genre is all about throwing back to medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time The Castle of Otranto came out, the word \"gothic\" was already being used to describe a bunch of different things - people, styles, and time periods. It was seen as outdated and unsophisticated compared to the modern world. But the combination of Gothic flair and the new way novels were written (giving readers a more personal look at the characters' psyches) is what's kept the Gothic genre around for so long and made it both old and new to readers.\n\nOne of the most important Gothic ideas in these novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, which involves training a proper knight, is both carried over and altered in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is a big deal for Gothic writers because it represents the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and they saw a lack of that ideal in their own society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the Gothic past gets idealized and romanticized (which hints at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic). Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of political turmoil and was worried about the future. He thought that the supposed morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in his own society. This idea is clear in characters like Frederic. When we meet him, he's already shown to embody many chivalric traits - he's a prince, he's been through tragedy, and he's supposed to have been killed by infidels. The image of the gallant and courteous knight is exaggerated, which brings the Gothic trope of excess into play.",
            "Supply chain management is like a crazy rollercoaster of goods moving from the customer's order to raw materials, production, and finally to the customer's hands. It all started back in 1982 when Keith Oliver, a super cool consultant, came up with the term supply chain management. He basically described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers quickly and efficiently. It's like a puzzle with six key pieces: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These six elements work together to give customers the best service ever.\n\nOkay, let's dive into the first piece of the puzzle: production. It's like the foundation of the whole supply chain thing. Production is where everything starts, and it's all about figuring out when, why, where, and how to produce the goods. Managers need to know what customers want, and they can find out by checking out the market. The market is like the ultimate indicator of what customers are looking for. Once they've analyzed the market and understand customer demand, they're ready to decide what products to produce, how many to make, and where to make them. They've got to consider customer satisfaction and demand, or it's gonna be a disaster.\n\nFor example, when I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, they had these super detailed booklets and processes for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. It was like a well-oiled machine, and it helped them work smoothly without any confusion. \n\nThe second key element is supply. It's all about making strategic decisions that determine what a company can do and who they can partner with. A company might have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers need to decide which division is best for each process, or they might outsource the work to other companies to save money and increase flexibility. The goal is to create velocity – providing quality, flexibility, and low costs all at the same time.",
            "There's a sign that reads 'Hitler is alive in Burma.' If you believe that, you're probably as clueless as I am. I just saw this chick from Juno standing on a street corner with a sign that said the same thing. I'm guessing she just got it from the bottom of a shoebox of crap ideas. Burma's like a country in Southeast Asia that's got a pretty bad government. They took over in 1962 and have been a bunch of tyrants ever since. There was this huge protest in 2007, it was like, the first big one in years. These Buddhist monks were at the front of it, and they all wore orange robes. It became known as 'The Saffron Revolution.' The government was all cool with the monks at first, but then things took a dark turn and it was like a war or something. The government was going after the monks, invading their monasteries, and arresting journalists. One Japanese dude got killed just for being there. I don't know the exact number of people who died, but some guy who used to be in the army said it's way more than they're saying.\n\nThis stuff's not new, though. Governments have been trying to shut down anyone who disagrees with them for as long as humans have been around. Like, the ancient Romans thought their rulers were gods. In Japan, the emperor is actually thought to be a god or whatever. And don't even get me started on George W. Bush's buddies with that dude from Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nThere are some pretty crazy examples of this stuff. Like that time in Tiananmen Square in 1989. It was like a huge protest against the Chinese government and they killed a bunch of people. The Chinese government says 200-300 died, but other people say it was way more like 2,000-3,000. Then there was the Rwandan genocide, where these Hutu militias were just killing Tutsis and anyone else they didn't like. And don't forget about Hitler's thing with the Jews. It's all pretty messed up.",
            "So, Duke Ellington's influence on jazz was pretty much due to his staying power and his ability to get his orchestra sounding just right. Most of the time, his piano parts in the songs picked for this assignment are pretty subtle, but as a composer, Ellington was a pro at creating super intricate and complex pieces that made each band member shine. He built the foundation for the band to improvise and also wrote super tight pieces that fit each person's style. This way, he made the entire orchestra sound really cool and unique for each song. Ellington was a master at figuring out how each player sounded and how they fit together, which allowed him to make some of the most awesome and groundbreaking jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Groove Music dictionary talks about how Ellington's sound and innovation are all about using voice as a jazz instrument, like in \"Creole Love Call.\" This was one of the first times he used voice to add some extra texture and tone without getting in the way of the lyrics. It's a slow, 12-bar blues piece with six parts, and it's really interesting to see how he plays with different styles. Here's what happens in each part:\n\nPart 1: It's all about call and response between the voice and the woodwinds, with the voice starting smooth and getting rough towards the end.\nPart 2: There's a muted trumpet solo that takes the basic melody and makes it sound even cooler with some long, blue notes.\nPart 3: The clarinet takes center stage with a super high and wild solo, and the piano is in the background with a subtle, syncopated beat.\nPart 4: The whole band echoes the first part with call and response, but this time it's the brass and woodwinds.\nPart 5: This is the climax, where the woodwinds start calling out in a high register and the brass and rhythm sections are all over the place.\nPart 6: It goes back to the first part, but this time the voice is growling like an instrument and soloing like crazy.\n\nIt's just one example of how Ellington used voice to add some serious tone color to his music. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" he takes it to the next level by combining his skill at writing tight arrangements with his ear for tone color. He gets \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox on scat singing to create this super rich and complementary sound. In \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to make the melody on muted trombone sound super cool.",
            "There was this weird feeling inside of her that she just couldn't shake off. It started when she was 14 and had just begun to get into the whole teenage scene, and it was still going strong at 17. She was convinced it was something more than just a thing she needed, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what that 'something' was. Guys had tried to catch her attention, but none of them did. She often wondered why on earth she felt like this. She'd thought about it so much over the years that she'd come up with some pretty wild theories, but nothing that made total sense. So she just went with it, constantly questioning her own desires.\n\nAt home, things were usually chill. Her parents were pretty laid back and never fought with each other. They rarely even got into it with her, and when they did, it was just because she was being a bit too independent. She was the total opposite of her parents, super energetic and fun. People loved her for it. But today, things were different.\n\nAs she walked from room to room looking for some inspiration, she heard a loud scream from the kitchen and her heart started racing. She rushed in to find her mom on the ground, looking really hurt. Her mom was saying 'ow' over and over and her daughter freaked out. \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" She quickly ran to her mom's side and helped her up, trying to be brave. \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mom's words were all jumbled and rushed, and her daughter could tell she was in a lot of pain. \"Okay, Mom, where do I pick you up?\" Her mom pointed and she was grateful she'd taken self-defense classes so she could help her out. She carried her mom to the car, got her settled in, and sped off.\n\nThe hospital was a whole different story - it was all sick smells and worried faces. Her brain wasn't really taking it in though, she was too focused on her mom. She got her to the hospital and called out for help, then just sat there waiting for the doctors to figure out what was going on. Someone wheeled her mom off to get checked out, and she was left sitting there, worried sick.\n\nApparently, her mom had tried to grab a vase from a super high cabinet and fallen off a stepping stool. Whoa. That was a pretty crazy thing to happen.",
            "This study checked if sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" - aka the \"Med diet\" - really helps cut the risk of getting heart disease and strokes and even dying from them. We made a special version of the Med diet called \"alternate Mediterranean diet\" (aMed) that's a bit different from the original. It's all about eating a lot of plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and beans (but not potatoes), plus some fish, and less of the fatty stuff from animals. You can even have a little bit of booze if you want.\n\nMost research about the Med diet has shown that following it can be good for you, but this time we were looking at how it affects stroke and stroke deaths. Previous studies said that people who ate a Med diet were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart problems, and even lost weight better than those who ate a low-fat diet. But nobody checked if it also helps with strokes.\n\nWe looked at 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old who weren't sick with heart problems or diabetes. They're all part of a huge study of nurses in 11 US states. Every year from 1984 to 2004, we asked them about their eating habits through these questionnaires, and we used a special score to see how well they followed the aMed diet. Most of the nurses kept participating for the whole 20 years, and we checked the accuracy of their answers by looking at their medical records. When we didn't have those records, we made an educated guess, which was right about 17% of the time for strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nWe also looked at things like their weight, if they smoked, if they took aspirin or multivitamins, and how much exercise they got. To make sure our results were accurate, we averaged the women's aMed scores over 2 years instead of looking at one year at a time. We also took into account things that could mess with our results, like age, smoking, weight, and stuff like that.\n\nUsing a special math tool, we found out that eating more like the Mediterranean diet helped lower the risk of heart disease and strokes in these women. Out of all the women we checked, 2391 had a heart attack, 1763 had a stroke, and 1077 died from either of those things. Women who ate the most like the aMed diet were less likely to get heart disease or a stroke than those who didn't eat like that at all (their risk was 71% lower).",
            "Back in 2007, the United States was hit with this super harsh financial crisis. People were losing their jobs, the housing market tanked, and all these big, super-important companies were basically left for dead. And guess what? We're still dealing with the aftermath, so we're all like, \"Dude, how did this happen and how can we prevent it from happening again?\" So, in a nutshell, the financial crisis was basically caused by some pretty selfish and clueless political decisions that made banks and firms give out all these sketchy loans to people who weren't exactly in a good financial spot. Meanwhile, these huge companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were like, \"Hey, we gotta help out these people by buying and re-selling these mortgages,\" but they were all based on shaky ground. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were all, \"Oh no, we're low on cash,\" and then they passed the chaos onto the next guy, and the next guy, and the next guy in line.\n\nBut the roots of this financial mess go way back to 1999 when the Clinton administration was all, \"Hey, I want to get re-elected, so let's relax some of the lending rules and see what happens.\" And, well, it didn't exactly turn out as planned. Steven Holmes from the New York Times was all, \"Uh-oh, we're gonna have a problem if we keep doing this,\" and he even predicted the whole thing would end in a massive bailout. And, guess what? He was totally right. It was like a domino effect, where all these fancy new mortgage things like adjustable-rate mortgages and collateralized debt obligations just tied everything together, making the whole economy super vulnerable to even the smallest change.\n\nIt's like, a whole bunch of factors came together to make the economy freak out. People were taking on way too much debt and getting all caught up in the housing market, making them super susceptible to even tiny changes in prices. And then, BAM! The housing bubble bursts and all these banks that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities are all, \"Uh-oh, we're toast!\" The top five investment banks had over $4 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which is like, a huge chunk of the country's GDP. In the end, some banks were sold for peanuts, others were dismantled, and some were forced to become super-regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie were like, \"Whoops, we're in trouble,\" and the government had to step in to take control of them in 2008.",
            "You know, the big reveal – that part in your story where you spread your wings and take to the skies with your writing, leaving everyone in awe. Or, on the other hand, your readers zone out and hit the back button as they silently curse your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to frantically yell at her monitor when she finds herself stuck in a sea of unnecessary details, and it's never the fun kind.\n\nExposition – that pesky part of your story where you lay out the groundwork, but end up bogging down the whole thing.  Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin tend to stumble into lengthy descriptions that amount to nothing, or worse, are just too much.\n\nWe've all heard the advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" but the truth is, Dr. Merlin still manages to get sucked into info dumps that leave readers yawning.  Exposition is that annoying voice in the back of your head telling you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff – not to be confused with that other pesky voice urging you to share every single detail about each character's childhood.\n\nIn a nutshell, exposition is when you're told about what happened, and it's usually just plain old telling.  In film, it's that one character that launches into a lengthy, tedious monologue, while in fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.  You're reading a story and you're told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they got hitched in a fancy ceremony, and that her husband was brutally murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to drag on for two whole pages, with both of them only getting two lines of dialogue each.  No, you'd expect the author to take their time to develop the husband's character, to show through his words and actions how deeply he adored his wife.  You'd also expect the heroine to reveal her feelings through her reactions and actions, especially if the story later on tells you that this was the case.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and give you insight into the heroine's character, showing what she saw in him, how strong their bond was, and what clues about her thoughts and dreams she reflected from his perspective.  You'd feel her pain when he died and become more connected to her as a result.\n\nIn essence, you'd want substance to back up the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  As a writer, it's your job to provide that meat.\n\nSometimes it's tempting to rush through certain parts, like introducing a new character and dumping a bunch of unnecessary details about their past.  Perhaps you know he used to be in the Air Force, he's the night manager of a gas station now, he's been married twice, has no kids, loves fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.  Don't do it.  Provide your readers with something more.",
            "Today I caught up on the news from Columbus, Ohio. I watched two newscasts, the first one being NBC 4 this morning on August 13, 2011. Their lead story was about a disturbing incident where a man named Shad Hostettler stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. I noticed they only spent about two minutes on it, which seemed like the right amount of time to me since it was a developing story. The only details they shared were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was already under arrest. I also saw his mug shot and thought he looked pretty sinister.\n \nThe next story was about an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers who got shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was in critical condition, and the police were still searching for the shooter, but no arrests had been made yet. This story seemed really short, and I'm guessing it might have been because the victim was black and from a black neighborhood. I've noticed for years that minorities get glossed over when they're victims of a crime, and it's like the media doesn't care about them as much. I mean, if a white person was in the same situation, the media would be all over it.\n \nThe news also covered a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They talked about where they think the incident happened and said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. The police are offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter.\n \nNext up was a story about the weather forecast for Saturday, with rain and thunderstorms predicted for the afternoon. They said the temperature would stay in the mid to low eighties all weekend. I thought they kept it a bit too short, but they probably wanted to leave it as a teaser to keep viewers tuning in.\n \nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The robber was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, and they made a big deal about how dark he was. I thought it was weird they spent so much time emphasizing that.\n \nAnother story was about a guy named Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was convicted of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my attention was that they said he got sentenced to 300 months in prison instead of 25 years. I don't know if they thought that sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he's Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's this thing with brothers, you know? It's like, this super strong bond that's untouchable. Inside that bond, all these emotions are swirling around: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers somehow just get each other, in a way that no one else does, and when they look at each other, they're basically staring at themselves. It's when things get really tough that the true nature of that bond comes out, whether it's good or bad. When those feelings become super clear, they come with a big price to pay. Part of understanding this stuff is dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you can look a brother in the eye and see a part of yourself staring back, you see who you really are, not how others see you. Your true character is in the stuff you do and what happens because of it. \n\nIn \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this whole brother thing, with all the crazy emotions that come with it. The story's set in this really vivid world, and these two guys go on this doomed journey. Bitter sadness clashes with intense pride in the crazy final scene, and only one of them gets out alive. The theme is all over the place, but it's mainly about the main character, Doodle, and his bro's interactions, as well as the narrator's point of view, which shows all the complicated feelings Doodle's got going on. \n\nDoodle's main thing is pride. From the beginning, when they first go out together, to their last, super intense trip, Doodle's all resentful towards his little bro, Doodle. He wanted a bro who'd be all into the same stuff as him, like learning how to hold his breath or climb trees. He wanted someone to hang out with in Horsehead Landing or sit with in the top fork of that big pine tree behind the barn. But that's just not possible with Doodle, 'cause he's got a weak heart and can't do all the cool stuff. The young Doodle had these huge dreams, and they get totally crushed when he realizes it's never gonna happen. He even thinks about killing Doodle, which is just wild, but then Doodle smiles at him, and suddenly he's all warm inside. That shows you that his feelings aren't as strong as he thought. Even though he's got some anger towards Doodle, deep down he loves the little guy.",
            "The human brain is a super cool, super complex thinking machine that's been around for ages. Over time, people's ideas about how it works have evolved along with technology - it used to be thought to be like a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and nowadays it's like a super-duper computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons aren't perfect and can sometimes lead to some pretty weird conclusions.\nFirst off, the brain takes in information from your senses - like touch, heat, sounds, or light - and turns it into a bunch of electrical signals. As this info gets processed in the brain, it gets transformed again and again in both top-down and bottom-up ways. For instance, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together tiny pieces of information like color, direction, and borders to figure out that you're looking at a box. Then, the brain uses the decisions it made earlier to speed up your recognition of the box, kinda like a shortcut.\nAfter a while, the brain decides which signals are important and which ones should be ignored. For example, even though your brain is processing every single blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, your brain's \"selective attention\" filter helps you tune it out. On the other hand, if someone yells out your name in a noisy room, you'd probably pick up on that way faster. There are lots of stages to this process, and the brain's attention filter is like a button that gets pressed again and again to decide what's important.\nFor the brain to process information, it needs to be stored somewhere. There are different kinds of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain encodes the information - there are special ways to do this depending on what kind of info it is. For example, words can be encoded based on how they look, how they sound, or what they mean. Once the info is stored, the brain needs to keep it safe. Some studies on animals suggest that working memory, which lasts for about 20 seconds, is like a temporary electrical signal that zaps through a certain group of brain cells. Information in long-term memory, on the other hand, might be stored in the shape of certain special proteins.\nThere are tons of theories about how the brain organizes knowledge, ranging from how people remember things, to computer science ideas, to what happens in the brain itself. One popular idea is the semantic network model, which says that there are special nodes in the brain for concepts, and that they're connected to each other based on how they're related. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns of the dangers of a future where technology and capitalism are deeply intertwined in his novel Brave New World. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned to prioritize immediate happiness above all else. It's like they're trapped in a never-ending cycle, forced to conform to a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist ideology, Huxley's work reveals his concerns about the emerging systems of his time. Terms like homogeny and reification, commonly used in Marxism, suggest that the novel is a commentary on the negative effects of these systems. \n\nCapitalism is also heavily criticized in Brave New World, particularly through the concept of false consciousness. Essentially, the general population is kept in the dark about their true relationship with other classes, and they're only concerned with their own gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of people, especially the lower classes like Delta and Gamma, who are made to crave consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this desire, making it seem like it's their own idea. The lower classes are essentially brainwashed into accepting their place in society, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are either unaware of the manipulation or choose to ignore it. The way the social classes interact with each other is a clear indication of the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and lack depth. The characters are one-dimensional, and even the main characters are often portrayed as lacking any real emotions or connections. This could be seen as Huxley's way of saying that the rise of technology and capitalism is stripping people of their free will and individuality. Love and strong emotions are non-existent, and people are only concerned with superficial interactions, like commenting on physical appearance. The fact that each class is content with their place in the hierarchy and follows the rules without question is a reflection of Marxist ideas about the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and obey.",
            "So, I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now, which is four and a half semesters, I guess. For a lot of us, getting around campus can be super tough. My freshman year I lived in an East Halls dorm room; basically as far east as you can get without counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It took me up to 25 minutes to get to classes in the Willard building, which is pretty central, especially when it's all yucky outside, like it often is in State College. I talked to an alum not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were totally separate from the rest of the school, with huge chunks of empty land in between. Nowadays, that space is filled with sports fields, brand new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As our campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this mobility problem? On a college campus, it's gotta be the bike. But just having a bike isn't enough - students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be made bike-friendly.\n\nI was talking to my friend who recently started biking again after a long break, and he said, \"Bikes are awesome.\" He told me, \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's literally the best way to get around.\" Not only is it good for your body, but it's also super efficient. Eating a bowl of oatmeal and doing a little exercise can get you 30 miles or more. Like many of us, I'm living off campus now, and it's just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I've done this year was buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with my bike, I can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is, Pollock Road is the straightest route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always easy, no matter if you're biking or not. There are some good things to say about walking too, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up way too much of my time. Walking to Thomas every day would be an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. Add all the other time I'd have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's more time than I can spare."
