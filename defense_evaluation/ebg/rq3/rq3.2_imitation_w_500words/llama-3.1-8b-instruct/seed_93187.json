            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My dream is to pursue a career with the Division of Family and Children Services where I can help young ones who've been through a rough patch and troubled families in need. My values of service, respect, and a strong moral compass are what I believe will make me a valuable addition to the social work field. These aren't just buzzwords to me - they're genuinely important values that I strive for both personally and professionally. My goal is to help people, but I wasn't always sure how I could do this. In high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and some turning to less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. Seeing this, I decided to study Psychology, still unsure what I wanted to do with my degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, but a summer visit to a friend's house changed everything. There was this sixteen-year-old kid on her couch, visibly nervous, and she told me why he was visiting: his parents were abusing him. The next day, I learned he'd called the cops. I visited his parents' place, explained my concerns to the police, and told them about my Psychology degree. They asked me to talk to the parents since the law couldn't intervene, so I did. The parents seemed really uptight and made excuses for their son's behavior, saying he was manipulative for involving outsiders. That experience made me realize how much I wanted to help kids with family problems like that.\n\nAnother value that's super important to me in social work is social justice. We claim society values individuality, but it seems like we actually prioritize fitting in with the norm. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we try to be like everyone else? I'm all about being true to myself and not putting limits on who I am. In school, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could: I dyed my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that expressed my personality, got piercings that made me happy, joined the GSBA, and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I'll keep fighting for social justice because it's a part of who I am.",
            "This paper looks at how the biological and sociocultural models relate to the disorder insomnia. The biological model is all about the genetic code we inherit from our family and how medical stuff affects our health. The sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines how things around us like racism, ethnicity, demographics, and our financial situation can influence our sleep problems. This review explores these two models by explaining each research study that's relevant to them, trying to understand how they're connected. Then, I'll critique each study to point out what they do well and what they don't.\n\nInsomnia can be broken down into three main categories: it's either a sleep disorder itself, connected to another mental health issue, or caused by something else like a medical condition or a substance. Primary sleep disorders are either Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, which are basically the two groups of sleep disorders. Dyssonmias, which are linked to starting and staying asleep, include things like Primary Insomnia, where you can't sleep properly, and Primary Hypersomnia, where you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy involves weird episodes of automatic behavior during REM sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias are sleep disorders that involve weird behaviors or physical things happening during sleep, like Nightmares, Sleep Terrors, or Sleepwalking. I'm focusing on insomnia and some Primary sleep disorders in this review, especially in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model looks at how our genes, what we inherit, and our body's physical stuff affect our sleep. It's like, our brain has special cells called neurons in the hypothalamus that control our sleep and wakefulness. One study used mice and found that these neurons have special receptors that help us sleep and wake up. If these receptors get messed up, it can cause problems with sleep. The study showed that a special medicine that interacts with these receptors can actually help us sleep better. This study is cool because it shows that our genes and environment can affect our sleep. If we inherited something that affects our sleep receptors, it could mess with our ability to sleep properly, which is a big deal because it can impact our daily life, like school, work, and even doing boring tasks.",
            "So, let's dive into the three main areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First off, we're going to define what CAPD is all about. Then we'll get into the diagnosis part, including all the telltale signs or \"red flags\" that a teacher should look out for. Finally, we'll wrap things up by talking about how a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can help out a student with CAPD.\n\nSo, CAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is basically how well your brain handles what you hear. It's a disorder where the central nervous system (CNS), aka your brain, can't process the sounds it receives properly. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain isn't doing its job to separate words or tell the difference between background noise and actual conversation.\n\nThe first recorded mention of what would eventually become CAPD was back in the 1950s when researchers came across a condition called \"auditory imperception\" when trying to figure out why some kids were having trouble with communication. It wasn't until 1954 that an Italian research team started working on tests for these kids, and by 1961, a Japanese researcher named Kimura came up with a model that explained how the brain works when we hear two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of ways: someone with it might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from or hearing them in space, or they might struggle to tell two or more sounds apart. They might also have a hard time recognizing patterns in sounds, or telling when someone is being sarcastic based on how they say something. It can also be tough for people with CAPD to put together all the sound clues they hear and make sense of them, or to figure out the order in which sounds are happening. And, yeah, it can even be hard for them to tell when one sound is blocking out another.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, you need to do a bunch of tests that check how well someone's brain is processing sounds. These tests are usually done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists, and they might involve questionnaires, observing how someone reacts to different sounds, or even recording what's going on inside their ear and measuring how they respond to it. There's no one test that works really well for figuring out CAPD, and we still don't know what causes it. But these tests can give us an idea of what's going on.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that using a disguise to fool people for a long time can actually trap you if you don't shed that fake identity. The thing is, when you finally stop pretending, it can lead to some real problems. You might find yourself all alone because the people around you got hurt by your deception. It's a tough decision: do you save yourself, or the people who got caught up in your trick? Some people might be pretty chill about it, but others will be super mad. The more complicated thing is when the disguise is about switching genders. It's like, why do people feel the need to pretend to be someone else? In the case of Viola, she's just trying to protect herself by pretending to be a guy. She does it to avoid getting hurt, like \"I'll take you to a captain who helped me hide my feminine side so I could work for this noble count.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.247-249)\n\nSo Viola comes up with a plan and pretends to be a dude, which actually works, but it also makes her miss out on the support of the women around her. To make things worse, Olivia thinks she's actually talking to a guy named Sebastian, not a girl, and falls for it. Plus, Viola's also got some unrequited feelings for Orsino, but she's got to hide it because she's pretending to be a guy, like \"boy, you've told me a million times you don't like women like me.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.260-261)\n\nIt's a bit weird to look at it from today's perspective, but Twelfth Night might be saying that deception can actually help people figure out their real feelings. Maybe Olivia and Orsino have secret desires that Viola/Cesario makes them confront. For example, is Olivia really into Cesario because he's a guy, or is she secretly into girls? I think it's probably not the case, because Olivia's character is probably just making fun of people who judge others based on looks. We can tell because she quickly goes from liking Cesario to loving Sebastian, and starts treating Viola like a sister instead of a love interest, like \"you're her, a sister.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.315)",
            "People have been talking about how brutal the German colonial rule was, especially the way they dealt with the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. But it's not as simple as saying that's all the German colonies were like. They were all pretty different places with different policies and ruling styles. Even their educational systems varied, and it's not like they all followed the same rules. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that there were a bunch of educated and literate Africans living there. The German's efforts to educate people in Kamerun and other colonies even got some good reviews from writers back then.\n\nBut then you have South West Africa (now Namibia), which was a totally different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government built schools and tried to help the locals get an education, the task of teaching the natives in South West Africa was basically left to some missionary groups with not a lot of government support. The government did put a lot of resources towards teaching Europeans in the colony, though, and they set up schools and regulated the missionary schools even more. These choices had a big impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies had a bunch of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa the majority of the population remained pretty much untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. It's been argued that this was partly because of a bunch of different social, political, and economic factors.\n\nA lot of people have written about education in the German colonies, but most of their stuff is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of the earlier stuff just described the educational systems in the different colonies, while later writers did more in-depth studies and compared the systems between colonies. One of the most important studies is Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that the main reason for the differences between the two colonies is because of the number of settlers living in South West Africa. Compared to the other German colonies, South West Africa had a pretty nice climate, but a lot of it is desert. The number of European settlers in South West Africa was pretty high, too - by 1913, there were around 15,000 of them, while there were only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next biggest settler population.",
            "The way we understand and categorize Popular Music has changed a lot over the past 100 years, with the field growing so complex that it's hard to keep track of all the different genres. To make matters even more confusing, many of the major genres, like rock, country, and jazz, have spawned countless sub-genres, making it tough to pin them down. One of the most exciting and expressive genres to have emerged in the past 40 years is Heavy Metal rock, which has become incredibly diverse and adaptable. Heavy Metal music has a knack for expressing a wide range of emotions, mostly leaning towards the darker and more intense end of the spectrum. \n\nAs the genre began to take shape, people quickly realized its potential for flexibility and started experimenting with different styles, which led to the creation of sub-genres, and eventually, sub-sub-genres. Today, the heavy metal scene is so vast that it's difficult to define what exactly heavy metal is. It has managed to incorporate elements from other genres, but like everything, it has its roots somewhere. To truly understand the diverse metal music out there, you need to grasp the core of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is, in many ways, a movement that's deeply connected to the darker side of human experience. It's often described as a \"more is more\" philosophy, where music is amplified to be louder, more intense, and more theatrical. Metal musicians are known for their incredible technical skills, which is evident in their music. Moreover, the heavy metal scene has a long history of being influenced by psychedelic substances, which, in the 1970s, led to the creation of wild, otherworldly sounds. Many metal bands have tapped into the dark, visceral qualities that characterized the Romantic Era, adding to the genre's mystique. The lyrics of songs like the ones by the Beatles, in their song Helter Skelter, showcase the darker side of the music, which has become a staple of the movement.",
            "I'm totally immersed in the world of Henri Rousseau's art, but it's not just his paintings that I'm obsessed with - it's the story behind them too. Like, a few decades before the Surrealist artists started painting their trippy works, Rousseau was already churning out his own dreamlike masterpieces. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is all about a chick who's stoked about the wonders she sees in a far-off land, but it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as an artist. See, he always wanted to get recognized and loved by his fellow artists and art lovers, but that came with a major internal conflict - should he follow the rules and paint like everyone else, or be a rebel and do his own thing?\n\nTo fully get what's going on with The Dream, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life story. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a French town called Laval. His dad was a rich hardware dealer, and growing up, Rousseau didn't have any fancy art training. Instead, he worked a regular job for France as a toll collector until he was forty. Yeah, he had a pretty cool nickname - douanier, or customs inspector, even though that's not what he really did. Tragedy struck when his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their babies. He was left with just one kid, Julia, and a ton of sadness. Painting became his escape and new beginning. Unlike all the other artists of his time who were painting idealized country folk, Rousseau was a folk painter through and through, with hopes and dreams just like the average dude.\n\nRousseau's desperation to be accepted by the art world makes sense when you consider that he was basically a newbie, started late, and was competing with all these other talented artists who were already making a name for themselves. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was getting famous that Rousseau started getting recognition too. According to art expert Jan Gordon, they were like total opposites - Matisse was afraid of painting stuff that was cliché, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would finally take him seriously as a real artist.",
            "A lot of smart people have argued that there's a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, or truth and beauty. I think it's because there's a reason at the core of this. John Keats said in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn most things in life from school or experience, but it seems like we get into ethics and aesthetics without being taught that way. Both ethics and aesthetics are more like describing things than telling people what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are really just trying to figure out why something is beautiful or moral, rather than making rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nGet to the point, talking about art or morals can never fully capture what's good or beautiful. For example, a discussion about the Mona Lisa might talk about stuff like the background and foreground, but it won't explain why it's good art. When people talk about their favorite work of art or literature, they usually say something like \"There's just something about it\" before trying to explain it. I think both art and morals can never be fully put into words. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how much we describe a work of art, there's something left over that can't be explained. I think ethics has the same property. Wittgenstein said that ethics can't be expressed, it's transcendental.\n\nI think morality and art are connected because we experience them in the same way, at a deep level that can't be fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean says, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. Maybe moral standards don't apply to other art forms like music, but they seem to be just as relevant to literature as they are to real life. Living involves values, and literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's got its own unique vibe going on, blending cultures from the foothills of the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. It's like this cool mix of cultures that flows from Köln along the Rhine River, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a rich cultural history, it's no surprise that Germany's got its roots in various tribes and sources. \n\nGermania's basically the ancestral homeland of the Germans, but the origins of its name are super disputed among scholars. Some think it comes from the Germanic Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. The Roman historian Tacitus said that, and he even wrote a book about it back in 98 AD. Julius Caesar, on the other hand, used the word 'Germanus' in his commentary on the Gallic Wars to describe the Germanic tribes he fought against. He got the word from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the people he'd already conquered and those he hadn't. In one of his books, Julius Caesar writes about how the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly waging war with the Gauls. Others believe the name 'Germanus' comes from the spear they used in battle, called a ger, or maybe from the Old Irish word garim, which means 'to shout', implying that the Germans were super loud or rowdy.\n\nTacitus wrote in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' that the Germans were a pretty distinct bunch, not really mixed with other cultures. He thought it was crazy that anyone would leave their homes in Asia or Africa to move to Germany, with its wild landscapes, harsh weather, and grumpy vibe. The Romans would send their soldiers to trade and conquer Germania, but they mostly stuck to their own empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the border of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood staring, my mind was a complete blank slate, taking in everything in front of me without really processing it.  I was just kinda zoning out to the whole scene.  It was like my thoughts were racing by so fast I couldn't even catch up to them.  It was like I was just observing everything without really thinking about it.  I mean, my brain was totally engaged, but not really connected to anything. \n\nI had this art book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", that I'd bought based on some advice from an artist I was working with.  I've been wanting to learn how to draw forever - since I was six - and this book was the key.  It teaches you all the basics, from what a pencil is to how our brains interpret lines.  One trick it shows you is to draw a square frame around the thing you're looking at to make it easier to understand.  So, like, if you're staring at a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, you just imagine a simple plane and that's it.  I'd heard about that technique, but when I tried it, I just couldn't wrap my head around it.  The picture was too overwhelming, so I just stood there and stared in awe.  I was trying to tap into some level of artistic vision, like Picasso's blue phase or Monet's love of greenery.  I was feeling pretty pretentious, like I was on the verge of creating something amazing.  I'd call it \"Work in Brown\".\n\nI started to pick up my pencil, my hand moving towards the paper with a plan.  I was ready to unleash my creativity.  But then my hand just sort of jerked back, like I'd lost my train of thought.  I tried again, but my hand just slapped the toilet handle.  I was trying to work, but my hand was just kinda spasming out.  I was staring at some gross brown stuff in the toilet, and I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  I picked up the mop, hesitated for a second, and then just stood there, staring.  My tie was all bunched up around my neck, and I was starting to feel pretty annoyed.  I mean, who leaves this stuff in the bathroom?  I thought about just giving up and walking away, but then I picked up the toilet paper roll and started mummifying my hand with it.  It was like I was in a daze, just going through the motions.  Finally, I dipped my hand into the toilet bowl, like I was some kind of crazy person.  I guess I just wasn't feeling it that day.",
            "The scary truth is that teenagers are dying behind the wheel at an alarming rate. A bunch of things combine to make driving a deadly trap for new drivers. The National Institutes of Health say that one big part of the problem is that the teen brain just isn't ready to handle driving. They're also super inexperienced, which doesn't just cause more fatal accidents, but also makes them way more likely to get into rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt's no surprise that teens do way worse when they're driving with their friends. I mean, who doesn't know that they're always together in the car? A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center showed a pretty cool correlation: the older the passenger, the fewer the car accidents. Some states like California have tried to make it safer for teen drivers by introducing temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and stop them from driving with their friends.\n\nBut let's be real, these temporary licenses are just a temporary fix. The real issue is that younger drivers, as a group, just aren't ready for the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He's done research that shows people under 19-20 are super into taking risks just for the thrill of it. That makes sense, so it's probably a good idea to delay getting a driver's license until that need for a rush starts to fade. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing more and more fatal accidents, and the death toll is probably going to be huge in the next few years. By 2010, all the kids born during the Baby Boom will be old enough to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nMaking new laws about this would be pretty straightforward. Schools could still teach driver's ed, but no one under 18 could drive. A provisional permit could still be issued, but only after a certain number of practice hours with an adult. The number of hours could be the same as most states require (in California, it's 6 hours of driving with an adult and 50 hours of practice). Because the problem is everywhere, making national laws would be a good way to protect teens all over the country. It's not a new idea, but it's one that could make a big difference.",
            "I spent the day going through the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films. I was really into the trick films that they had, there were 15 of them from '95 to '01. They mostly use editing to make it seem like magic. I watched them all and took notes on how they work. Most of the trick films are pretty straightforward and predictable, but a few of the later ones had some really cool stuff that didn't follow the rules. The trick films from way back when are all pretty simple - they're shot from one angle, don't move the camera, and stick to long and medium shots. But a few of the early 20th century films were like rebels and didn't follow these rules. They started doing things like using multiple shots.\n\nOne weird thing that all the trick films have in common is that they're all shot in a little box on stage. The camera doesn't move, it just stays in one place the whole time. This is really obvious in most of the old films, and it's something that they got from the theatre and magic shows. The problem with using a stage is that the people in the film can only move side to side, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in that old film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\", the actors come in from the side and just move back and forth. Even when they go out of the frame, the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nAll the trick films I watched were shot from really far away - a long shot, basically - and sometimes a medium shot. They never used close-up shots at all. This is because of the way that theatre and magic shows work - the whole performance is set up on a stage and the audience sees the whole thing at once. In most old films, the actors just stood in the middle of the screen and didn't move towards the camera, so there were no close-ups.\n\nMost of the trick films from back then were really short, like a minute or less. This is because they were just one big shot in the viewer's eyes, but actually consisted of several different shots all stuck together to make the illusion work. For example, in that old film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\", if you look closely, you can see where the shot with the fake head starts, even though the whole film is just one shot to the viewer. The trick films are mostly just short little magic tricks, but they're still really cool to watch.",
            "So, you wanna know about John Taylor of Caroline?  He was a total believer in that whole Republican thing, even though he was more of a farmer than anything else (he even dabbled in politics for a bit).  He was super dedicated to his causes, especially when it came to personal freedom and government.  His love for the simple life was basically the basis for all of his opinions on, like, pretty much everything.  He thought that farming was the key to making the government work right, and that's why he was always going on about how it should be the best career out there.\n\nTaylor thought that the US had a chance to create this awesome system of government because they didn't have any old traditions to mess things up.  He believed in the natural rights of people, and that they're all connected - if one is taken away, the others lose value too.  He thought the government should stay out of it and not mess with those rights.  He had this weird idea that in the \"state of nature,\" the strong and mean people were the ones who got ahead, but that's not how it should be in a civilized society.\n\nTo create this perfect society, Taylor thought the government should be all about acknowledging the good and bad in people.  He was super strict about his ideas on right and wrong, and he said that because government is run by people, it's gotta be human too.  He said that good principles are about protecting private property, helping out farmers, and keeping capitalism in check, and that a government based on those principles would work just fine no matter who's in charge.  But, he thought self-interest was a major problem, and that it's only bad when it's used to hurt others.\n\nTaylor was all about keeping the government small and limited, just like the Constitution says.  He didn't want the feds to have any more power than they absolutely needed, 'cause he knew that would just make 'em expensive and, like, super controlling.  But at the same time, he thought that just following the Constitution literally without thinking about what the people who wrote it meant could be a bad idea.  He also thought the Declaration of Independence was way more important than the Constitution, 'cause it talks about the US being a bunch of separate states rather than just one big nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, we noticed that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. That was pretty disappointing, and it's hard to figure out why that happened. You'd think that with winter coming to a New England campus, people would be less likely to commute by bike or on foot, which could explain part of the drop. Also, December's a crazy time with everyone wrapping up schoolwork and grades, which might make people forget all about filling out that commuter log. On top of that, December's the start of the holiday season, and everyone's busy getting ready for a long break from campus. When classes start up again in late January, it makes sense that log submissions would be low that month too. But none of that really explains why submissions were so low in February. Maybe projects like this one just naturally lose steam after the initial excitement wears off. So, we came up with the Carpool Challenge Week in March to try and get people excited again, and it worked - we saw an increase in log submissions that month. One of the biggest challenges we faced was keeping the project going when people naturally lose interest, and dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that are a part of higher education. \n\nAnother problem we encountered with this project (and probably any similar one) is that people love the freedom and independence that comes with driving their cars. That's just part of our culture, so we needed to offer incentives to get people to switch to alternative modes of transportation. We gave out a bunch of gift cards to local places, but it would've been cool to see how bigger prizes like a bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car might've boosted participation. That could've helped us avoid that dip in engagement we saw. We kept the same prizes throughout the project, which might not have been the best idea. If we'd announced bigger and better prizes as the project went on - like adding a bike in December and a car in January - I bet people would've been way more into it.",
            "So, you're probably wondering what an ETF is. Well, it's like a hybrid between an index fund and a stock – it tracks an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets, but trades like a single stock on the exchange. It gives you the benefits of owning a bunch of different things (like an index fund) and the flexibility to sell short, buy on margin, and even buy just one share, just like with a stock. And the best part? The fees for ETFs are way lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides – you gotta pay a commission for each trade, just like with stocks. Plus, there are a ton of different ETFs to choose from, which is awesome, but also kinda overwhelming. When picking an ETF, it's smart to really think about whether the benefits, like diversification, are actually working for you, and to what extent.\n\nWe're gonna take a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for about 63.6% of its assets. It'd be a real pain to go over all the holdings, so we're just gonna focus on the top 10. Here are the top 10 holdings and their share of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo figure out how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we're gonna use their current percentages to calculate their contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, like if the portfolio was made up of just these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. We got the Beta and Return calculations below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's pretty clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a higher return (6.11% higher) and lower Beta (0.12 lower) than the ETF. But here's the thing – it's possible that these two portfolios aren't actually that different from each other.\n\nTo check if they are actually different, we're gonna calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF's standard deviation.",
            "I was reading about Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" and I'm convinced it's one of his best works. In the poem, Poe mentions the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a term that he apparently picked up from Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island off the northern coast of Britain that the ancient Greeks thought was the edge of the known world, but people think Poe got it from someone else too. Poe was really into German writers like Goethe, and it shows. \n\nThis connection is a big deal because it proves how well-read Poe was. Karl J. Arndt, a writer who studied Poe and Goethe, noticed that their poems were similar and even thought Poe was copying Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature has a whole section on Goethe, who was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. There's a poem within Faust called \"The King of Thule\" that's pretty dark and talks about a king who loses his wife and then drowns his sorrows in booze. The king's story is kind of like the main character in \"Dream-Land\", maybe even a dark mirror image of Poe's own struggles with drinking. Goethe's Faust was even turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in another poem.\n\nPoe mentioned Thule twice in his writings, first in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and then again in \"Dream-Land\" as the start and end of the poem. It's like \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a place called Thule that's dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends. It's like he's stepping into Goethe's world. Goethe was a big deal in Poe's time, and Poe even admired Alfred Tennyson, who was friends with Goethe. Poe probably knew about Goethe's work through all the reproductions of his work that were happening after it was first published.",
            "If a customer was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store under California law, could they get punitive damages if the store manager, Paul Martin, was acting with malice because he was told twice about the spill but didn't clean it up for half an hour because he was eating dinner?  I don't think a judge would just dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages without a fight. To get punitive damages, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, would need to show that the store manager acted on purpose with a bad intention to cause harm, or that he acted really badly and didn't care about the consequences. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known that not cleaning the spill would be a problem because there were already a bunch of people slipping and falling in the store before her accident, and he still didn't do anything about it. Palmer might have a point, but it's not super strong because there were only six slip-and-fall incidents that year and Martin still didn't do enough to keep the store safe.\n\nIt looks like Martin was pretty clueless because on October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told him about the applesauce spill, and Martin basically said he was too busy eating dinner to deal with customer complaints. Then, at 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also told him about the spill, and he said the same thing. It wasn't until 30 minutes later, at 5:30 pm, that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. Before Palmer's accident, there had already been five slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 at the store. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're wondering if we should file a motion to get rid of the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, if someone gets hurt because the other person didn't do what they were supposed to do (like keep the store safe), they can get punitive damages if the other person acted really badly and didn't care about the consequences. The law says that's malice if the person knew what they were doing was going to hurt someone, or if they were really reckless and didn't care about the consequences. It's like when someone knows that what they're doing is going to hurt someone, but they do it anyway. That's not cool.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took an Islam course at CBC, where discussions often revolved around whether Islam is a hostile religion.  In my opinion, this question is more relevant now than ever.  Observing the mass media's shift from a hostile view of Islam to over-the-top tolerance since 9/11 has been pretty mind-blowing.  Back in 2001, it was unthinkable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam, running for office.\n\nThe story of the Prophet's life really fascinates me.  I've learned that it's almost like a biography of a hero, but it contradicts what I thought I knew about Muhammad.  According to history, I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam by conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them, but the biography portrays him as a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  People were drawn to his teachings because of some kind of inner light or something, not because they were coerced.\n\nIt's also weird how the stories of Muhammad's life have some parallels to the story of Jesus – like the time he fed a bunch of people with a small amount of food and had some left over.  I get the feeling that the writers wanted to make Muhammad out to be this super humble guy who didn't need to prove anything, but just lived life with integrity and performed miracles because that's who he was.  It's like they're watering down the real miracle of Jesus and trying to ride his coattails.\n\nI've also noticed that the biography includes a lot of stories that seem to be about providing proof that people converted to Islam on their own free will.  But the problem is that these stories are often based on second-hand accounts and seem suspicious because of that.  It's like they're trying to build a case for the validity of the stories, but it actually makes them seem less believable.\n\nWhat really gets me is that they're trying to paint Muhammad as this super nice and wise guy who's above reproach.  But history says that's not true, and I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It's like the original message of Jesus got lost in the shuffle as Christianity evolved after he was gone.  If we look at the big picture, it seems like Christianity has been moving further and further away from its roots.  I think we're starting to see a shift, though.  There are more people who care about the real story of Jesus and the ideas he stood for.  While some folks might stick with tradition, I think they'll be outnumbered.  Christians are becoming more aware of their history, and this awareness is going to keep growing.  It's like a longing will start to build up, to figure out what's real and what's been added to the story over the years.  It might take a long time - decades or even centuries - but eventually, Christianity will swing back to its original form.  A movement will emerge, and it will start stripping away all the extra stuff that's built up over time.  It's like the clock will start ticking backwards.  When this happens, people in the US and Europe will start to focus on what Jesus really taught, and the church will be there to guide them.  But here's the thing - because we're going back to basics, we'll see a lot less variety in what people believe.  Instead of all the different branches of Christianity, we'll see a lot more things in common.  History is full of examples of this kind of reversal.  Think about how the Roman Empire used to persecute Christians, but later became Christian itself.  Or how our country went from having African-American slaves to having African-American leaders.  A similar reversal is coming for Christianity, and it will be a journey back to the source.  To make this happen, people need to start seeing Jesus' words as metaphors, not literal rules.  So, what happened to the original message of Jesus after he was gone?\n\nLooking back, it's pretty obvious that Jesus was a part of the Jewish tradition.  When the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people didn't all agree on the same thing.  They split into different groups - the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and just regular people.  Monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the importance of the Hebrew scriptures were all key parts of Judaism at that time.  It's interesting to think about how different the Jewish people were, and how that laid the groundwork for Christianity.",
            "I think The Jungle shows how people's true nature is deep down selfish and self-centered. All they care about is making their lives as good as possible and not really considering anyone else. The Jungle proves this in lots of ways. It's super obvious with the owners and managers of the huge factories. All they want to do is make their companies as huge and awesome as possible, no matter who gets hurt or what gets in their way. They just don't care about anything else. Upton Sinclair's writing paints a picture of the super bad stuff they're causing by making pollution, like all the smoke and gross stuff coming from the factories. He shows that the owners don't care about anyone or anything that gets hurt. They don't even care about the people working for them or the animals living near the factories. They're all about making money and don't care who they have to step on to get it.\n\nThe owners and managers were also super bad to their employees, making them work crazy hours and then just laying them off without warning or helping them find a new job. Back when The Jungle was set, there weren't any laws to protect workers, so the owners and managers could do whatever they wanted. The people working in Packingtown were basically expected to deal with the awful conditions all the time, both at work and at home. There were some unions trying to help, but they were more about making money off the workers than actually helping them. The workers were treated so badly and had no way out of the system that they were basically slaves, and Sinclair said that's just as bad as the old slave system.",
            "Many authors use different techniques to influence their readers' feelings about important topics, and some are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of using these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs words that don't normally go together to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he adds meaning to a symbol, then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald uses the latter technique with lots of colors, like gold, green, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for colors, specifically white and gray, then uses that meaning to give readers a certain feeling about an important thing.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white and gray is really interesting. He gives them a meaning of uniformity, with white being fancy and high class, and gray being old and faded. He sets up this meaning right at the beginning of the novel by using them a lot. People like Daisy and Jordan are always dressed in white - almost everyone is, actually. Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine looks like she's been powdered into a milky white complexion. The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, and the halls are a gaudy mess of bright colors. Fitzgerald takes it further by using these colors on everyday, unimportant things, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down the white canyons of lower New York, and when he makes his schedule, the names of people at Gatsby's parties are just gray names.\n\nHe even uses these colors to describe plain or regular people and places: Jordan and Daisy had a white girlhood together, there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes, the kid on the train is gray, and the dog seller is an old gray guy. After Fitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray, he uses them to show that certain subjects are unimportant or uniform. He starts this with Daisy, after a long time without using these colors, he describes her as wearing white in a little white roadster, and suddenly she seems less like a person and more like just something that Gatsby wants and longs for. He uses more of this technique with Daisy to give her the impression of being a more uniform addition, like when there's a gray haze around her fur collar, or when she's wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "I recently looked into San Diego County's agricultural scene, and it's totally thriving thanks to its awesome climate. The county is producing a ton of awesome stuff, like juicy tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and spicy peppers. It's super popular for organic community supported agriculture food, with a bunch of local organizations having long waiting lists for their products, especially organic eggs and milk. Many of these farms also offer tours and activities like hiking and birdwatching, which is a win-win for landowners who can benefit from government programs and still get to enjoy the outdoors. It's like getting paid to be a nature lover!\n\nThe cool thing about organic farming is that it lets you have a super diverse ecosystem with tons of wildlife and plants, since you don't use any harsh chemicals. However, it can be a bit more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming. You need to work harder to keep pests and weeds under control and fertilize the soil naturally, and sometimes you end up losing more crops than you would with traditional methods. Plus, a small organic farm can't compete with the efficiency of a big operation. But, there are some other practices that can help the environment and wildlife, like planting cover crops and strategic grazing rotation, which can be more expensive. That's why it might be helpful for landowners to get some financial assistance or expert advice on how to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land I chose for this scenario is a 160-acre plot in Potrero, an area in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. It's located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but it covers over a hundred species of plants and animals, some of which are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher, and others that might be listed soon, like the burrowing owls. This land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s.\n\nI picked this piece of land from a real estate website and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might be able to do to cut costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I found an organic farm in the same area that I used as a model for this scenario.",
            "When it comes to negotiation, culture plays a really big role. Culture isn't just one thing; it's also about what it's not and what it means. It's not a single, uniform thing, and it's definitely not the same for everyone. Think about saying things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - these are way too broad and don't make any sense. It's actually more helpful to understand what culture means in the context of a specific situation and how it'll affect the negotiation. When you're dealing with a different culture, you naturally compare it to your own, and that's when things get interesting.\n\nTrying to get to know a different culture or mindset can be like studying its history or realizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change it, you just have to accept it as it is and work within its boundaries, especially when you're negotiating and you're in a weaker position. If you're in a foreign territory, respecting their traditions and beliefs can help you get past any cultural obstacles and move the negotiation forward.\n\nNow, here's the thing: culture isn't just about countries or nationalities. Companies have their own culture too, and it can be totally different from one company to another. For instance, some companies are super strict about work hours, while others are super relaxed. You can see this in how they dress, how they communicate, and even who they hire. Some companies really encourage employees to be philanthropic, while others only let them do it through certain approved charities. Looking at how American companies differ from each other (and even within the same company, depending on the region or urban vs. suburban) shows just how diverse culture can be.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important, because they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or community harmony is a big deal, you won't publicly shame your company or boss to get ahead in negotiations. On the other hand, if a culture values getting the best deal possible, they won't settle for anything less. Knowing these generalities can help you prepare for negotiations, but it's also helpful to get to know your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "There's this crazy quote from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" It gets referenced by St. Anselm in his argument about God's existence, and our other dude, Thomas Aquinas, seems to agree with him. Since we're gonna be talking about their arguments, we'll just assume they're both on the same page about the existence of God, specifically the God from the Bible. If we're talking about some random God-type, it wouldn't be a fair comparison, so let's just roll with it. \n\nThat said, I think both of these guys make some good points, but neither really lays out a solid, all-around case for believing in God. To understand this, let's break down Anselm's argument first. Anselm's all about finding proof of God within yourself, kinda like how you can know something's true just by thinking about it. He says that because God exists in our minds, we can't even imagine a world without him. It's a pretty weird concept, but basically, he's saying that you don't need any outside evidence to believe in God – just your own thoughts. He's talking about faith, you know, when you believe in something even if there's no concrete proof. \n\nNow, Aquinas is all about using logic and facts to prove God's existence, no faith required. This would be super helpful for getting new people into Christianity, since you wouldn't have to convince them to believe in something they can't see. Aquinas breaks down five different ways to prove God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He's all about how using logic can show you that God has to exist. Think of it like trying to finish a puzzle – if you know all the other pieces, you can figure out what the missing one looks like even if you can't see it.",
            "Somewhere around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who'd later be known as Buddha was born. He'd eventually give up the world and get enlightened, and his teachings became the foundation for Buddhism—the orthodox branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. The religion is over two thousand five hundred years old, and it looks really different from what it was like when Buddha was alive. You can see this in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, where they celebrate the annual water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular people both participate, and it's got some spiritual significance, even though Buddha never taught about anything like that. These differences run all the way from surface-level traditions to the core ideas that make up the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community has changed its core principles from both the monk's perspective and the regular person's. This happened due to both external and internal forces, some good and some bad.\n\nIn this discussion, we'll use some terms a lot. When we say 'internal force,' we mean something that comes from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether someone's a monk or not. An 'external force' is any influence from outside the Buddhist world. A 'hostile force' is something that harms or tries to harm the Buddhist community, usually because of a negative view of Buddhism. A 'benign force' is any influence that doesn't want to hurt or help Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other anyway. These terms will come up a lot as we talk about this.\n\nFirst off, it's essential to understand the basics of the religion—the core ideas that make up Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists look to the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha for guidance. The Dhamma is basically made up of the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for monks and regular people, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper, more philosophical ideas of Buddhism. Concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the idea that life is suffering), and Anicca (how everything's temporary) are all part of this. Recognizing these ideas can help you escape Sansara—the cycle of death and rebirth, which keeps going on and on. Along with Sansara, when you become enlightened, you'll also break free from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules laid out for how to live your life. For regular people, there are five basic rules (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't misbehave, and don't take drugs). For monks, there are many more rules to follow. The core idea of Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico had this crazy long-standing feud that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  It was like, the ultimate rivalry, and it really came to a head during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The US basically attacked Mexico, took over Texas and the Southwest, and it was a pretty intense clash.  Before the First World War, they were still having all these issues, but it finally started to die down.  This whole thing started because Americans and Mexicans had totally different ideas about stuff like religion, culture, and traditions, and they also had major disagreements over material things (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \nIt's not just the US and Mexico - lots of countries that share borders tend to have these kinds of rivalries.  The US and Mexico are actually kind of like many other countries that have been stuck in these long-term rivalries with their neighbors.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said something pretty interesting, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can you find long-lasting American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  These countries are basically right next to the US, and they've been at odds with the US for a while now.  Other countries in Latin America, on the other hand, have gotten along pretty well with the US.\n\nOne of the big issues was that the US and Mexico had totally different ideas about religion - and this has been a major problem in lots of countries throughout history.  Sally Frahm (2001) pointed out that Americans used to be super opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries (p.86).  It's kind of like how the Cold War was this huge ideological struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, except in this case, it wasn't about politics, but about whether they were Protestant or Catholic.  This whole thing started because the English and Spanish had a bunch of distrust, and the US and Mexico just inherited that.  This made it really hard for them to get along.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted up 17 different disputes between the US and Mexico during this 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes were about territory and border problems, like bandits and outlaws crossing the border.  The US and Mexico finally started to calm down when Mexico became super dependent on the US, and then they both started to focus more on economic stuff rather than expanding territory (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took a drastic turn due to a health condition that I never expected to affect me. I was a nurse at the time, and I had chosen that career path to guarantee a sense of security that I never had as a child. The constant advice I received as a kid, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" made me think that nursing was a safe bet. So, I put aside my dreams of being a scientist or journalist – a mix of both would've been awesome – and became a nurse.\n\nNow, here I am, 46 years old, single, and living on Social Security Disability after fifteen years. I've got nothing left to call my own, and every day is a struggle to stay afloat. My life feels like an ongoing battle for security, safety, and self-respect. Yet, amidst this chaos, I've learned one thing for sure: without the help of my family and a few genuine friends, I wouldn't have made it through these years. And trust me, when disaster strikes, you won't feel as strong as you thought you'd be.\n\nMy point is, emergencies will come in all shapes and sizes – and there's no way to prepare for everything. No matter how much you prepare, some situations are just too big to handle on your own.\n\nI agree that we should stop putting all our eggs in the US government's basket, as it's crumbling anyway. However, I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other, rather than building individual fallout shelters. The idea of rugged individualism that the Conservatives talk about is a myth; it was actually our ancestors' compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that kept them going through tough times. Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies didn't make it to the coast alone – they relied on their community.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare. I'm prepared – I've got a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and all the essentials. But it's not just about being prepared; it's also about building connections with your neighbors. Get to know the people around you, and work together to make your community stronger. If you've got the land and resources for a small farm, canning or preserving your own food is a fantastic idea, as is a wood stove – just make sure you don't live in an apartment.",
            "So, why do living things evolve the way they do? Is there some hidden force guiding the direction of change? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said zoologists were just starting to imagine describing organic forms in math terms, but we're not much further along today. Recently, math has been applied to the way shell-building creatures, like snails, grow and change over time (like their great-great-grandparents). Our study is exploring how math can help us figure out what makes the shapes of snail shells change. We took X-rays of snail species to measure the patterns that make up their shells, then plugged those numbers into this super cool computer program called CerioShell. We used those results to imagine what snail shells might look like if they'd evolved differently. We're combining that with some hands-on experiments to understand how shell shapes change over millions of years.\n\nImagine a snail shell as a spiral tube that grows and grows over time - it's like a big, twisty road that winds its way through space. Each twist is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a central axis (like a big, invisible pole) that runs through the shell's middle. The speed at which the whorls get bigger can vary, and there's a clear line between each twist, called a suture. In most shells, the biggest twist is the last one (the body whorl), and the rest are called the spire. The top point of the spire is the apex, and the bottom is the base. The snail sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different angles - from the top, from the bottom, from the front, or from the back. Usually, people look at shells with the aperture facing them and the apex pointing up.\n\nHere's a way to count the twists: first, look at the shell from the top, then find where the first twist starts. Draw a line that splits the shell in two, and then count the twists from there - you can even estimate a quarter of a twist if you're not sure. A shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through time and space as the snail builds its shell. By tracking the path of the hole, you can use math to understand how the shell grows. This lets you play around with different shell-building rules and see how they would affect the snail's shell shape.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has been pretty much the same for the past ten years.  It's weird because the country is doing okay on other things like getting clean water and sanitation, but it's really struggling to meet its targets for child and maternal health by 2015.  I'm gonna get into the reasons for this below, and they show that the country needs to improve its whole health system instead of just focusing on individual programs.\n\nIt's cool that Indonesia has gotten better at having skilled health workers at births, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  But what's strange is that this number includes traditional workers like midwives who can't do much if things get complicated.  So, the improvements in this area aren't as great as they seem, and there's still lots to be done.  The number of kids under five who get treated for diarrhea by a health pro has actually gone down, and the data on postnatal care is sketchy, but it's clear that this is a problem too.  We're talking low rates all over the country.\n\nC-section rates are way too low at about 4%, and that's not the only thing that's concerning.  The rates are way higher in cities (like 7%) than in rural areas (only 2%).  This shows that healthcare services are basically only available in cities.  Another problem is that some people can't access healthcare services because they can't afford it.  There's a huge gap in service use between the poorest and richest people in the country.\n\nNow we're talking about what to do next to improve neonatal and maternal care.  The big question is how to actually get more people access to healthcare services.  Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or strengthen its whole healthcare system instead of just focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for moms and babies?  I think program-specific approaches are tempting because they have clear goals and can produce quick results.  But there are some downsides.  One problem is that when we focus too much on one area, other areas don't get enough funding or resources.  Another problem is that all these separate programs can create a lot of extra work and duplication of services.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulously detailed descriptions and focus on the lives of the upper class during that era.  Two notable exceptions, however, are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels stray from the typical tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which helps to bring the characters to life and reveal their inner thoughts and emotions in a more profound way. \n\nOne of the most memorable scenes from an Oliver Twist passage reads: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n\nThese novels often use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, but the specifics vary in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often provide insight into Oliver's inner turmoil, what torments him, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. When Oliver relives the shooting in chapter 28, it's like he's reliving it in a dream, as he desperately searches for help. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his dire situation, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he's re-experiencing his despair without the initial shock of pain, now linked with ongoing fear. This scene raises questions about whose fault Oliver's misfortune is, as it's clear it wasn't his own. This reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable to even attempt to change the outcome, even when his life is at risk. This scene also implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin has broken him, making him accept his despair and lose his ability to react. \n\nIn another passage from Wuthering Heights, we find: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "It's been a couple years since I worked with a bunch of Elementary aged students in an after school program, teaching them whatever subject they were struggling with. My strengths were in English and reading, but I did my best to help them out in other areas too. I was asked to work one-on-one with this kid named Adrian - I think he was in either third or fourth grade - who was really struggling to read. It was weird, though; I realized that this kid was having some pretty strange problems. Some letters he could read perfectly, while others were completely off. I figured it had to be something other than what I thought at first, since he spoke perfect English, but I'm pretty sure he's Latino. I worked with him for a while, trying to figure out what was going on, but it wasn't until I met his mom that things became clear. She walked in on us while we were hanging out (I was basically babysitting him while the rest of the group was on a field trip), and it turned out she only spoke Spanish. Using my limited Spanish skills, we were able to communicate a little bit, and it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read, but he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. I don't know if that little epiphany helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to point out how language barriers can be a big problem in schools, especially here in California. I also want to show that it's not always as obvious as we think it is, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can be a huge obstacle for them. Everyone can agree on that, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There isn't just one answer. We've got dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of those things are going to fix this problem on their own.  The key is to combine them all.\n\nFirst off, I think the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all of them. Apparently, kids in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of people are scared of this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit from it. But that's not true. If we made these programs the norm, rather than the exception, all kids would be helped by it. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That wouldn't be realistic or fair. But I think it's a good idea to have bilingual tutors, aids, or whatever you want to call them. That way, we can make these programs work.",
            "We've all been told from a young age that there's something out there that's beyond our understanding. Some of us go to church, while others go to temple or try to figure things out on our own. Many of us just stick with what our parents taught us, but others reject it all and think there's just nothing more to life than what we can see and touch. We might adopt one set of values, then change our minds and switch to another. Whatever we choose, we're trying to figure out who we are through our own way of looking at the world. We're searching for a light in the dark to guide us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain pound against the tin roof while we both smoked. He said his favorite kind of bird was the cardinal, and just kept staring off into the rain. He looked really thin, and his clothes hung loose on him. I knew he was struggling. I felt scared and alone, and I didn't want to talk about how much I was going to miss him because it would make it too real for both of us. So I just hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just a few days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had kept him alive when the doctors thought it was time to let go, but it was just prolonging the pain. I didn't know what kind of God would do that. I didn't pray that night, and if there was a God, I thought he had stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him die, so I didn't. I wanted to remember my dad for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him go. So I just curled up in a ball and waited for the news. But nobody even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" seems like an oxymoron, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel - a mix of \"old\" and \"new.\" This genre has been both praised and criticized for its superficiality and its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create the prototype for the Gothic genre. By blending old theatrical clichés with new, naturalistic writing styles, Walpole created what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic literature often incorporates nods to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's release, the term \"gothic\" was already associated with various peoples, styles, and time periods, implying it was outdated and unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The combination of the theatrical, old-fashioned \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which provided readers with a more personal glimpse into character psychology, helped the Gothic genre endure and remain relevant, becoming both outdated and new to readers who came across it long after its initial writing.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which involves training a proper knight, is reinterpreted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry was essential to Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and contrasted it with the perceived lack of these ideals in their own society. By romanticizing and idealizing the chivalric past, Gothic writers attempted to improve the present. Given the tumultuous political climate when Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, and the unfair accusations he faced, it's possible that he believed the morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This idea is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as his royal status, his history of suffering, and his supposed bravery in the face of tragedy. The description of Frederic is riddled with traditional chivalric images, making him an exaggerated representation of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" trope, which would later become a hallmark of Gothic literature (Walpole 66).",
            "The flow of goods from the point when a customer places an order all the way back to the raw materials stage is referred to as supply chain management. Keith Oliver, a consultant, coined the term in 1982. He described the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain in order to meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently. The six key components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these six components to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production. It serves as the foundation for the entire chain. The production stage outlines the when, why, where, and how of production. To do this, managers need to figure out what customers want. One way to do that is by analyzing the market, which is the biggest indicator of customer demand. Once managers have a handle on customer demand, they can decide what products to produce and how many to make. They also need to decide where the products will be produced and which plant will be the best fit for volume and quality, all while keeping the customer's needs in mind. After that, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Every detail is crucial in the production process. If not planned carefully, it can end up costing the company a lot of time and money in the long run.\n\nFor instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a blueprint for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. Having a clear plan helps the company run smoothly and prevents confusion.\n\nThe second essential element in supply chain management is supply. It involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager needs to decide which division is best suited for the different processes of the product. They might also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity, which is the ability to provide high-quality products with flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "There's this wild sign on the street that says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". It's like something right out of a crazy dream. Ellen Page from Juno is standing on a corner, holding a cardboard sign with this unsettling message written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is this Southeast Asian country that's been ruled by a super oppressive government since 1962. They overthrew the government in a military coup, and things escalated quickly from there. In 2007, monks led some massive protests called the \"Saffron Revolution\" because of their bright orange robes. It was huge, with people from all over starting to take notice. At first, the government let them march, but then things got super violent - the military even broke into monasteries and attacked people. Journalists got arrested just for showing up, and a Japanese photographer named Kenji Nagai got killed for being in the middle of it all. The official death count is like, 13, but a high-ranking officer who defected from the army said there were thousands more. \n\nThis isn't new, man. Governments wanting to keep control over people has been going on forever. Ancient Roman emperors thought they were gods, Japanese emperors are basically considered divine, and our current prez, George W. Bush, has some weird connections to this Ted Haggard guy who's like the leader of some crazy group. There are so many examples of this - like that time in 1989 when people protested in Tiananmen Square and the Chinese government claimed only a few hundred died, but other sources say it was way more like 2,000-3,000. Then there was the Rwandan genocide where Hutu militias killed all these people, and of course, there was the whole \"Third Reich\" thing where Hitler and his crew went around killing Jews and others. It's all just super messed up.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his impressive lifespan, which allowed him to continually shape his orchestra and create new music. Although he's often not prominent on the piano in his compositions, Ellington's skill as a composer shines through in the rich and complex pieces he created that showed off each band member's abilities. He crafted the perfect setting for soloists to improvise, as well as tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted each musician's unique style. By doing this, he created a consistent tone for the orchestra and came up with unique sounds for each piece. Ellington's understanding of how each player sounded individually and how they fit together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary mentions Creole Love Call as an example of Ellington using the human voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This showcases his early use of voice to add texture and color without words getting in the way. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a talent he continued to show throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece is full of interesting textures. Here's what it's got:\nChorus 1: A call-and-response between voice and reeds, where the voice starts smooth and melodic, then gets rougher at the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds on the basic melody and emphasizes some extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, with a subtle syncopated piano phrase backing it up.\nChorus 4: The full band repeats the first chorus with a call-and-response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds start the call-and-response in a high register, backed by stop-time syncopation from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument.\nTag: A short tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color is just one of his many stylistic traits that are all over his work. In Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) takes this idea even further, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There's this nagging feeling that she's had for a long time. It started when she was 14 and entered the teenage scene. It's been around for three years now, and she's convinced it's something more than just a thing - it's a person. But, weirdly, none of the guys she's met have caught her attention. Some have tried to impress her, but it's like they were speaking a different language. She's constantly questioning this strange desire, trying to figure out what's behind it. Her thoughts have come up with some theories, but nothing that really makes sense. So, she's just going with the flow, wondering what's going on with her.\n\nAt home, things are usually chill. Her parents are super laid-back and rarely argue with each other. They almost never argue with her either, except when she gets all independent and free-spirited. That's just her way of being, and they respect it. But today wasn't a chill day. As she wandered from room to room looking for some inspiration, she heard her mom let out a loud shriek from the kitchen. She rushed in, freaking out, and asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mom lying on the ground, gritting her teeth and saying \"Ow\" between short breaths. Her daughter sprang into action, trying to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mom was in a lot of pain, so she quickly asked, \"Okay, Mom, where can I pick you up?\" Her mom gave her directions, and she was grateful she'd taken those self-defense classes - she was able to lift her mom and get her into the car.\n\nThe hospital had that weird mix of antiseptic and sickness smells, but she was too worried about her mom to notice. She rushed in and started calling for help, and soon a bunch of worried faces were around her mom, looking her over. They quickly wheeled her mom in, and she was left sitting there, worried sick. It turned out her mom had slipped off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to establish a link between following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. To achieve this, a modified version of the Med diet, named \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet, was used in the study. The aMed diet is characterized by a diet high in plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but low in animal products and saturated fats. A moderate amount of alcohol was allowed. \n\nPast studies already showed that sticking to a Med diet is linked to lower risk of total and heart-related (CVD) mortality, and a trial proved that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in helping people lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, previous research did not focus on the relationship between the Med diet and stroke.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term research project involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six occasions between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on the participants' self-reported diets, which they had detailed in food frequency questionnaires. More than 95% of the nurses remained involved in the study for the entire 20-year period. The accuracy of the reported diets was verified through separate studies. When medical records or death certificates weren't available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included in the research, which made up about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks.\n\nEssential data like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were also documented for each food frequency questionnaire. Starting in 1986, the participants' leisure-time physical activity was also recorded. To reduce individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated the average aMed score over two years by combining scores from the previous two questionnaires. The study controlled for factors that could influence the results by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical model, the researchers analyzed the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke. The results showed that women who followed the Med diet closely, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, were at a lower risk of developing heart disease and stroke. Over the course of 20 years, the researchers found 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of developing both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "Back in 2007, the United States was hit with a huge financial disaster. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market went down the drain, and many of America's biggest companies were left in shambles. This recession has stuck around, so we have to ask: what caused this mess, and how can we fix it? To get to the bottom of it, let's just say it all started with some super selfish and clueless politicians who made some pretty reckless decisions that tricked banks and companies into giving out bad loans. These loans went to people who couldn't afford them, and the financial system wasn't ready to handle it. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to back these mortgages and package them up into some complicated securities. When people started defaulting on these loans, the banks were in a tight spot and passed the buck to the people who had bought the repackaged mortgages. It was like a big domino effect, and the whole economy got knocked down.\n\nThe roots of this mess go way back to the Clinton days, when President Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he relaxed the rules on lending, which set the stage for the sub-prime crisis years later. Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote in 1999 that Fannie Mae was getting in big trouble because it was being forced to give out loans to people who couldn't afford them. Holmes even predicted that this would lead to a huge problem: \"The government-backed company might tank in a recession, leading to a huge bailout like the one in the 1980s.\" And guess what? He was right! As we all know, bad lending can lead to a total economic meltdown.\n\nA bunch of factors combined to make things worse, like these crazy new mortgage deals. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were all the rage back then, and they just made things more complicated. This led to people and companies getting way too invested in the housing market, making them super vulnerable to even small changes in prices. And then, BAM! The housing bubble burst, and all the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities got burned. The top five US investment banks were stuck with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which was like 30% of the country's entire GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers went down, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks with super strict rules. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in debt and got taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Okay, let's talk about exposition.  You know, that part in a story where you take a deep breath and try to wow your readers with your writing, but sometimes they just end up falling asleep or hitting the \"Back\" button in frustration.  Dr. Merlin has been there too, yelling at her monitor when she gets stuck in Too Much Information land.\n\nExposition is basically a writing nemesis that tempts you to tell instead of show.  You already know the basic rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's still easy to get sucked into boring passages that don't move the story forward.  Exposition is like that pesky voice in your head that says, \"Just get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the exciting parts.\"\n\nSo, what is exposition exactly?  It's when you tell your readers what happened, usually in a straightforward way.  In movies, it's like when one character spouts off a bunch of info to another - like a \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" marathon.  As a writer, you're the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's look at an example.  Imagine you're reading a story and suddenly you're hit with a few paragraphs of info about the heroine's love life: she met her husband, they got married in a big ceremony, and he got murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect that whole sequence to take up two pages, with both characters only getting two lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to flesh out the husband's character through his words and actions, so you can see how much he loves his wife.  You'd also want to get a glimpse of how her life changed with him and how she felt about him.  That way, when the author tells you they had an amazing connection, you'll believe it and care about what happens to them.\n\nIn short, you want to add some meat to the bare bones of the story.  Instead of just saying \"They met, they married, he died,\" you want to make it feel real.  It's tempting to rush through the details, but trust us, it's worth taking the time to make it count.  For example, let's say you're introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station, was married twice, and has all these other traits.  Don't give your readers a laundry list - show them through his actions and dialogue instead.  It's easier to get caught up in the story that way.",
            "Today I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio - an NBC 4 live report this morning (August 13, 2011) and a few other stories. The first one I saw was about a dude named Shad Hostettler who knifed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They showed his mugshot and, let's just say, he looked like the baddest of the bad. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still developing. I think they got it right, though. \n\tThe next story was about some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers getting shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was in critical condition, and the SWAT Team was on the case, but no arrests had been made yet. This story felt kinda short, and I'm wondering if it's because the victim was black. I've noticed that when minorities get hurt or get murdered, it's like they fade into the background. If a white kid or adult gets kidnapped or gets hurt, the news goes crazy, but when it's a minority person, they're lucky if they even get a mention. \n\tThey also did a piece on the gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter. They said the bullet was probably from a .22 caliber rifle, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that'll lead to the shooter. \n\tAfter that, they did a tease for some thunderstorms and rain on Saturday afternoon, saying the temps would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. They kept it short so we'd stay tuned. \n\tThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said the robber was a dark-skinned black guy wearing a hoodie and a sweatshirt. They went on and on about how dark he was, which seemed kinda weird. \n\tAnother story was about some dude named Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who'd been caught selling a lot of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my eye was when they said he got sentenced to 300 months in prison instead of 25 years. I'm not sure what the point was there - maybe they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but that didn't seem super relevant to the story.",
            "There's a special connection between brothers that's unbreakable and unshakeable - a bond that's filled with a mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and sometimes even cruelty. Brothers have a way of understanding each other that's deeper than any other kind of connection, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. It's when things get really tough that the true nature of this bond really comes out - whether it's good or bad. When these emotions are clear, they come with a big price tag. Part of understanding the emotions that come with being a brother is dealing with the consequences that come with them. When you can look a brother in the eye and see your own reflection staring back at you, you see yourself for who you really are, not how others see you. It's in your actions and the consequences of those actions that you really find out what you're made of. In the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this theme and all the crazy emotions that come with it. They set out on this wild journey through a vivid and beautiful landscape, but it's all for nothing in the end. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the most intense moment, and only one brother makes it out alive. The theme is shown through how the characters act and talk to each other, and also through the narrator's point of view, which helps us see how the protagonist feels and sees the world around him. \n\nThe whole story is all about one main emotion: the protagonist's pride. From the very beginning, he's super resentful of his little brother, Doodle, who was born with a weak heart and can't do all the cool things the protagonist wants to teach him. He wanted a brother who could be his partner in adventure, but Doodle's condition makes that impossible. The protagonist even thought about killing Doodle at one point, which is just crazy, but when Doodle smiles at him, it makes him realize he actually loves his little brother deep down. It's like his heart was beating with love all along, even if he didn't want to admit it. The story shows how the protagonist's love and anger towards Doodle are always at war, and in the end, it's a battle he can't win.",
            "My brain is like, super complicated and creative, you know? It's like it's got its own way of processing information. Over time, how we've described it has changed with the advancements in tech. Initially, it was like a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and now it's compared to a computer. However, keep in mind that these comparisons aren't that accurate and might lead to some pretty big misunderstandings. \n\nWhen I'm learning about my brain, I'm picking up that it gets info from my senses first. It takes the physical things like touch, heat, sound waves, or light and turns them into these electrochemical signals. The brain breaks down this info in two ways – bottom-up and top-down processing. When I look at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together simple stuff like color, orientation, and where the box starts and ends. Then top-down processing kicks in and uses that info to help me figure out what the box is, like a box and not a hole in the background. \n\nAfter that, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which brain processes I should let it in. For instance, when I look down at my shoes, my brain processes every blade of grass, but the attention filter keeps me from actually seeing them. But if I'm trying to hear my name in a crowded room, that filter lets the sound through. There are lots of stages of processing, and my brain goes back and forth with the attention filter a bunch of times.\n\nIn order for my brain to process info, it's gotta store it first. There are different types of memory – sensory, working, and long-term. First, it's gotta be encoded, and there are different ways to do that depending on the type of sensory info. For example, if someone's talking, my brain can encode it based on what it looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means. Once it's stored, my brain's gotta keep it. Animal studies have shown that working memory, which is like, temporary, is kept by an electrical signal looping through some neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are lots of different models explaining how the brain organizes knowledge, and they're all based on different things – like how people remember stuff or how computers work or how the brain is wired. One of these models is the semantic network, which says that there are these nodes representing concepts, and they're connected based on how related they are. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World paints a picture of a dystopian future where technology and a capitalistic society reinforce each other. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a larger game, trapped in a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. By examining the novel through a Marxist lens, it becomes clear that Huxley has some major issues with these emerging systems. Terms like homogeny and reification are scattered throughout the book, hinting at his concerns about the economy of his time. \n\nHuxley uses satire to poke fun at capitalism by highlighting the concept of false consciousness. This basically means that regular folks don't really know their place in the economic hierarchy; they're too busy looking out for themselves. This is essentially the result of ideological control over the working class, something that's super obvious in Brave New World. The lower classes are basically mindless drones, conditioned through hypnopædia to desire, consume, and indulge above all else. The World Controller is behind it all, manipulating the masses like pawns on a chessboard. The idea of hegemony – where one group dominates another – is totally at play here. The lower classes are oblivious to the manipulation, blindly following the ideology that keeps them in line. The upper classes, on the other hand, are aware of it, but they just accept their place in society. Only a few characters, like Bernard, seem to care about the bigger picture. The way the social classes interact with each other is a huge indication of the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are basically non-existent. The novel seems to strip away any depth or emotion from its characters, even the main ones. Huxley might be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together is stripping people of their free will and individuality. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions that are purely physical or superficial. The way characters talk about each other, focusing on appearance rather than substance, is a big clue. The fact that each social class is content with their place in the hierarchy is a clear indication of how capitalism affects people's perceptions of themselves and their place in society.",
            "So, I've been at University Park for two and a half years. It's basically four and a half semesters for those who are counting. Getting around campus can be a real pain in the butt. Last year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is basically the last stop on campus, except for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. I'd have to trudge from my place in Stuart Hall all the way to the Willard building near the middle of campus, which would take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially if the weather's lousy. I talked to an old alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were cut off from the rest of school by a huge empty space. Nowadays, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus keeps expanding, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? For a college campus, it's gotta be bikes. But it's not just about having a bike; people need to ride them, and the campus needs to be bike-friendly.\n\nI was chatting with a friend who recently got back into biking after taking a few years off, and he was saying how he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for you, but it's also super efficient. You can pack a bowl of oatmeal and get 30 miles or more out of it – not bad for a little exercise. I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I did this year was buy a bike. Now, every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with a bike, I can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. I've got to give credit to walking, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up a ton of my time – over two and a half hours every week. That's time I just can't afford to waste."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",

Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My dream is to pursue a career with the Division of Family and Children Services where I can help young ones who've been through a rough patch and troubled families in need. My values of service, respect, and a strong moral compass are what I believe will make me a valuable addition to the social work field. These aren't just buzzwords to me - they're genuinely important values that I strive for both personally and professionally. My goal is to help people, but I wasn't always sure how I could do this. In high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and some turning to less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. Seeing this, I decided to study Psychology, still unsure what I wanted to do with my degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, but a summer visit to a friend's house changed everything. There was this sixteen-year-old kid on her couch, visibly nervous, and she told me why he was visiting: his parents were abusing him. The next day, I learned he'd called the cops. I visited his parents' place, explained my concerns to the police, and told them about my Psychology degree. They asked me to talk to the parents since the law couldn't intervene, so I did. The parents seemed really uptight and made excuses for their son's behavior, saying he was manipulative for involving outsiders. That experience made me realize how much I wanted to help kids with family problems like that.\n\nAnother value that's super important to me in social work is social justice. We claim society values individuality, but it seems like we actually prioritize fitting in with the norm. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we try to be like everyone else? I'm all about being true to myself and not putting limits on who I am. In school, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could: I dyed my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that expressed my personality, got piercings that made me happy, joined the GSBA, and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I'll keep fighting for social justice because it's a part of who I am.",
            "This paper looks at how the biological and sociocultural models relate to the disorder insomnia. The biological model is all about the genetic code we inherit from our family and how medical stuff affects our health. The sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines how things around us like racism, ethnicity, demographics, and our financial situation can influence our sleep problems. This review explores these two models by explaining each research study that's relevant to them, trying to understand how they're connected. Then, I'll critique each study to point out what they do well and what they don't.\n\nInsomnia can be broken down into three main categories: it's either a sleep disorder itself, connected to another mental health issue, or caused by something else like a medical condition or a substance. Primary sleep disorders are either Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, which are basically the two groups of sleep disorders. Dyssonmias, which are linked to starting and staying asleep, include things like Primary Insomnia, where you can't sleep properly, and Primary Hypersomnia, where you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy involves weird episodes of automatic behavior during REM sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias are sleep disorders that involve weird behaviors or physical things happening during sleep, like Nightmares, Sleep Terrors, or Sleepwalking. I'm focusing on insomnia and some Primary sleep disorders in this review, especially in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model looks at how our genes, what we inherit, and our body's physical stuff affect our sleep. It's like, our brain has special cells called neurons in the hypothalamus that control our sleep and wakefulness. One study used mice and found that these neurons have special receptors that help us sleep and wake up. If these receptors get messed up, it can cause problems with sleep. The study showed that a special medicine that interacts with these receptors can actually help us sleep better. This study is cool because it shows that our genes and environment can affect our sleep. If we inherited something that affects our sleep receptors, it could mess with our ability to sleep properly, which is a big deal because it can impact our daily life, like school, work, and even doing boring tasks.",
            "So, let's dive into the three main areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First off, we're going to define what CAPD is all about. Then we'll get into the diagnosis part, including all the telltale signs or \"red flags\" that a teacher should look out for. Finally, we'll wrap things up by talking about how a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can help out a student with CAPD.\n\nSo, CAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is basically how well your brain handles what you hear. It's a disorder where the central nervous system (CNS), aka your brain, can't process the sounds it receives properly. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain isn't doing its job to separate words or tell the difference between background noise and actual conversation.\n\nThe first recorded mention of what would eventually become CAPD was back in the 1950s when researchers came across a condition called \"auditory imperception\" when trying to figure out why some kids were having trouble with communication. It wasn't until 1954 that an Italian research team started working on tests for these kids, and by 1961, a Japanese researcher named Kimura came up with a model that explained how the brain works when we hear two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of ways: someone with it might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from or hearing them in space, or they might struggle to tell two or more sounds apart. They might also have a hard time recognizing patterns in sounds, or telling when someone is being sarcastic based on how they say something. It can also be tough for people with CAPD to put together all the sound clues they hear and make sense of them, or to figure out the order in which sounds are happening. And, yeah, it can even be hard for them to tell when one sound is blocking out another.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, you need to do a bunch of tests that check how well someone's brain is processing sounds. These tests are usually done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists, and they might involve questionnaires, observing how someone reacts to different sounds, or even recording what's going on inside their ear and measuring how they respond to it. There's no one test that works really well for figuring out CAPD, and we still don't know what causes it. But these tests can give us an idea of what's going on.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that using a disguise to fool people for a long time can actually trap you if you don't shed that fake identity. The thing is, when you finally stop pretending, it can lead to some real problems. You might find yourself all alone because the people around you got hurt by your deception. It's a tough decision: do you save yourself, or the people who got caught up in your trick? Some people might be pretty chill about it, but others will be super mad. The more complicated thing is when the disguise is about switching genders. It's like, why do people feel the need to pretend to be someone else? In the case of Viola, she's just trying to protect herself by pretending to be a guy. She does it to avoid getting hurt, like \"I'll take you to a captain who helped me hide my feminine side so I could work for this noble count.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.247-249)\n\nSo Viola comes up with a plan and pretends to be a dude, which actually works, but it also makes her miss out on the support of the women around her. To make things worse, Olivia thinks she's actually talking to a guy named Sebastian, not a girl, and falls for it. Plus, Viola's also got some unrequited feelings for Orsino, but she's got to hide it because she's pretending to be a guy, like \"boy, you've told me a million times you don't like women like me.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.260-261)\n\nIt's a bit weird to look at it from today's perspective, but Twelfth Night might be saying that deception can actually help people figure out their real feelings. Maybe Olivia and Orsino have secret desires that Viola/Cesario makes them confront. For example, is Olivia really into Cesario because he's a guy, or is she secretly into girls? I think it's probably not the case, because Olivia's character is probably just making fun of people who judge others based on looks. We can tell because she quickly goes from liking Cesario to loving Sebastian, and starts treating Viola like a sister instead of a love interest, like \"you're her, a sister.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.315)",
            "People have been talking about how brutal the German colonial rule was, especially the way they dealt with the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. But it's not as simple as saying that's all the German colonies were like. They were all pretty different places with different policies and ruling styles. Even their educational systems varied, and it's not like they all followed the same rules. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that there were a bunch of educated and literate Africans living there. The German's efforts to educate people in Kamerun and other colonies even got some good reviews from writers back then.\n\nBut then you have South West Africa (now Namibia), which was a totally different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government built schools and tried to help the locals get an education, the task of teaching the natives in South West Africa was basically left to some missionary groups with not a lot of government support. The government did put a lot of resources towards teaching Europeans in the colony, though, and they set up schools and regulated the missionary schools even more. These choices had a big impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies had a bunch of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa the majority of the population remained pretty much untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. It's been argued that this was partly because of a bunch of different social, political, and economic factors.\n\nA lot of people have written about education in the German colonies, but most of their stuff is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of the earlier stuff just described the educational systems in the different colonies, while later writers did more in-depth studies and compared the systems between colonies. One of the most important studies is Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that the main reason for the differences between the two colonies is because of the number of settlers living in South West Africa. Compared to the other German colonies, South West Africa had a pretty nice climate, but a lot of it is desert. The number of European settlers in South West Africa was pretty high, too - by 1913, there were around 15,000 of them, while there were only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next biggest settler population.",
            "The way we understand and categorize Popular Music has changed a lot over the past 100 years, with the field growing so complex that it's hard to keep track of all the different genres. To make matters even more confusing, many of the major genres, like rock, country, and jazz, have spawned countless sub-genres, making it tough to pin them down. One of the most exciting and expressive genres to have emerged in the past 40 years is Heavy Metal rock, which has become incredibly diverse and adaptable. Heavy Metal music has a knack for expressing a wide range of emotions, mostly leaning towards the darker and more intense end of the spectrum. \n\nAs the genre began to take shape, people quickly realized its potential for flexibility and started experimenting with different styles, which led to the creation of sub-genres, and eventually, sub-sub-genres. Today, the heavy metal scene is so vast that it's difficult to define what exactly heavy metal is. It has managed to incorporate elements from other genres, but like everything, it has its roots somewhere. To truly understand the diverse metal music out there, you need to grasp the core of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is, in many ways, a movement that's deeply connected to the darker side of human experience. It's often described as a \"more is more\" philosophy, where music is amplified to be louder, more intense, and more theatrical. Metal musicians are known for their incredible technical skills, which is evident in their music. Moreover, the heavy metal scene has a long history of being influenced by psychedelic substances, which, in the 1970s, led to the creation of wild, otherworldly sounds. Many metal bands have tapped into the dark, visceral qualities that characterized the Romantic Era, adding to the genre's mystique. The lyrics of songs like the ones by the Beatles, in their song Helter Skelter, showcase the darker side of the music, which has become a staple of the movement.",
            "I'm totally immersed in the world of Henri Rousseau's art, but it's not just his paintings that I'm obsessed with - it's the story behind them too. Like, a few decades before the Surrealist artists started painting their trippy works, Rousseau was already churning out his own dreamlike masterpieces. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is all about a chick who's stoked about the wonders she sees in a far-off land, but it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as an artist. See, he always wanted to get recognized and loved by his fellow artists and art lovers, but that came with a major internal conflict - should he follow the rules and paint like everyone else, or be a rebel and do his own thing?\n\nTo fully get what's going on with The Dream, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life story. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a French town called Laval. His dad was a rich hardware dealer, and growing up, Rousseau didn't have any fancy art training. Instead, he worked a regular job for France as a toll collector until he was forty. Yeah, he had a pretty cool nickname - douanier, or customs inspector, even though that's not what he really did. Tragedy struck when his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their babies. He was left with just one kid, Julia, and a ton of sadness. Painting became his escape and new beginning. Unlike all the other artists of his time who were painting idealized country folk, Rousseau was a folk painter through and through, with hopes and dreams just like the average dude.\n\nRousseau's desperation to be accepted by the art world makes sense when you consider that he was basically a newbie, started late, and was competing with all these other talented artists who were already making a name for themselves. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was getting famous that Rousseau started getting recognition too. According to art expert Jan Gordon, they were like total opposites - Matisse was afraid of painting stuff that was cliché, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would finally take him seriously as a real artist.",
            "A lot of smart people have argued that there's a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, or truth and beauty. I think it's because there's a reason at the core of this. John Keats said in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn most things in life from school or experience, but it seems like we get into ethics and aesthetics without being taught that way. Both ethics and aesthetics are more like describing things than telling people what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are really just trying to figure out why something is beautiful or moral, rather than making rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nGet to the point, talking about art or morals can never fully capture what's good or beautiful. For example, a discussion about the Mona Lisa might talk about stuff like the background and foreground, but it won't explain why it's good art. When people talk about their favorite work of art or literature, they usually say something like \"There's just something about it\" before trying to explain it. I think both art and morals can never be fully put into words. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how much we describe a work of art, there's something left over that can't be explained. I think ethics has the same property. Wittgenstein said that ethics can't be expressed, it's transcendental.\n\nI think morality and art are connected because we experience them in the same way, at a deep level that can't be fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean says, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. Maybe moral standards don't apply to other art forms like music, but they seem to be just as relevant to literature as they are to real life. Living involves values, and literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's got its own unique vibe going on, blending cultures from the foothills of the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. It's like this cool mix of cultures that flows from Köln along the Rhine River, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a rich cultural history, it's no surprise that Germany's got its roots in various tribes and sources. \n\nGermania's basically the ancestral homeland of the Germans, but the origins of its name are super disputed among scholars. Some think it comes from the Germanic Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. The Roman historian Tacitus said that, and he even wrote a book about it back in 98 AD. Julius Caesar, on the other hand, used the word 'Germanus' in his commentary on the Gallic Wars to describe the Germanic tribes he fought against. He got the word from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the people he'd already conquered and those he hadn't. In one of his books, Julius Caesar writes about how the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly waging war with the Gauls. Others believe the name 'Germanus' comes from the spear they used in battle, called a ger, or maybe from the Old Irish word garim, which means 'to shout', implying that the Germans were super loud or rowdy.\n\nTacitus wrote in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' that the Germans were a pretty distinct bunch, not really mixed with other cultures. He thought it was crazy that anyone would leave their homes in Asia or Africa to move to Germany, with its wild landscapes, harsh weather, and grumpy vibe. The Romans would send their soldiers to trade and conquer Germania, but they mostly stuck to their own empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the border of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood staring, my mind was a complete blank slate, taking in everything in front of me without really processing it.  I was just kinda zoning out to the whole scene.  It was like my thoughts were racing by so fast I couldn't even catch up to them.  It was like I was just observing everything without really thinking about it.  I mean, my brain was totally engaged, but not really connected to anything. \n\nI had this art book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", that I'd bought based on some advice from an artist I was working with.  I've been wanting to learn how to draw forever - since I was six - and this book was the key.  It teaches you all the basics, from what a pencil is to how our brains interpret lines.  One trick it shows you is to draw a square frame around the thing you're looking at to make it easier to understand.  So, like, if you're staring at a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, you just imagine a simple plane and that's it.  I'd heard about that technique, but when I tried it, I just couldn't wrap my head around it.  The picture was too overwhelming, so I just stood there and stared in awe.  I was trying to tap into some level of artistic vision, like Picasso's blue phase or Monet's love of greenery.  I was feeling pretty pretentious, like I was on the verge of creating something amazing.  I'd call it \"Work in Brown\".\n\nI started to pick up my pencil, my hand moving towards the paper with a plan.  I was ready to unleash my creativity.  But then my hand just sort of jerked back, like I'd lost my train of thought.  I tried again, but my hand just slapped the toilet handle.  I was trying to work, but my hand was just kinda spasming out.  I was staring at some gross brown stuff in the toilet, and I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  I picked up the mop, hesitated for a second, and then just stood there, staring.  My tie was all bunched up around my neck, and I was starting to feel pretty annoyed.  I mean, who leaves this stuff in the bathroom?  I thought about just giving up and walking away, but then I picked up the toilet paper roll and started mummifying my hand with it.  It was like I was in a daze, just going through the motions.  Finally, I dipped my hand into the toilet bowl, like I was some kind of crazy person.  I guess I just wasn't feeling it that day.",
            "The scary truth is that teenagers are dying behind the wheel at an alarming rate. A bunch of things combine to make driving a deadly trap for new drivers. The National Institutes of Health say that one big part of the problem is that the teen brain just isn't ready to handle driving. They're also super inexperienced, which doesn't just cause more fatal accidents, but also makes them way more likely to get into rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt's no surprise that teens do way worse when they're driving with their friends. I mean, who doesn't know that they're always together in the car? A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center showed a pretty cool correlation: the older the passenger, the fewer the car accidents. Some states like California have tried to make it safer for teen drivers by introducing temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and stop them from driving with their friends.\n\nBut let's be real, these temporary licenses are just a temporary fix. The real issue is that younger drivers, as a group, just aren't ready for the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He's done research that shows people under 19-20 are super into taking risks just for the thrill of it. That makes sense, so it's probably a good idea to delay getting a driver's license until that need for a rush starts to fade. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing more and more fatal accidents, and the death toll is probably going to be huge in the next few years. By 2010, all the kids born during the Baby Boom will be old enough to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nMaking new laws about this would be pretty straightforward. Schools could still teach driver's ed, but no one under 18 could drive. A provisional permit could still be issued, but only after a certain number of practice hours with an adult. The number of hours could be the same as most states require (in California, it's 6 hours of driving with an adult and 50 hours of practice). Because the problem is everywhere, making national laws would be a good way to protect teens all over the country. It's not a new idea, but it's one that could make a big difference.",
            "I spent the day going through the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films. I was really into the trick films that they had, there were 15 of them from '95 to '01. They mostly use editing to make it seem like magic. I watched them all and took notes on how they work. Most of the trick films are pretty straightforward and predictable, but a few of the later ones had some really cool stuff that didn't follow the rules. The trick films from way back when are all pretty simple - they're shot from one angle, don't move the camera, and stick to long and medium shots. But a few of the early 20th century films were like rebels and didn't follow these rules. They started doing things like using multiple shots.\n\nOne weird thing that all the trick films have in common is that they're all shot in a little box on stage. The camera doesn't move, it just stays in one place the whole time. This is really obvious in most of the old films, and it's something that they got from the theatre and magic shows. The problem with using a stage is that the people in the film can only move side to side, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in that old film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\", the actors come in from the side and just move back and forth. Even when they go out of the frame, the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nAll the trick films I watched were shot from really far away - a long shot, basically - and sometimes a medium shot. They never used close-up shots at all. This is because of the way that theatre and magic shows work - the whole performance is set up on a stage and the audience sees the whole thing at once. In most old films, the actors just stood in the middle of the screen and didn't move towards the camera, so there were no close-ups.\n\nMost of the trick films from back then were really short, like a minute or less. This is because they were just one big shot in the viewer's eyes, but actually consisted of several different shots all stuck together to make the illusion work. For example, in that old film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\", if you look closely, you can see where the shot with the fake head starts, even though the whole film is just one shot to the viewer. The trick films are mostly just short little magic tricks, but they're still really cool to watch.",
            "So, you wanna know about John Taylor of Caroline?  He was a total believer in that whole Republican thing, even though he was more of a farmer than anything else (he even dabbled in politics for a bit).  He was super dedicated to his causes, especially when it came to personal freedom and government.  His love for the simple life was basically the basis for all of his opinions on, like, pretty much everything.  He thought that farming was the key to making the government work right, and that's why he was always going on about how it should be the best career out there.\n\nTaylor thought that the US had a chance to create this awesome system of government because they didn't have any old traditions to mess things up.  He believed in the natural rights of people, and that they're all connected - if one is taken away, the others lose value too.  He thought the government should stay out of it and not mess with those rights.  He had this weird idea that in the \"state of nature,\" the strong and mean people were the ones who got ahead, but that's not how it should be in a civilized society.\n\nTo create this perfect society, Taylor thought the government should be all about acknowledging the good and bad in people.  He was super strict about his ideas on right and wrong, and he said that because government is run by people, it's gotta be human too.  He said that good principles are about protecting private property, helping out farmers, and keeping capitalism in check, and that a government based on those principles would work just fine no matter who's in charge.  But, he thought self-interest was a major problem, and that it's only bad when it's used to hurt others.\n\nTaylor was all about keeping the government small and limited, just like the Constitution says.  He didn't want the feds to have any more power than they absolutely needed, 'cause he knew that would just make 'em expensive and, like, super controlling.  But at the same time, he thought that just following the Constitution literally without thinking about what the people who wrote it meant could be a bad idea.  He also thought the Declaration of Independence was way more important than the Constitution, 'cause it talks about the US being a bunch of separate states rather than just one big nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, we noticed that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. That was pretty disappointing, and it's hard to figure out why that happened. You'd think that with winter coming to a New England campus, people would be less likely to commute by bike or on foot, which could explain part of the drop. Also, December's a crazy time with everyone wrapping up schoolwork and grades, which might make people forget all about filling out that commuter log. On top of that, December's the start of the holiday season, and everyone's busy getting ready for a long break from campus. When classes start up again in late January, it makes sense that log submissions would be low that month too. But none of that really explains why submissions were so low in February. Maybe projects like this one just naturally lose steam after the initial excitement wears off. So, we came up with the Carpool Challenge Week in March to try and get people excited again, and it worked - we saw an increase in log submissions that month. One of the biggest challenges we faced was keeping the project going when people naturally lose interest, and dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that are a part of higher education. \n\nAnother problem we encountered with this project (and probably any similar one) is that people love the freedom and independence that comes with driving their cars. That's just part of our culture, so we needed to offer incentives to get people to switch to alternative modes of transportation. We gave out a bunch of gift cards to local places, but it would've been cool to see how bigger prizes like a bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car might've boosted participation. That could've helped us avoid that dip in engagement we saw. We kept the same prizes throughout the project, which might not have been the best idea. If we'd announced bigger and better prizes as the project went on - like adding a bike in December and a car in January - I bet people would've been way more into it.",
            "So, you're probably wondering what an ETF is. Well, it's like a hybrid between an index fund and a stock – it tracks an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets, but trades like a single stock on the exchange. It gives you the benefits of owning a bunch of different things (like an index fund) and the flexibility to sell short, buy on margin, and even buy just one share, just like with a stock. And the best part? The fees for ETFs are way lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides – you gotta pay a commission for each trade, just like with stocks. Plus, there are a ton of different ETFs to choose from, which is awesome, but also kinda overwhelming. When picking an ETF, it's smart to really think about whether the benefits, like diversification, are actually working for you, and to what extent.\n\nWe're gonna take a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for about 63.6% of its assets. It'd be a real pain to go over all the holdings, so we're just gonna focus on the top 10. Here are the top 10 holdings and their share of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo figure out how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we're gonna use their current percentages to calculate their contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, like if the portfolio was made up of just these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. We got the Beta and Return calculations below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's pretty clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a higher return (6.11% higher) and lower Beta (0.12 lower) than the ETF. But here's the thing – it's possible that these two portfolios aren't actually that different from each other.\n\nTo check if they are actually different, we're gonna calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF's standard deviation.",
            "I was reading about Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" and I'm convinced it's one of his best works. In the poem, Poe mentions the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a term that he apparently picked up from Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island off the northern coast of Britain that the ancient Greeks thought was the edge of the known world, but people think Poe got it from someone else too. Poe was really into German writers like Goethe, and it shows. \n\nThis connection is a big deal because it proves how well-read Poe was. Karl J. Arndt, a writer who studied Poe and Goethe, noticed that their poems were similar and even thought Poe was copying Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature has a whole section on Goethe, who was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. There's a poem within Faust called \"The King of Thule\" that's pretty dark and talks about a king who loses his wife and then drowns his sorrows in booze. The king's story is kind of like the main character in \"Dream-Land\", maybe even a dark mirror image of Poe's own struggles with drinking. Goethe's Faust was even turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in another poem.\n\nPoe mentioned Thule twice in his writings, first in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and then again in \"Dream-Land\" as the start and end of the poem. It's like \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a place called Thule that's dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends. It's like he's stepping into Goethe's world. Goethe was a big deal in Poe's time, and Poe even admired Alfred Tennyson, who was friends with Goethe. Poe probably knew about Goethe's work through all the reproductions of his work that were happening after it was first published.",
            "If a customer was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store under California law, could they get punitive damages if the store manager, Paul Martin, was acting with malice because he was told twice about the spill but didn't clean it up for half an hour because he was eating dinner?  I don't think a judge would just dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages without a fight. To get punitive damages, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, would need to show that the store manager acted on purpose with a bad intention to cause harm, or that he acted really badly and didn't care about the consequences. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known that not cleaning the spill would be a problem because there were already a bunch of people slipping and falling in the store before her accident, and he still didn't do anything about it. Palmer might have a point, but it's not super strong because there were only six slip-and-fall incidents that year and Martin still didn't do enough to keep the store safe.\n\nIt looks like Martin was pretty clueless because on October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told him about the applesauce spill, and Martin basically said he was too busy eating dinner to deal with customer complaints. Then, at 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also told him about the spill, and he said the same thing. It wasn't until 30 minutes later, at 5:30 pm, that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. Before Palmer's accident, there had already been five slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 at the store. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're wondering if we should file a motion to get rid of the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, if someone gets hurt because the other person didn't do what they were supposed to do (like keep the store safe), they can get punitive damages if the other person acted really badly and didn't care about the consequences. The law says that's malice if the person knew what they were doing was going to hurt someone, or if they were really reckless and didn't care about the consequences. It's like when someone knows that what they're doing is going to hurt someone, but they do it anyway. That's not cool.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took an Islam course at CBC, where discussions often revolved around whether Islam is a hostile religion.  In my opinion, this question is more relevant now than ever.  Observing the mass media's shift from a hostile view of Islam to over-the-top tolerance since 9/11 has been pretty mind-blowing.  Back in 2001, it was unthinkable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam, running for office.\n\nThe story of the Prophet's life really fascinates me.  I've learned that it's almost like a biography of a hero, but it contradicts what I thought I knew about Muhammad.  According to history, I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam by conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them, but the biography portrays him as a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  People were drawn to his teachings because of some kind of inner light or something, not because they were coerced.\n\nIt's also weird how the stories of Muhammad's life have some parallels to the story of Jesus – like the time he fed a bunch of people with a small amount of food and had some left over.  I get the feeling that the writers wanted to make Muhammad out to be this super humble guy who didn't need to prove anything, but just lived life with integrity and performed miracles because that's who he was.  It's like they're watering down the real miracle of Jesus and trying to ride his coattails.\n\nI've also noticed that the biography includes a lot of stories that seem to be about providing proof that people converted to Islam on their own free will.  But the problem is that these stories are often based on second-hand accounts and seem suspicious because of that.  It's like they're trying to build a case for the validity of the stories, but it actually makes them seem less believable.\n\nWhat really gets me is that they're trying to paint Muhammad as this super nice and wise guy who's above reproach.  But history says that's not true, and I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It's like the original message of Jesus got lost in the shuffle as Christianity evolved after he was gone.  If we look at the big picture, it seems like Christianity has been moving further and further away from its roots.  I think we're starting to see a shift, though.  There are more people who care about the real story of Jesus and the ideas he stood for.  While some folks might stick with tradition, I think they'll be outnumbered.  Christians are becoming more aware of their history, and this awareness is going to keep growing.  It's like a longing will start to build up, to figure out what's real and what's been added to the story over the years.  It might take a long time - decades or even centuries - but eventually, Christianity will swing back to its original form.  A movement will emerge, and it will start stripping away all the extra stuff that's built up over time.  It's like the clock will start ticking backwards.  When this happens, people in the US and Europe will start to focus on what Jesus really taught, and the church will be there to guide them.  But here's the thing - because we're going back to basics, we'll see a lot less variety in what people believe.  Instead of all the different branches of Christianity, we'll see a lot more things in common.  History is full of examples of this kind of reversal.  Think about how the Roman Empire used to persecute Christians, but later became Christian itself.  Or how our country went from having African-American slaves to having African-American leaders.  A similar reversal is coming for Christianity, and it will be a journey back to the source.  To make this happen, people need to start seeing Jesus' words as metaphors, not literal rules.  So, what happened to the original message of Jesus after he was gone?\n\nLooking back, it's pretty obvious that Jesus was a part of the Jewish tradition.  When the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people didn't all agree on the same thing.  They split into different groups - the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and just regular people.  Monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the importance of the Hebrew scriptures were all key parts of Judaism at that time.  It's interesting to think about how different the Jewish people were, and how that laid the groundwork for Christianity.",
            "I think The Jungle shows how people's true nature is deep down selfish and self-centered. All they care about is making their lives as good as possible and not really considering anyone else. The Jungle proves this in lots of ways. It's super obvious with the owners and managers of the huge factories. All they want to do is make their companies as huge and awesome as possible, no matter who gets hurt or what gets in their way. They just don't care about anything else. Upton Sinclair's writing paints a picture of the super bad stuff they're causing by making pollution, like all the smoke and gross stuff coming from the factories. He shows that the owners don't care about anyone or anything that gets hurt. They don't even care about the people working for them or the animals living near the factories. They're all about making money and don't care who they have to step on to get it.\n\nThe owners and managers were also super bad to their employees, making them work crazy hours and then just laying them off without warning or helping them find a new job. Back when The Jungle was set, there weren't any laws to protect workers, so the owners and managers could do whatever they wanted. The people working in Packingtown were basically expected to deal with the awful conditions all the time, both at work and at home. There were some unions trying to help, but they were more about making money off the workers than actually helping them. The workers were treated so badly and had no way out of the system that they were basically slaves, and Sinclair said that's just as bad as the old slave system.",
            "Many authors use different techniques to influence their readers' feelings about important topics, and some are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of using these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs words that don't normally go together to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he adds meaning to a symbol, then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald uses the latter technique with lots of colors, like gold, green, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for colors, specifically white and gray, then uses that meaning to give readers a certain feeling about an important thing.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white and gray is really interesting. He gives them a meaning of uniformity, with white being fancy and high class, and gray being old and faded. He sets up this meaning right at the beginning of the novel by using them a lot. People like Daisy and Jordan are always dressed in white - almost everyone is, actually. Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine looks like she's been powdered into a milky white complexion. The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, and the halls are a gaudy mess of bright colors. Fitzgerald takes it further by using these colors on everyday, unimportant things, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down the white canyons of lower New York, and when he makes his schedule, the names of people at Gatsby's parties are just gray names.\n\nHe even uses these colors to describe plain or regular people and places: Jordan and Daisy had a white girlhood together, there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes, the kid on the train is gray, and the dog seller is an old gray guy. After Fitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray, he uses them to show that certain subjects are unimportant or uniform. He starts this with Daisy, after a long time without using these colors, he describes her as wearing white in a little white roadster, and suddenly she seems less like a person and more like just something that Gatsby wants and longs for. He uses more of this technique with Daisy to give her the impression of being a more uniform addition, like when there's a gray haze around her fur collar, or when she's wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "I recently looked into San Diego County's agricultural scene, and it's totally thriving thanks to its awesome climate. The county is producing a ton of awesome stuff, like juicy tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and spicy peppers. It's super popular for organic community supported agriculture food, with a bunch of local organizations having long waiting lists for their products, especially organic eggs and milk. Many of these farms also offer tours and activities like hiking and birdwatching, which is a win-win for landowners who can benefit from government programs and still get to enjoy the outdoors. It's like getting paid to be a nature lover!\n\nThe cool thing about organic farming is that it lets you have a super diverse ecosystem with tons of wildlife and plants, since you don't use any harsh chemicals. However, it can be a bit more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming. You need to work harder to keep pests and weeds under control and fertilize the soil naturally, and sometimes you end up losing more crops than you would with traditional methods. Plus, a small organic farm can't compete with the efficiency of a big operation. But, there are some other practices that can help the environment and wildlife, like planting cover crops and strategic grazing rotation, which can be more expensive. That's why it might be helpful for landowners to get some financial assistance or expert advice on how to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land I chose for this scenario is a 160-acre plot in Potrero, an area in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. It's located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but it covers over a hundred species of plants and animals, some of which are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher, and others that might be listed soon, like the burrowing owls. This land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s.\n\nI picked this piece of land from a real estate website and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might be able to do to cut costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I found an organic farm in the same area that I used as a model for this scenario.",
            "When it comes to negotiation, culture plays a really big role. Culture isn't just one thing; it's also about what it's not and what it means. It's not a single, uniform thing, and it's definitely not the same for everyone. Think about saying things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - these are way too broad and don't make any sense. It's actually more helpful to understand what culture means in the context of a specific situation and how it'll affect the negotiation. When you're dealing with a different culture, you naturally compare it to your own, and that's when things get interesting.\n\nTrying to get to know a different culture or mindset can be like studying its history or realizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change it, you just have to accept it as it is and work within its boundaries, especially when you're negotiating and you're in a weaker position. If you're in a foreign territory, respecting their traditions and beliefs can help you get past any cultural obstacles and move the negotiation forward.\n\nNow, here's the thing: culture isn't just about countries or nationalities. Companies have their own culture too, and it can be totally different from one company to another. For instance, some companies are super strict about work hours, while others are super relaxed. You can see this in how they dress, how they communicate, and even who they hire. Some companies really encourage employees to be philanthropic, while others only let them do it through certain approved charities. Looking at how American companies differ from each other (and even within the same company, depending on the region or urban vs. suburban) shows just how diverse culture can be.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important, because they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or community harmony is a big deal, you won't publicly shame your company or boss to get ahead in negotiations. On the other hand, if a culture values getting the best deal possible, they won't settle for anything less. Knowing these generalities can help you prepare for negotiations, but it's also helpful to get to know your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "There's this crazy quote from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" It gets referenced by St. Anselm in his argument about God's existence, and our other dude, Thomas Aquinas, seems to agree with him. Since we're gonna be talking about their arguments, we'll just assume they're both on the same page about the existence of God, specifically the God from the Bible. If we're talking about some random God-type, it wouldn't be a fair comparison, so let's just roll with it. \n\nThat said, I think both of these guys make some good points, but neither really lays out a solid, all-around case for believing in God. To understand this, let's break down Anselm's argument first. Anselm's all about finding proof of God within yourself, kinda like how you can know something's true just by thinking about it. He says that because God exists in our minds, we can't even imagine a world without him. It's a pretty weird concept, but basically, he's saying that you don't need any outside evidence to believe in God – just your own thoughts. He's talking about faith, you know, when you believe in something even if there's no concrete proof. \n\nNow, Aquinas is all about using logic and facts to prove God's existence, no faith required. This would be super helpful for getting new people into Christianity, since you wouldn't have to convince them to believe in something they can't see. Aquinas breaks down five different ways to prove God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He's all about how using logic can show you that God has to exist. Think of it like trying to finish a puzzle – if you know all the other pieces, you can figure out what the missing one looks like even if you can't see it.",
            "Somewhere around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who'd later be known as Buddha was born. He'd eventually give up the world and get enlightened, and his teachings became the foundation for Buddhism—the orthodox branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. The religion is over two thousand five hundred years old, and it looks really different from what it was like when Buddha was alive. You can see this in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, where they celebrate the annual water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular people both participate, and it's got some spiritual significance, even though Buddha never taught about anything like that. These differences run all the way from surface-level traditions to the core ideas that make up the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community has changed its core principles from both the monk's perspective and the regular person's. This happened due to both external and internal forces, some good and some bad.\n\nIn this discussion, we'll use some terms a lot. When we say 'internal force,' we mean something that comes from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether someone's a monk or not. An 'external force' is any influence from outside the Buddhist world. A 'hostile force' is something that harms or tries to harm the Buddhist community, usually because of a negative view of Buddhism. A 'benign force' is any influence that doesn't want to hurt or help Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other anyway. These terms will come up a lot as we talk about this.\n\nFirst off, it's essential to understand the basics of the religion—the core ideas that make up Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists look to the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha for guidance. The Dhamma is basically made up of the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for monks and regular people, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper, more philosophical ideas of Buddhism. Concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the idea that life is suffering), and Anicca (how everything's temporary) are all part of this. Recognizing these ideas can help you escape Sansara—the cycle of death and rebirth, which keeps going on and on. Along with Sansara, when you become enlightened, you'll also break free from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules laid out for how to live your life. For regular people, there are five basic rules (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't misbehave, and don't take drugs). For monks, there are many more rules to follow. The core idea of Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico had this crazy long-standing feud that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  It was like, the ultimate rivalry, and it really came to a head during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The US basically attacked Mexico, took over Texas and the Southwest, and it was a pretty intense clash.  Before the First World War, they were still having all these issues, but it finally started to die down.  This whole thing started because Americans and Mexicans had totally different ideas about stuff like religion, culture, and traditions, and they also had major disagreements over material things (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \nIt's not just the US and Mexico - lots of countries that share borders tend to have these kinds of rivalries.  The US and Mexico are actually kind of like many other countries that have been stuck in these long-term rivalries with their neighbors.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said something pretty interesting, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can you find long-lasting American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  These countries are basically right next to the US, and they've been at odds with the US for a while now.  Other countries in Latin America, on the other hand, have gotten along pretty well with the US.\n\nOne of the big issues was that the US and Mexico had totally different ideas about religion - and this has been a major problem in lots of countries throughout history.  Sally Frahm (2001) pointed out that Americans used to be super opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries (p.86).  It's kind of like how the Cold War was this huge ideological struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, except in this case, it wasn't about politics, but about whether they were Protestant or Catholic.  This whole thing started because the English and Spanish had a bunch of distrust, and the US and Mexico just inherited that.  This made it really hard for them to get along.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted up 17 different disputes between the US and Mexico during this 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes were about territory and border problems, like bandits and outlaws crossing the border.  The US and Mexico finally started to calm down when Mexico became super dependent on the US, and then they both started to focus more on economic stuff rather than expanding territory (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took a drastic turn due to a health condition that I never expected to affect me. I was a nurse at the time, and I had chosen that career path to guarantee a sense of security that I never had as a child. The constant advice I received as a kid, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" made me think that nursing was a safe bet. So, I put aside my dreams of being a scientist or journalist – a mix of both would've been awesome – and became a nurse.\n\nNow, here I am, 46 years old, single, and living on Social Security Disability after fifteen years. I've got nothing left to call my own, and every day is a struggle to stay afloat. My life feels like an ongoing battle for security, safety, and self-respect. Yet, amidst this chaos, I've learned one thing for sure: without the help of my family and a few genuine friends, I wouldn't have made it through these years. And trust me, when disaster strikes, you won't feel as strong as you thought you'd be.\n\nMy point is, emergencies will come in all shapes and sizes – and there's no way to prepare for everything. No matter how much you prepare, some situations are just too big to handle on your own.\n\nI agree that we should stop putting all our eggs in the US government's basket, as it's crumbling anyway. However, I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other, rather than building individual fallout shelters. The idea of rugged individualism that the Conservatives talk about is a myth; it was actually our ancestors' compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that kept them going through tough times. Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies didn't make it to the coast alone – they relied on their community.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare. I'm prepared – I've got a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and all the essentials. But it's not just about being prepared; it's also about building connections with your neighbors. Get to know the people around you, and work together to make your community stronger. If you've got the land and resources for a small farm, canning or preserving your own food is a fantastic idea, as is a wood stove – just make sure you don't live in an apartment.",
            "So, why do living things evolve the way they do? Is there some hidden force guiding the direction of change? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said zoologists were just starting to imagine describing organic forms in math terms, but we're not much further along today. Recently, math has been applied to the way shell-building creatures, like snails, grow and change over time (like their great-great-grandparents). Our study is exploring how math can help us figure out what makes the shapes of snail shells change. We took X-rays of snail species to measure the patterns that make up their shells, then plugged those numbers into this super cool computer program called CerioShell. We used those results to imagine what snail shells might look like if they'd evolved differently. We're combining that with some hands-on experiments to understand how shell shapes change over millions of years.\n\nImagine a snail shell as a spiral tube that grows and grows over time - it's like a big, twisty road that winds its way through space. Each twist is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a central axis (like a big, invisible pole) that runs through the shell's middle. The speed at which the whorls get bigger can vary, and there's a clear line between each twist, called a suture. In most shells, the biggest twist is the last one (the body whorl), and the rest are called the spire. The top point of the spire is the apex, and the bottom is the base. The snail sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different angles - from the top, from the bottom, from the front, or from the back. Usually, people look at shells with the aperture facing them and the apex pointing up.\n\nHere's a way to count the twists: first, look at the shell from the top, then find where the first twist starts. Draw a line that splits the shell in two, and then count the twists from there - you can even estimate a quarter of a twist if you're not sure. A shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through time and space as the snail builds its shell. By tracking the path of the hole, you can use math to understand how the shell grows. This lets you play around with different shell-building rules and see how they would affect the snail's shell shape.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has been pretty much the same for the past ten years.  It's weird because the country is doing okay on other things like getting clean water and sanitation, but it's really struggling to meet its targets for child and maternal health by 2015.  I'm gonna get into the reasons for this below, and they show that the country needs to improve its whole health system instead of just focusing on individual programs.\n\nIt's cool that Indonesia has gotten better at having skilled health workers at births, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  But what's strange is that this number includes traditional workers like midwives who can't do much if things get complicated.  So, the improvements in this area aren't as great as they seem, and there's still lots to be done.  The number of kids under five who get treated for diarrhea by a health pro has actually gone down, and the data on postnatal care is sketchy, but it's clear that this is a problem too.  We're talking low rates all over the country.\n\nC-section rates are way too low at about 4%, and that's not the only thing that's concerning.  The rates are way higher in cities (like 7%) than in rural areas (only 2%).  This shows that healthcare services are basically only available in cities.  Another problem is that some people can't access healthcare services because they can't afford it.  There's a huge gap in service use between the poorest and richest people in the country.\n\nNow we're talking about what to do next to improve neonatal and maternal care.  The big question is how to actually get more people access to healthcare services.  Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or strengthen its whole healthcare system instead of just focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for moms and babies?  I think program-specific approaches are tempting because they have clear goals and can produce quick results.  But there are some downsides.  One problem is that when we focus too much on one area, other areas don't get enough funding or resources.  Another problem is that all these separate programs can create a lot of extra work and duplication of services.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulously detailed descriptions and focus on the lives of the upper class during that era.  Two notable exceptions, however, are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels stray from the typical tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which helps to bring the characters to life and reveal their inner thoughts and emotions in a more profound way. \n\nOne of the most memorable scenes from an Oliver Twist passage reads: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n\nThese novels often use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, but the specifics vary in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often provide insight into Oliver's inner turmoil, what torments him, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. When Oliver relives the shooting in chapter 28, it's like he's reliving it in a dream, as he desperately searches for help. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his dire situation, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he's re-experiencing his despair without the initial shock of pain, now linked with ongoing fear. This scene raises questions about whose fault Oliver's misfortune is, as it's clear it wasn't his own. This reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable to even attempt to change the outcome, even when his life is at risk. This scene also implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin has broken him, making him accept his despair and lose his ability to react. \n\nIn another passage from Wuthering Heights, we find: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "It's been a couple years since I worked with a bunch of Elementary aged students in an after school program, teaching them whatever subject they were struggling with. My strengths were in English and reading, but I did my best to help them out in other areas too. I was asked to work one-on-one with this kid named Adrian - I think he was in either third or fourth grade - who was really struggling to read. It was weird, though; I realized that this kid was having some pretty strange problems. Some letters he could read perfectly, while others were completely off. I figured it had to be something other than what I thought at first, since he spoke perfect English, but I'm pretty sure he's Latino. I worked with him for a while, trying to figure out what was going on, but it wasn't until I met his mom that things became clear. She walked in on us while we were hanging out (I was basically babysitting him while the rest of the group was on a field trip), and it turned out she only spoke Spanish. Using my limited Spanish skills, we were able to communicate a little bit, and it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read, but he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. I don't know if that little epiphany helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to point out how language barriers can be a big problem in schools, especially here in California. I also want to show that it's not always as obvious as we think it is, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can be a huge obstacle for them. Everyone can agree on that, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There isn't just one answer. We've got dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of those things are going to fix this problem on their own.  The key is to combine them all.\n\nFirst off, I think the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all of them. Apparently, kids in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of people are scared of this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit from it. But that's not true. If we made these programs the norm, rather than the exception, all kids would be helped by it. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That wouldn't be realistic or fair. But I think it's a good idea to have bilingual tutors, aids, or whatever you want to call them. That way, we can make these programs work.",
            "We've all been told from a young age that there's something out there that's beyond our understanding. Some of us go to church, while others go to temple or try to figure things out on our own. Many of us just stick with what our parents taught us, but others reject it all and think there's just nothing more to life than what we can see and touch. We might adopt one set of values, then change our minds and switch to another. Whatever we choose, we're trying to figure out who we are through our own way of looking at the world. We're searching for a light in the dark to guide us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain pound against the tin roof while we both smoked. He said his favorite kind of bird was the cardinal, and just kept staring off into the rain. He looked really thin, and his clothes hung loose on him. I knew he was struggling. I felt scared and alone, and I didn't want to talk about how much I was going to miss him because it would make it too real for both of us. So I just hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just a few days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had kept him alive when the doctors thought it was time to let go, but it was just prolonging the pain. I didn't know what kind of God would do that. I didn't pray that night, and if there was a God, I thought he had stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him die, so I didn't. I wanted to remember my dad for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him go. So I just curled up in a ball and waited for the news. But nobody even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" seems like an oxymoron, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel - a mix of \"old\" and \"new.\" This genre has been both praised and criticized for its superficiality and its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create the prototype for the Gothic genre. By blending old theatrical clichés with new, naturalistic writing styles, Walpole created what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic literature often incorporates nods to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's release, the term \"gothic\" was already associated with various peoples, styles, and time periods, implying it was outdated and unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The combination of the theatrical, old-fashioned \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which provided readers with a more personal glimpse into character psychology, helped the Gothic genre endure and remain relevant, becoming both outdated and new to readers who came across it long after its initial writing.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which involves training a proper knight, is reinterpreted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry was essential to Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and contrasted it with the perceived lack of these ideals in their own society. By romanticizing and idealizing the chivalric past, Gothic writers attempted to improve the present. Given the tumultuous political climate when Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, and the unfair accusations he faced, it's possible that he believed the morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This idea is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as his royal status, his history of suffering, and his supposed bravery in the face of tragedy. The description of Frederic is riddled with traditional chivalric images, making him an exaggerated representation of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" trope, which would later become a hallmark of Gothic literature (Walpole 66).",
            "The flow of goods from the point when a customer places an order all the way back to the raw materials stage is referred to as supply chain management. Keith Oliver, a consultant, coined the term in 1982. He described the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain in order to meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently. The six key components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these six components to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production. It serves as the foundation for the entire chain. The production stage outlines the when, why, where, and how of production. To do this, managers need to figure out what customers want. One way to do that is by analyzing the market, which is the biggest indicator of customer demand. Once managers have a handle on customer demand, they can decide what products to produce and how many to make. They also need to decide where the products will be produced and which plant will be the best fit for volume and quality, all while keeping the customer's needs in mind. After that, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Every detail is crucial in the production process. If not planned carefully, it can end up costing the company a lot of time and money in the long run.\n\nFor instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a blueprint for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. Having a clear plan helps the company run smoothly and prevents confusion.\n\nThe second essential element in supply chain management is supply. It involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager needs to decide which division is best suited for the different processes of the product. They might also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity, which is the ability to provide high-quality products with flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "There's this wild sign on the street that says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". It's like something right out of a crazy dream. Ellen Page from Juno is standing on a corner, holding a cardboard sign with this unsettling message written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is this Southeast Asian country that's been ruled by a super oppressive government since 1962. They overthrew the government in a military coup, and things escalated quickly from there. In 2007, monks led some massive protests called the \"Saffron Revolution\" because of their bright orange robes. It was huge, with people from all over starting to take notice. At first, the government let them march, but then things got super violent - the military even broke into monasteries and attacked people. Journalists got arrested just for showing up, and a Japanese photographer named Kenji Nagai got killed for being in the middle of it all. The official death count is like, 13, but a high-ranking officer who defected from the army said there were thousands more. \n\nThis isn't new, man. Governments wanting to keep control over people has been going on forever. Ancient Roman emperors thought they were gods, Japanese emperors are basically considered divine, and our current prez, George W. Bush, has some weird connections to this Ted Haggard guy who's like the leader of some crazy group. There are so many examples of this - like that time in 1989 when people protested in Tiananmen Square and the Chinese government claimed only a few hundred died, but other sources say it was way more like 2,000-3,000. Then there was the Rwandan genocide where Hutu militias killed all these people, and of course, there was the whole \"Third Reich\" thing where Hitler and his crew went around killing Jews and others. It's all just super messed up.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his impressive lifespan, which allowed him to continually shape his orchestra and create new music. Although he's often not prominent on the piano in his compositions, Ellington's skill as a composer shines through in the rich and complex pieces he created that showed off each band member's abilities. He crafted the perfect setting for soloists to improvise, as well as tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted each musician's unique style. By doing this, he created a consistent tone for the orchestra and came up with unique sounds for each piece. Ellington's understanding of how each player sounded individually and how they fit together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary mentions Creole Love Call as an example of Ellington using the human voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This showcases his early use of voice to add texture and color without words getting in the way. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a talent he continued to show throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece is full of interesting textures. Here's what it's got:\nChorus 1: A call-and-response between voice and reeds, where the voice starts smooth and melodic, then gets rougher at the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds on the basic melody and emphasizes some extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, with a subtle syncopated piano phrase backing it up.\nChorus 4: The full band repeats the first chorus with a call-and-response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds start the call-and-response in a high register, backed by stop-time syncopation from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument.\nTag: A short tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color is just one of his many stylistic traits that are all over his work. In Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) takes this idea even further, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There's this nagging feeling that she's had for a long time. It started when she was 14 and entered the teenage scene. It's been around for three years now, and she's convinced it's something more than just a thing - it's a person. But, weirdly, none of the guys she's met have caught her attention. Some have tried to impress her, but it's like they were speaking a different language. She's constantly questioning this strange desire, trying to figure out what's behind it. Her thoughts have come up with some theories, but nothing that really makes sense. So, she's just going with the flow, wondering what's going on with her.\n\nAt home, things are usually chill. Her parents are super laid-back and rarely argue with each other. They almost never argue with her either, except when she gets all independent and free-spirited. That's just her way of being, and they respect it. But today wasn't a chill day. As she wandered from room to room looking for some inspiration, she heard her mom let out a loud shriek from the kitchen. She rushed in, freaking out, and asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mom lying on the ground, gritting her teeth and saying \"Ow\" between short breaths. Her daughter sprang into action, trying to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mom was in a lot of pain, so she quickly asked, \"Okay, Mom, where can I pick you up?\" Her mom gave her directions, and she was grateful she'd taken those self-defense classes - she was able to lift her mom and get her into the car.\n\nThe hospital had that weird mix of antiseptic and sickness smells, but she was too worried about her mom to notice. She rushed in and started calling for help, and soon a bunch of worried faces were around her mom, looking her over. They quickly wheeled her mom in, and she was left sitting there, worried sick. It turned out her mom had slipped off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to establish a link between following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. To achieve this, a modified version of the Med diet, named \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet, was used in the study. The aMed diet is characterized by a diet high in plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but low in animal products and saturated fats. A moderate amount of alcohol was allowed. \n\nPast studies already showed that sticking to a Med diet is linked to lower risk of total and heart-related (CVD) mortality, and a trial proved that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in helping people lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, previous research did not focus on the relationship between the Med diet and stroke.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term research project involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six occasions between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on the participants' self-reported diets, which they had detailed in food frequency questionnaires. More than 95% of the nurses remained involved in the study for the entire 20-year period. The accuracy of the reported diets was verified through separate studies. When medical records or death certificates weren't available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included in the research, which made up about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks.\n\nEssential data like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were also documented for each food frequency questionnaire. Starting in 1986, the participants' leisure-time physical activity was also recorded. To reduce individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated the average aMed score over two years by combining scores from the previous two questionnaires. The study controlled for factors that could influence the results by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical model, the researchers analyzed the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke. The results showed that women who followed the Med diet closely, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, were at a lower risk of developing heart disease and stroke. Over the course of 20 years, the researchers found 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of developing both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "Back in 2007, the United States was hit with a huge financial disaster. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market went down the drain, and many of America's biggest companies were left in shambles. This recession has stuck around, so we have to ask: what caused this mess, and how can we fix it? To get to the bottom of it, let's just say it all started with some super selfish and clueless politicians who made some pretty reckless decisions that tricked banks and companies into giving out bad loans. These loans went to people who couldn't afford them, and the financial system wasn't ready to handle it. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to back these mortgages and package them up into some complicated securities. When people started defaulting on these loans, the banks were in a tight spot and passed the buck to the people who had bought the repackaged mortgages. It was like a big domino effect, and the whole economy got knocked down.\n\nThe roots of this mess go way back to the Clinton days, when President Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he relaxed the rules on lending, which set the stage for the sub-prime crisis years later. Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote in 1999 that Fannie Mae was getting in big trouble because it was being forced to give out loans to people who couldn't afford them. Holmes even predicted that this would lead to a huge problem: \"The government-backed company might tank in a recession, leading to a huge bailout like the one in the 1980s.\" And guess what? He was right! As we all know, bad lending can lead to a total economic meltdown.\n\nA bunch of factors combined to make things worse, like these crazy new mortgage deals. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were all the rage back then, and they just made things more complicated. This led to people and companies getting way too invested in the housing market, making them super vulnerable to even small changes in prices. And then, BAM! The housing bubble burst, and all the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities got burned. The top five US investment banks were stuck with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which was like 30% of the country's entire GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers went down, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks with super strict rules. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in debt and got taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Okay, let's talk about exposition.  You know, that part in a story where you take a deep breath and try to wow your readers with your writing, but sometimes they just end up falling asleep or hitting the \"Back\" button in frustration.  Dr. Merlin has been there too, yelling at her monitor when she gets stuck in Too Much Information land.\n\nExposition is basically a writing nemesis that tempts you to tell instead of show.  You already know the basic rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's still easy to get sucked into boring passages that don't move the story forward.  Exposition is like that pesky voice in your head that says, \"Just get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the exciting parts.\"\n\nSo, what is exposition exactly?  It's when you tell your readers what happened, usually in a straightforward way.  In movies, it's like when one character spouts off a bunch of info to another - like a \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" marathon.  As a writer, you're the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's look at an example.  Imagine you're reading a story and suddenly you're hit with a few paragraphs of info about the heroine's love life: she met her husband, they got married in a big ceremony, and he got murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect that whole sequence to take up two pages, with both characters only getting two lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to flesh out the husband's character through his words and actions, so you can see how much he loves his wife.  You'd also want to get a glimpse of how her life changed with him and how she felt about him.  That way, when the author tells you they had an amazing connection, you'll believe it and care about what happens to them.\n\nIn short, you want to add some meat to the bare bones of the story.  Instead of just saying \"They met, they married, he died,\" you want to make it feel real.  It's tempting to rush through the details, but trust us, it's worth taking the time to make it count.  For example, let's say you're introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station, was married twice, and has all these other traits.  Don't give your readers a laundry list - show them through his actions and dialogue instead.  It's easier to get caught up in the story that way.",
            "Today I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio - an NBC 4 live report this morning (August 13, 2011) and a few other stories. The first one I saw was about a dude named Shad Hostettler who knifed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They showed his mugshot and, let's just say, he looked like the baddest of the bad. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still developing. I think they got it right, though. \n\tThe next story was about some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers getting shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was in critical condition, and the SWAT Team was on the case, but no arrests had been made yet. This story felt kinda short, and I'm wondering if it's because the victim was black. I've noticed that when minorities get hurt or get murdered, it's like they fade into the background. If a white kid or adult gets kidnapped or gets hurt, the news goes crazy, but when it's a minority person, they're lucky if they even get a mention. \n\tThey also did a piece on the gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter. They said the bullet was probably from a .22 caliber rifle, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that'll lead to the shooter. \n\tAfter that, they did a tease for some thunderstorms and rain on Saturday afternoon, saying the temps would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. They kept it short so we'd stay tuned. \n\tThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said the robber was a dark-skinned black guy wearing a hoodie and a sweatshirt. They went on and on about how dark he was, which seemed kinda weird. \n\tAnother story was about some dude named Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who'd been caught selling a lot of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my eye was when they said he got sentenced to 300 months in prison instead of 25 years. I'm not sure what the point was there - maybe they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but that didn't seem super relevant to the story.",
            "There's a special connection between brothers that's unbreakable and unshakeable - a bond that's filled with a mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and sometimes even cruelty. Brothers have a way of understanding each other that's deeper than any other kind of connection, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. It's when things get really tough that the true nature of this bond really comes out - whether it's good or bad. When these emotions are clear, they come with a big price tag. Part of understanding the emotions that come with being a brother is dealing with the consequences that come with them. When you can look a brother in the eye and see your own reflection staring back at you, you see yourself for who you really are, not how others see you. It's in your actions and the consequences of those actions that you really find out what you're made of. In the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this theme and all the crazy emotions that come with it. They set out on this wild journey through a vivid and beautiful landscape, but it's all for nothing in the end. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the most intense moment, and only one brother makes it out alive. The theme is shown through how the characters act and talk to each other, and also through the narrator's point of view, which helps us see how the protagonist feels and sees the world around him. \n\nThe whole story is all about one main emotion: the protagonist's pride. From the very beginning, he's super resentful of his little brother, Doodle, who was born with a weak heart and can't do all the cool things the protagonist wants to teach him. He wanted a brother who could be his partner in adventure, but Doodle's condition makes that impossible. The protagonist even thought about killing Doodle at one point, which is just crazy, but when Doodle smiles at him, it makes him realize he actually loves his little brother deep down. It's like his heart was beating with love all along, even if he didn't want to admit it. The story shows how the protagonist's love and anger towards Doodle are always at war, and in the end, it's a battle he can't win.",
            "My brain is like, super complicated and creative, you know? It's like it's got its own way of processing information. Over time, how we've described it has changed with the advancements in tech. Initially, it was like a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and now it's compared to a computer. However, keep in mind that these comparisons aren't that accurate and might lead to some pretty big misunderstandings. \n\nWhen I'm learning about my brain, I'm picking up that it gets info from my senses first. It takes the physical things like touch, heat, sound waves, or light and turns them into these electrochemical signals. The brain breaks down this info in two ways – bottom-up and top-down processing. When I look at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together simple stuff like color, orientation, and where the box starts and ends. Then top-down processing kicks in and uses that info to help me figure out what the box is, like a box and not a hole in the background. \n\nAfter that, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which brain processes I should let it in. For instance, when I look down at my shoes, my brain processes every blade of grass, but the attention filter keeps me from actually seeing them. But if I'm trying to hear my name in a crowded room, that filter lets the sound through. There are lots of stages of processing, and my brain goes back and forth with the attention filter a bunch of times.\n\nIn order for my brain to process info, it's gotta store it first. There are different types of memory – sensory, working, and long-term. First, it's gotta be encoded, and there are different ways to do that depending on the type of sensory info. For example, if someone's talking, my brain can encode it based on what it looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means. Once it's stored, my brain's gotta keep it. Animal studies have shown that working memory, which is like, temporary, is kept by an electrical signal looping through some neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are lots of different models explaining how the brain organizes knowledge, and they're all based on different things – like how people remember stuff or how computers work or how the brain is wired. One of these models is the semantic network, which says that there are these nodes representing concepts, and they're connected based on how related they are. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World paints a picture of a dystopian future where technology and a capitalistic society reinforce each other. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a larger game, trapped in a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. By examining the novel through a Marxist lens, it becomes clear that Huxley has some major issues with these emerging systems. Terms like homogeny and reification are scattered throughout the book, hinting at his concerns about the economy of his time. \n\nHuxley uses satire to poke fun at capitalism by highlighting the concept of false consciousness. This basically means that regular folks don't really know their place in the economic hierarchy; they're too busy looking out for themselves. This is essentially the result of ideological control over the working class, something that's super obvious in Brave New World. The lower classes are basically mindless drones, conditioned through hypnopædia to desire, consume, and indulge above all else. The World Controller is behind it all, manipulating the masses like pawns on a chessboard. The idea of hegemony – where one group dominates another – is totally at play here. The lower classes are oblivious to the manipulation, blindly following the ideology that keeps them in line. The upper classes, on the other hand, are aware of it, but they just accept their place in society. Only a few characters, like Bernard, seem to care about the bigger picture. The way the social classes interact with each other is a huge indication of the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are basically non-existent. The novel seems to strip away any depth or emotion from its characters, even the main ones. Huxley might be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together is stripping people of their free will and individuality. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions that are purely physical or superficial. The way characters talk about each other, focusing on appearance rather than substance, is a big clue. The fact that each social class is content with their place in the hierarchy is a clear indication of how capitalism affects people's perceptions of themselves and their place in society.",
            "So, I've been at University Park for two and a half years. It's basically four and a half semesters for those who are counting. Getting around campus can be a real pain in the butt. Last year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is basically the last stop on campus, except for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. I'd have to trudge from my place in Stuart Hall all the way to the Willard building near the middle of campus, which would take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially if the weather's lousy. I talked to an old alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were cut off from the rest of school by a huge empty space. Nowadays, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus keeps expanding, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? For a college campus, it's gotta be bikes. But it's not just about having a bike; people need to ride them, and the campus needs to be bike-friendly.\n\nI was chatting with a friend who recently got back into biking after taking a few years off, and he was saying how he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for you, but it's also super efficient. You can pack a bowl of oatmeal and get 30 miles or more out of it – not bad for a little exercise. I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I did this year was buy a bike. Now, every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with a bike, I can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. I've got to give credit to walking, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up a ton of my time – over two and a half hours every week. That's time I just can't afford to waste."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My dream is to pursue a career with the Division of Family and Children Services where I can help young ones who've been through a rough patch and troubled families in need. My values of service, respect, and a strong moral compass are what I believe will make me a valuable addition to the social work field. These aren't just buzzwords to me - they're genuinely important values that I strive for both personally and professionally. My goal is to help people, but I wasn't always sure how I could do this. In high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and some turning to less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. Seeing this, I decided to study Psychology, still unsure what I wanted to do with my degree. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, but a summer visit to a friend's house changed everything. There was this sixteen-year-old kid on her couch, visibly nervous, and she told me why he was visiting: his parents were abusing him. The next day, I learned he'd called the cops. I visited his parents' place, explained my concerns to the police, and told them about my Psychology degree. They asked me to talk to the parents since the law couldn't intervene, so I did. The parents seemed really uptight and made excuses for their son's behavior, saying he was manipulative for involving outsiders. That experience made me realize how much I wanted to help kids with family problems like that.\n\nAnother value that's super important to me in social work is social justice. We claim society values individuality, but it seems like we actually prioritize fitting in with the norm. If we mourn the loss of individuals, why do we try to be like everyone else? I'm all about being true to myself and not putting limits on who I am. In school, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could: I dyed my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that expressed my personality, got piercings that made me happy, joined the GSBA, and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I'll keep fighting for social justice because it's a part of who I am.",
            "This paper looks at how the biological and sociocultural models relate to the disorder insomnia. The biological model is all about the genetic code we inherit from our family and how medical stuff affects our health. The sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines how things around us like racism, ethnicity, demographics, and our financial situation can influence our sleep problems. This review explores these two models by explaining each research study that's relevant to them, trying to understand how they're connected. Then, I'll critique each study to point out what they do well and what they don't.\n\nInsomnia can be broken down into three main categories: it's either a sleep disorder itself, connected to another mental health issue, or caused by something else like a medical condition or a substance. Primary sleep disorders are either Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, which are basically the two groups of sleep disorders. Dyssonmias, which are linked to starting and staying asleep, include things like Primary Insomnia, where you can't sleep properly, and Primary Hypersomnia, where you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy involves weird episodes of automatic behavior during REM sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias are sleep disorders that involve weird behaviors or physical things happening during sleep, like Nightmares, Sleep Terrors, or Sleepwalking. I'm focusing on insomnia and some Primary sleep disorders in this review, especially in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model looks at how our genes, what we inherit, and our body's physical stuff affect our sleep. It's like, our brain has special cells called neurons in the hypothalamus that control our sleep and wakefulness. One study used mice and found that these neurons have special receptors that help us sleep and wake up. If these receptors get messed up, it can cause problems with sleep. The study showed that a special medicine that interacts with these receptors can actually help us sleep better. This study is cool because it shows that our genes and environment can affect our sleep. If we inherited something that affects our sleep receptors, it could mess with our ability to sleep properly, which is a big deal because it can impact our daily life, like school, work, and even doing boring tasks.",
            "So, let's dive into the three main areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First off, we're going to define what CAPD is all about. Then we'll get into the diagnosis part, including all the telltale signs or \"red flags\" that a teacher should look out for. Finally, we'll wrap things up by talking about how a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom can help out a student with CAPD.\n\nSo, CAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is basically how well your brain handles what you hear. It's a disorder where the central nervous system (CNS), aka your brain, can't process the sounds it receives properly. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain isn't doing its job to separate words or tell the difference between background noise and actual conversation.\n\nThe first recorded mention of what would eventually become CAPD was back in the 1950s when researchers came across a condition called \"auditory imperception\" when trying to figure out why some kids were having trouble with communication. It wasn't until 1954 that an Italian research team started working on tests for these kids, and by 1961, a Japanese researcher named Kimura came up with a model that explained how the brain works when we hear two sounds at the same time.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of ways: someone with it might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from or hearing them in space, or they might struggle to tell two or more sounds apart. They might also have a hard time recognizing patterns in sounds, or telling when someone is being sarcastic based on how they say something. It can also be tough for people with CAPD to put together all the sound clues they hear and make sense of them, or to figure out the order in which sounds are happening. And, yeah, it can even be hard for them to tell when one sound is blocking out another.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, you need to do a bunch of tests that check how well someone's brain is processing sounds. These tests are usually done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists, and they might involve questionnaires, observing how someone reacts to different sounds, or even recording what's going on inside their ear and measuring how they respond to it. There's no one test that works really well for figuring out CAPD, and we still don't know what causes it. But these tests can give us an idea of what's going on.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that using a disguise to fool people for a long time can actually trap you if you don't shed that fake identity. The thing is, when you finally stop pretending, it can lead to some real problems. You might find yourself all alone because the people around you got hurt by your deception. It's a tough decision: do you save yourself, or the people who got caught up in your trick? Some people might be pretty chill about it, but others will be super mad. The more complicated thing is when the disguise is about switching genders. It's like, why do people feel the need to pretend to be someone else? In the case of Viola, she's just trying to protect herself by pretending to be a guy. She does it to avoid getting hurt, like \"I'll take you to a captain who helped me hide my feminine side so I could work for this noble count.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.247-249)\n\nSo Viola comes up with a plan and pretends to be a dude, which actually works, but it also makes her miss out on the support of the women around her. To make things worse, Olivia thinks she's actually talking to a guy named Sebastian, not a girl, and falls for it. Plus, Viola's also got some unrequited feelings for Orsino, but she's got to hide it because she's pretending to be a guy, like \"boy, you've told me a million times you don't like women like me.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.260-261)\n\nIt's a bit weird to look at it from today's perspective, but Twelfth Night might be saying that deception can actually help people figure out their real feelings. Maybe Olivia and Orsino have secret desires that Viola/Cesario makes them confront. For example, is Olivia really into Cesario because he's a guy, or is she secretly into girls? I think it's probably not the case, because Olivia's character is probably just making fun of people who judge others based on looks. We can tell because she quickly goes from liking Cesario to loving Sebastian, and starts treating Viola like a sister instead of a love interest, like \"you're her, a sister.\" (Twelfth Night, 5.1.315)",
            "People have been talking about how brutal the German colonial rule was, especially the way they dealt with the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. But it's not as simple as saying that's all the German colonies were like. They were all pretty different places with different policies and ruling styles. Even their educational systems varied, and it's not like they all followed the same rules. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that there were a bunch of educated and literate Africans living there. The German's efforts to educate people in Kamerun and other colonies even got some good reviews from writers back then.\n\nBut then you have South West Africa (now Namibia), which was a totally different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government built schools and tried to help the locals get an education, the task of teaching the natives in South West Africa was basically left to some missionary groups with not a lot of government support. The government did put a lot of resources towards teaching Europeans in the colony, though, and they set up schools and regulated the missionary schools even more. These choices had a big impact on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies had a bunch of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa the majority of the population remained pretty much untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. It's been argued that this was partly because of a bunch of different social, political, and economic factors.\n\nA lot of people have written about education in the German colonies, but most of their stuff is in German and was written a long time ago. Some of the earlier stuff just described the educational systems in the different colonies, while later writers did more in-depth studies and compared the systems between colonies. One of the most important studies is Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa. He found that the main reason for the differences between the two colonies is because of the number of settlers living in South West Africa. Compared to the other German colonies, South West Africa had a pretty nice climate, but a lot of it is desert. The number of European settlers in South West Africa was pretty high, too - by 1913, there were around 15,000 of them, while there were only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next biggest settler population.",
            "The way we understand and categorize Popular Music has changed a lot over the past 100 years, with the field growing so complex that it's hard to keep track of all the different genres. To make matters even more confusing, many of the major genres, like rock, country, and jazz, have spawned countless sub-genres, making it tough to pin them down. One of the most exciting and expressive genres to have emerged in the past 40 years is Heavy Metal rock, which has become incredibly diverse and adaptable. Heavy Metal music has a knack for expressing a wide range of emotions, mostly leaning towards the darker and more intense end of the spectrum. \n\nAs the genre began to take shape, people quickly realized its potential for flexibility and started experimenting with different styles, which led to the creation of sub-genres, and eventually, sub-sub-genres. Today, the heavy metal scene is so vast that it's difficult to define what exactly heavy metal is. It has managed to incorporate elements from other genres, but like everything, it has its roots somewhere. To truly understand the diverse metal music out there, you need to grasp the core of the metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is, in many ways, a movement that's deeply connected to the darker side of human experience. It's often described as a \"more is more\" philosophy, where music is amplified to be louder, more intense, and more theatrical. Metal musicians are known for their incredible technical skills, which is evident in their music. Moreover, the heavy metal scene has a long history of being influenced by psychedelic substances, which, in the 1970s, led to the creation of wild, otherworldly sounds. Many metal bands have tapped into the dark, visceral qualities that characterized the Romantic Era, adding to the genre's mystique. The lyrics of songs like the ones by the Beatles, in their song Helter Skelter, showcase the darker side of the music, which has become a staple of the movement.",
            "I'm totally immersed in the world of Henri Rousseau's art, but it's not just his paintings that I'm obsessed with - it's the story behind them too. Like, a few decades before the Surrealist artists started painting their trippy works, Rousseau was already churning out his own dreamlike masterpieces. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is all about a chick who's stoked about the wonders she sees in a far-off land, but it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as an artist. See, he always wanted to get recognized and loved by his fellow artists and art lovers, but that came with a major internal conflict - should he follow the rules and paint like everyone else, or be a rebel and do his own thing?\n\nTo fully get what's going on with The Dream, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life story. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a French town called Laval. His dad was a rich hardware dealer, and growing up, Rousseau didn't have any fancy art training. Instead, he worked a regular job for France as a toll collector until he was forty. Yeah, he had a pretty cool nickname - douanier, or customs inspector, even though that's not what he really did. Tragedy struck when his first wife, Clémence, died, along with eight of their babies. He was left with just one kid, Julia, and a ton of sadness. Painting became his escape and new beginning. Unlike all the other artists of his time who were painting idealized country folk, Rousseau was a folk painter through and through, with hopes and dreams just like the average dude.\n\nRousseau's desperation to be accepted by the art world makes sense when you consider that he was basically a newbie, started late, and was competing with all these other talented artists who were already making a name for themselves. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was getting famous that Rousseau started getting recognition too. According to art expert Jan Gordon, they were like total opposites - Matisse was afraid of painting stuff that was cliché, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would finally take him seriously as a real artist.",
            "A lot of smart people have argued that there's a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, or truth and beauty. I think it's because there's a reason at the core of this. John Keats said in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" that \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn most things in life from school or experience, but it seems like we get into ethics and aesthetics without being taught that way. Both ethics and aesthetics are more like describing things than telling people what to do. Our studies of morality and beauty are really just trying to figure out why something is beautiful or moral, rather than making rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nGet to the point, talking about art or morals can never fully capture what's good or beautiful. For example, a discussion about the Mona Lisa might talk about stuff like the background and foreground, but it won't explain why it's good art. When people talk about their favorite work of art or literature, they usually say something like \"There's just something about it\" before trying to explain it. I think both art and morals can never be fully put into words. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how much we describe a work of art, there's something left over that can't be explained. I think ethics has the same property. Wittgenstein said that ethics can't be expressed, it's transcendental.\n\nI think morality and art are connected because we experience them in the same way, at a deep level that can't be fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean says, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. Maybe moral standards don't apply to other art forms like music, but they seem to be just as relevant to literature as they are to real life. Living involves values, and literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's got its own unique vibe going on, blending cultures from the foothills of the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. It's like this cool mix of cultures that flows from Köln along the Rhine River, all the way to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. With such a rich cultural history, it's no surprise that Germany's got its roots in various tribes and sources. \n\nGermania's basically the ancestral homeland of the Germans, but the origins of its name are super disputed among scholars. Some think it comes from the Germanic Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. The Roman historian Tacitus said that, and he even wrote a book about it back in 98 AD. Julius Caesar, on the other hand, used the word 'Germanus' in his commentary on the Gallic Wars to describe the Germanic tribes he fought against. He got the word from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the people he'd already conquered and those he hadn't. In one of his books, Julius Caesar writes about how the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly waging war with the Gauls. Others believe the name 'Germanus' comes from the spear they used in battle, called a ger, or maybe from the Old Irish word garim, which means 'to shout', implying that the Germans were super loud or rowdy.\n\nTacitus wrote in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' that the Germans were a pretty distinct bunch, not really mixed with other cultures. He thought it was crazy that anyone would leave their homes in Asia or Africa to move to Germany, with its wild landscapes, harsh weather, and grumpy vibe. The Romans would send their soldiers to trade and conquer Germania, but they mostly stuck to their own empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the border of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood staring, my mind was a complete blank slate, taking in everything in front of me without really processing it.  I was just kinda zoning out to the whole scene.  It was like my thoughts were racing by so fast I couldn't even catch up to them.  It was like I was just observing everything without really thinking about it.  I mean, my brain was totally engaged, but not really connected to anything. \n\nI had this art book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\", that I'd bought based on some advice from an artist I was working with.  I've been wanting to learn how to draw forever - since I was six - and this book was the key.  It teaches you all the basics, from what a pencil is to how our brains interpret lines.  One trick it shows you is to draw a square frame around the thing you're looking at to make it easier to understand.  So, like, if you're staring at a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, you just imagine a simple plane and that's it.  I'd heard about that technique, but when I tried it, I just couldn't wrap my head around it.  The picture was too overwhelming, so I just stood there and stared in awe.  I was trying to tap into some level of artistic vision, like Picasso's blue phase or Monet's love of greenery.  I was feeling pretty pretentious, like I was on the verge of creating something amazing.  I'd call it \"Work in Brown\".\n\nI started to pick up my pencil, my hand moving towards the paper with a plan.  I was ready to unleash my creativity.  But then my hand just sort of jerked back, like I'd lost my train of thought.  I tried again, but my hand just slapped the toilet handle.  I was trying to work, but my hand was just kinda spasming out.  I was staring at some gross brown stuff in the toilet, and I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  I picked up the mop, hesitated for a second, and then just stood there, staring.  My tie was all bunched up around my neck, and I was starting to feel pretty annoyed.  I mean, who leaves this stuff in the bathroom?  I thought about just giving up and walking away, but then I picked up the toilet paper roll and started mummifying my hand with it.  It was like I was in a daze, just going through the motions.  Finally, I dipped my hand into the toilet bowl, like I was some kind of crazy person.  I guess I just wasn't feeling it that day.",
            "The scary truth is that teenagers are dying behind the wheel at an alarming rate. A bunch of things combine to make driving a deadly trap for new drivers. The National Institutes of Health say that one big part of the problem is that the teen brain just isn't ready to handle driving. They're also super inexperienced, which doesn't just cause more fatal accidents, but also makes them way more likely to get into rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt's no surprise that teens do way worse when they're driving with their friends. I mean, who doesn't know that they're always together in the car? A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center showed a pretty cool correlation: the older the passenger, the fewer the car accidents. Some states like California have tried to make it safer for teen drivers by introducing temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and stop them from driving with their friends.\n\nBut let's be real, these temporary licenses are just a temporary fix. The real issue is that younger drivers, as a group, just aren't ready for the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He's done research that shows people under 19-20 are super into taking risks just for the thrill of it. That makes sense, so it's probably a good idea to delay getting a driver's license until that need for a rush starts to fade. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing more and more fatal accidents, and the death toll is probably going to be huge in the next few years. By 2010, all the kids born during the Baby Boom will be old enough to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nMaking new laws about this would be pretty straightforward. Schools could still teach driver's ed, but no one under 18 could drive. A provisional permit could still be issued, but only after a certain number of practice hours with an adult. The number of hours could be the same as most states require (in California, it's 6 hours of driving with an adult and 50 hours of practice). Because the problem is everywhere, making national laws would be a good way to protect teens all over the country. It's not a new idea, but it's one that could make a big difference.",
            "I spent the day going through the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films. I was really into the trick films that they had, there were 15 of them from '95 to '01. They mostly use editing to make it seem like magic. I watched them all and took notes on how they work. Most of the trick films are pretty straightforward and predictable, but a few of the later ones had some really cool stuff that didn't follow the rules. The trick films from way back when are all pretty simple - they're shot from one angle, don't move the camera, and stick to long and medium shots. But a few of the early 20th century films were like rebels and didn't follow these rules. They started doing things like using multiple shots.\n\nOne weird thing that all the trick films have in common is that they're all shot in a little box on stage. The camera doesn't move, it just stays in one place the whole time. This is really obvious in most of the old films, and it's something that they got from the theatre and magic shows. The problem with using a stage is that the people in the film can only move side to side, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in that old film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\", the actors come in from the side and just move back and forth. Even when they go out of the frame, the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nAll the trick films I watched were shot from really far away - a long shot, basically - and sometimes a medium shot. They never used close-up shots at all. This is because of the way that theatre and magic shows work - the whole performance is set up on a stage and the audience sees the whole thing at once. In most old films, the actors just stood in the middle of the screen and didn't move towards the camera, so there were no close-ups.\n\nMost of the trick films from back then were really short, like a minute or less. This is because they were just one big shot in the viewer's eyes, but actually consisted of several different shots all stuck together to make the illusion work. For example, in that old film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\", if you look closely, you can see where the shot with the fake head starts, even though the whole film is just one shot to the viewer. The trick films are mostly just short little magic tricks, but they're still really cool to watch.",
            "So, you wanna know about John Taylor of Caroline?  He was a total believer in that whole Republican thing, even though he was more of a farmer than anything else (he even dabbled in politics for a bit).  He was super dedicated to his causes, especially when it came to personal freedom and government.  His love for the simple life was basically the basis for all of his opinions on, like, pretty much everything.  He thought that farming was the key to making the government work right, and that's why he was always going on about how it should be the best career out there.\n\nTaylor thought that the US had a chance to create this awesome system of government because they didn't have any old traditions to mess things up.  He believed in the natural rights of people, and that they're all connected - if one is taken away, the others lose value too.  He thought the government should stay out of it and not mess with those rights.  He had this weird idea that in the \"state of nature,\" the strong and mean people were the ones who got ahead, but that's not how it should be in a civilized society.\n\nTo create this perfect society, Taylor thought the government should be all about acknowledging the good and bad in people.  He was super strict about his ideas on right and wrong, and he said that because government is run by people, it's gotta be human too.  He said that good principles are about protecting private property, helping out farmers, and keeping capitalism in check, and that a government based on those principles would work just fine no matter who's in charge.  But, he thought self-interest was a major problem, and that it's only bad when it's used to hurt others.\n\nTaylor was all about keeping the government small and limited, just like the Constitution says.  He didn't want the feds to have any more power than they absolutely needed, 'cause he knew that would just make 'em expensive and, like, super controlling.  But at the same time, he thought that just following the Constitution literally without thinking about what the people who wrote it meant could be a bad idea.  He also thought the Declaration of Independence was way more important than the Constitution, 'cause it talks about the US being a bunch of separate states rather than just one big nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, we noticed that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. That was pretty disappointing, and it's hard to figure out why that happened. You'd think that with winter coming to a New England campus, people would be less likely to commute by bike or on foot, which could explain part of the drop. Also, December's a crazy time with everyone wrapping up schoolwork and grades, which might make people forget all about filling out that commuter log. On top of that, December's the start of the holiday season, and everyone's busy getting ready for a long break from campus. When classes start up again in late January, it makes sense that log submissions would be low that month too. But none of that really explains why submissions were so low in February. Maybe projects like this one just naturally lose steam after the initial excitement wears off. So, we came up with the Carpool Challenge Week in March to try and get people excited again, and it worked - we saw an increase in log submissions that month. One of the biggest challenges we faced was keeping the project going when people naturally lose interest, and dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that are a part of higher education. \n\nAnother problem we encountered with this project (and probably any similar one) is that people love the freedom and independence that comes with driving their cars. That's just part of our culture, so we needed to offer incentives to get people to switch to alternative modes of transportation. We gave out a bunch of gift cards to local places, but it would've been cool to see how bigger prizes like a bike, a hybrid car, or an electric car might've boosted participation. That could've helped us avoid that dip in engagement we saw. We kept the same prizes throughout the project, which might not have been the best idea. If we'd announced bigger and better prizes as the project went on - like adding a bike in December and a car in January - I bet people would've been way more into it.",
            "So, you're probably wondering what an ETF is. Well, it's like a hybrid between an index fund and a stock – it tracks an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets, but trades like a single stock on the exchange. It gives you the benefits of owning a bunch of different things (like an index fund) and the flexibility to sell short, buy on margin, and even buy just one share, just like with a stock. And the best part? The fees for ETFs are way lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides – you gotta pay a commission for each trade, just like with stocks. Plus, there are a ton of different ETFs to choose from, which is awesome, but also kinda overwhelming. When picking an ETF, it's smart to really think about whether the benefits, like diversification, are actually working for you, and to what extent.\n\nWe're gonna take a closer look at the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, which account for about 63.6% of its assets. It'd be a real pain to go over all the holdings, so we're just gonna focus on the top 10. Here are the top 10 holdings and their share of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo figure out how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we're gonna use their current percentages to calculate their contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, like if the portfolio was made up of just these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. We got the Beta and Return calculations below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's pretty clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a higher return (6.11% higher) and lower Beta (0.12 lower) than the ETF. But here's the thing – it's possible that these two portfolios aren't actually that different from each other.\n\nTo check if they are actually different, we're gonna calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compare it to the ETF's standard deviation.",
            "I was reading about Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" and I'm convinced it's one of his best works. In the poem, Poe mentions the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a term that he apparently picked up from Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island off the northern coast of Britain that the ancient Greeks thought was the edge of the known world, but people think Poe got it from someone else too. Poe was really into German writers like Goethe, and it shows. \n\nThis connection is a big deal because it proves how well-read Poe was. Karl J. Arndt, a writer who studied Poe and Goethe, noticed that their poems were similar and even thought Poe was copying Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature has a whole section on Goethe, who was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. There's a poem within Faust called \"The King of Thule\" that's pretty dark and talks about a king who loses his wife and then drowns his sorrows in booze. The king's story is kind of like the main character in \"Dream-Land\", maybe even a dark mirror image of Poe's own struggles with drinking. Goethe's Faust was even turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in another poem.\n\nPoe mentioned Thule twice in his writings, first in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and then again in \"Dream-Land\" as the start and end of the poem. It's like \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are two poems that go together. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes a place called Thule that's dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends. It's like he's stepping into Goethe's world. Goethe was a big deal in Poe's time, and Poe even admired Alfred Tennyson, who was friends with Goethe. Poe probably knew about Goethe's work through all the reproductions of his work that were happening after it was first published.",
            "If a customer was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store under California law, could they get punitive damages if the store manager, Paul Martin, was acting with malice because he was told twice about the spill but didn't clean it up for half an hour because he was eating dinner?  I don't think a judge would just dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages without a fight. To get punitive damages, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, would need to show that the store manager acted on purpose with a bad intention to cause harm, or that he acted really badly and didn't care about the consequences. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known that not cleaning the spill would be a problem because there were already a bunch of people slipping and falling in the store before her accident, and he still didn't do anything about it. Palmer might have a point, but it's not super strong because there were only six slip-and-fall incidents that year and Martin still didn't do enough to keep the store safe.\n\nIt looks like Martin was pretty clueless because on October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told him about the applesauce spill, and Martin basically said he was too busy eating dinner to deal with customer complaints. Then, at 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also told him about the spill, and he said the same thing. It wasn't until 30 minutes later, at 5:30 pm, that Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back. Before Palmer's accident, there had already been five slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 at the store. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we're wondering if we should file a motion to get rid of the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, if someone gets hurt because the other person didn't do what they were supposed to do (like keep the store safe), they can get punitive damages if the other person acted really badly and didn't care about the consequences. The law says that's malice if the person knew what they were doing was going to hurt someone, or if they were really reckless and didn't care about the consequences. It's like when someone knows that what they're doing is going to hurt someone, but they do it anyway. That's not cool.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took an Islam course at CBC, where discussions often revolved around whether Islam is a hostile religion.  In my opinion, this question is more relevant now than ever.  Observing the mass media's shift from a hostile view of Islam to over-the-top tolerance since 9/11 has been pretty mind-blowing.  Back in 2001, it was unthinkable to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, who has family ties to Islam, running for office.\n\nThe story of the Prophet's life really fascinates me.  I've learned that it's almost like a biography of a hero, but it contradicts what I thought I knew about Muhammad.  According to history, I thought Muhammad forced people to convert to Islam by conquering tribes and imposing his faith on them, but the biography portrays him as a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  People were drawn to his teachings because of some kind of inner light or something, not because they were coerced.\n\nIt's also weird how the stories of Muhammad's life have some parallels to the story of Jesus – like the time he fed a bunch of people with a small amount of food and had some left over.  I get the feeling that the writers wanted to make Muhammad out to be this super humble guy who didn't need to prove anything, but just lived life with integrity and performed miracles because that's who he was.  It's like they're watering down the real miracle of Jesus and trying to ride his coattails.\n\nI've also noticed that the biography includes a lot of stories that seem to be about providing proof that people converted to Islam on their own free will.  But the problem is that these stories are often based on second-hand accounts and seem suspicious because of that.  It's like they're trying to build a case for the validity of the stories, but it actually makes them seem less believable.\n\nWhat really gets me is that they're trying to paint Muhammad as this super nice and wise guy who's above reproach.  But history says that's not true, and I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It's like the original message of Jesus got lost in the shuffle as Christianity evolved after he was gone.  If we look at the big picture, it seems like Christianity has been moving further and further away from its roots.  I think we're starting to see a shift, though.  There are more people who care about the real story of Jesus and the ideas he stood for.  While some folks might stick with tradition, I think they'll be outnumbered.  Christians are becoming more aware of their history, and this awareness is going to keep growing.  It's like a longing will start to build up, to figure out what's real and what's been added to the story over the years.  It might take a long time - decades or even centuries - but eventually, Christianity will swing back to its original form.  A movement will emerge, and it will start stripping away all the extra stuff that's built up over time.  It's like the clock will start ticking backwards.  When this happens, people in the US and Europe will start to focus on what Jesus really taught, and the church will be there to guide them.  But here's the thing - because we're going back to basics, we'll see a lot less variety in what people believe.  Instead of all the different branches of Christianity, we'll see a lot more things in common.  History is full of examples of this kind of reversal.  Think about how the Roman Empire used to persecute Christians, but later became Christian itself.  Or how our country went from having African-American slaves to having African-American leaders.  A similar reversal is coming for Christianity, and it will be a journey back to the source.  To make this happen, people need to start seeing Jesus' words as metaphors, not literal rules.  So, what happened to the original message of Jesus after he was gone?\n\nLooking back, it's pretty obvious that Jesus was a part of the Jewish tradition.  When the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish people didn't all agree on the same thing.  They split into different groups - the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and just regular people.  Monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the importance of the Hebrew scriptures were all key parts of Judaism at that time.  It's interesting to think about how different the Jewish people were, and how that laid the groundwork for Christianity.",
            "I think The Jungle shows how people's true nature is deep down selfish and self-centered. All they care about is making their lives as good as possible and not really considering anyone else. The Jungle proves this in lots of ways. It's super obvious with the owners and managers of the huge factories. All they want to do is make their companies as huge and awesome as possible, no matter who gets hurt or what gets in their way. They just don't care about anything else. Upton Sinclair's writing paints a picture of the super bad stuff they're causing by making pollution, like all the smoke and gross stuff coming from the factories. He shows that the owners don't care about anyone or anything that gets hurt. They don't even care about the people working for them or the animals living near the factories. They're all about making money and don't care who they have to step on to get it.\n\nThe owners and managers were also super bad to their employees, making them work crazy hours and then just laying them off without warning or helping them find a new job. Back when The Jungle was set, there weren't any laws to protect workers, so the owners and managers could do whatever they wanted. The people working in Packingtown were basically expected to deal with the awful conditions all the time, both at work and at home. There were some unions trying to help, but they were more about making money off the workers than actually helping them. The workers were treated so badly and had no way out of the system that they were basically slaves, and Sinclair said that's just as bad as the old slave system.",
            "Many authors use different techniques to influence their readers' feelings about important topics, and some are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of using these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs words that don't normally go together to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he adds meaning to a symbol, then uses it for the same purpose. Fitzgerald uses the latter technique with lots of colors, like gold, green, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for colors, specifically white and gray, then uses that meaning to give readers a certain feeling about an important thing.\n\nFitzgerald's use of white and gray is really interesting. He gives them a meaning of uniformity, with white being fancy and high class, and gray being old and faded. He sets up this meaning right at the beginning of the novel by using them a lot. People like Daisy and Jordan are always dressed in white - almost everyone is, actually. Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine looks like she's been powdered into a milky white complexion. The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, and the halls are a gaudy mess of bright colors. Fitzgerald takes it further by using these colors on everyday, unimportant things, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down the white canyons of lower New York, and when he makes his schedule, the names of people at Gatsby's parties are just gray names.\n\nHe even uses these colors to describe plain or regular people and places: Jordan and Daisy had a white girlhood together, there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes, the kid on the train is gray, and the dog seller is an old gray guy. After Fitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray, he uses them to show that certain subjects are unimportant or uniform. He starts this with Daisy, after a long time without using these colors, he describes her as wearing white in a little white roadster, and suddenly she seems less like a person and more like just something that Gatsby wants and longs for. He uses more of this technique with Daisy to give her the impression of being a more uniform addition, like when there's a gray haze around her fur collar, or when she's wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "I recently looked into San Diego County's agricultural scene, and it's totally thriving thanks to its awesome climate. The county is producing a ton of awesome stuff, like juicy tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and spicy peppers. It's super popular for organic community supported agriculture food, with a bunch of local organizations having long waiting lists for their products, especially organic eggs and milk. Many of these farms also offer tours and activities like hiking and birdwatching, which is a win-win for landowners who can benefit from government programs and still get to enjoy the outdoors. It's like getting paid to be a nature lover!\n\nThe cool thing about organic farming is that it lets you have a super diverse ecosystem with tons of wildlife and plants, since you don't use any harsh chemicals. However, it can be a bit more labor-intensive and costly than conventional farming. You need to work harder to keep pests and weeds under control and fertilize the soil naturally, and sometimes you end up losing more crops than you would with traditional methods. Plus, a small organic farm can't compete with the efficiency of a big operation. But, there are some other practices that can help the environment and wildlife, like planting cover crops and strategic grazing rotation, which can be more expensive. That's why it might be helpful for landowners to get some financial assistance or expert advice on how to maximize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land I chose for this scenario is a 160-acre plot in Potrero, an area in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. It's located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but it covers over a hundred species of plants and animals, some of which are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the California gnatcatcher, and others that might be listed soon, like the burrowing owls. This land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s.\n\nI picked this piece of land from a real estate website and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might be able to do to cut costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I found an organic farm in the same area that I used as a model for this scenario.",
            "When it comes to negotiation, culture plays a really big role. Culture isn't just one thing; it's also about what it's not and what it means. It's not a single, uniform thing, and it's definitely not the same for everyone. Think about saying things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" - these are way too broad and don't make any sense. It's actually more helpful to understand what culture means in the context of a specific situation and how it'll affect the negotiation. When you're dealing with a different culture, you naturally compare it to your own, and that's when things get interesting.\n\nTrying to get to know a different culture or mindset can be like studying its history or realizing its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change it, you just have to accept it as it is and work within its boundaries, especially when you're negotiating and you're in a weaker position. If you're in a foreign territory, respecting their traditions and beliefs can help you get past any cultural obstacles and move the negotiation forward.\n\nNow, here's the thing: culture isn't just about countries or nationalities. Companies have their own culture too, and it can be totally different from one company to another. For instance, some companies are super strict about work hours, while others are super relaxed. You can see this in how they dress, how they communicate, and even who they hire. Some companies really encourage employees to be philanthropic, while others only let them do it through certain approved charities. Looking at how American companies differ from each other (and even within the same company, depending on the region or urban vs. suburban) shows just how diverse culture can be.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important, because they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or community harmony is a big deal, you won't publicly shame your company or boss to get ahead in negotiations. On the other hand, if a culture values getting the best deal possible, they won't settle for anything less. Knowing these generalities can help you prepare for negotiations, but it's also helpful to get to know your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "There's this crazy quote from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" It gets referenced by St. Anselm in his argument about God's existence, and our other dude, Thomas Aquinas, seems to agree with him. Since we're gonna be talking about their arguments, we'll just assume they're both on the same page about the existence of God, specifically the God from the Bible. If we're talking about some random God-type, it wouldn't be a fair comparison, so let's just roll with it. \n\nThat said, I think both of these guys make some good points, but neither really lays out a solid, all-around case for believing in God. To understand this, let's break down Anselm's argument first. Anselm's all about finding proof of God within yourself, kinda like how you can know something's true just by thinking about it. He says that because God exists in our minds, we can't even imagine a world without him. It's a pretty weird concept, but basically, he's saying that you don't need any outside evidence to believe in God – just your own thoughts. He's talking about faith, you know, when you believe in something even if there's no concrete proof. \n\nNow, Aquinas is all about using logic and facts to prove God's existence, no faith required. This would be super helpful for getting new people into Christianity, since you wouldn't have to convince them to believe in something they can't see. Aquinas breaks down five different ways to prove God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He's all about how using logic can show you that God has to exist. Think of it like trying to finish a puzzle – if you know all the other pieces, you can figure out what the missing one looks like even if you can't see it.",
            "Somewhere around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who'd later be known as Buddha was born. He'd eventually give up the world and get enlightened, and his teachings became the foundation for Buddhism—the orthodox branch of which is Theravada Buddhism. The religion is over two thousand five hundred years old, and it looks really different from what it was like when Buddha was alive. You can see this in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, where they celebrate the annual water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular people both participate, and it's got some spiritual significance, even though Buddha never taught about anything like that. These differences run all the way from surface-level traditions to the core ideas that make up the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community has changed its core principles from both the monk's perspective and the regular person's. This happened due to both external and internal forces, some good and some bad.\n\nIn this discussion, we'll use some terms a lot. When we say 'internal force,' we mean something that comes from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether someone's a monk or not. An 'external force' is any influence from outside the Buddhist world. A 'hostile force' is something that harms or tries to harm the Buddhist community, usually because of a negative view of Buddhism. A 'benign force' is any influence that doesn't want to hurt or help Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other anyway. These terms will come up a lot as we talk about this.\n\nFirst off, it's essential to understand the basics of the religion—the core ideas that make up Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists look to the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha for guidance. The Dhamma is basically made up of the Tripitaka—the three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka has the rules for monks and regular people, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka has the deeper, more philosophical ideas of Buddhism. Concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the idea that life is suffering), and Anicca (how everything's temporary) are all part of this. Recognizing these ideas can help you escape Sansara—the cycle of death and rebirth, which keeps going on and on. Along with Sansara, when you become enlightened, you'll also break free from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). In the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules laid out for how to live your life. For regular people, there are five basic rules (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't misbehave, and don't take drugs). For monks, there are many more rules to follow. The core idea of Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico had this crazy long-standing feud that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  It was like, the ultimate rivalry, and it really came to a head during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The US basically attacked Mexico, took over Texas and the Southwest, and it was a pretty intense clash.  Before the First World War, they were still having all these issues, but it finally started to die down.  This whole thing started because Americans and Mexicans had totally different ideas about stuff like religion, culture, and traditions, and they also had major disagreements over material things (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \nIt's not just the US and Mexico - lots of countries that share borders tend to have these kinds of rivalries.  The US and Mexico are actually kind of like many other countries that have been stuck in these long-term rivalries with their neighbors.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said something pretty interesting, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can you find long-lasting American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  These countries are basically right next to the US, and they've been at odds with the US for a while now.  Other countries in Latin America, on the other hand, have gotten along pretty well with the US.\n\nOne of the big issues was that the US and Mexico had totally different ideas about religion - and this has been a major problem in lots of countries throughout history.  Sally Frahm (2001) pointed out that Americans used to be super opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries (p.86).  It's kind of like how the Cold War was this huge ideological struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, except in this case, it wasn't about politics, but about whether they were Protestant or Catholic.  This whole thing started because the English and Spanish had a bunch of distrust, and the US and Mexico just inherited that.  This made it really hard for them to get along.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted up 17 different disputes between the US and Mexico during this 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes were about territory and border problems, like bandits and outlaws crossing the border.  The US and Mexico finally started to calm down when Mexico became super dependent on the US, and then they both started to focus more on economic stuff rather than expanding territory (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took a drastic turn due to a health condition that I never expected to affect me. I was a nurse at the time, and I had chosen that career path to guarantee a sense of security that I never had as a child. The constant advice I received as a kid, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" made me think that nursing was a safe bet. So, I put aside my dreams of being a scientist or journalist – a mix of both would've been awesome – and became a nurse.\n\nNow, here I am, 46 years old, single, and living on Social Security Disability after fifteen years. I've got nothing left to call my own, and every day is a struggle to stay afloat. My life feels like an ongoing battle for security, safety, and self-respect. Yet, amidst this chaos, I've learned one thing for sure: without the help of my family and a few genuine friends, I wouldn't have made it through these years. And trust me, when disaster strikes, you won't feel as strong as you thought you'd be.\n\nMy point is, emergencies will come in all shapes and sizes – and there's no way to prepare for everything. No matter how much you prepare, some situations are just too big to handle on your own.\n\nI agree that we should stop putting all our eggs in the US government's basket, as it's crumbling anyway. However, I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other, rather than building individual fallout shelters. The idea of rugged individualism that the Conservatives talk about is a myth; it was actually our ancestors' compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that kept them going through tough times. Those pioneers who crossed the Rockies didn't make it to the coast alone – they relied on their community.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare. I'm prepared – I've got a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and all the essentials. But it's not just about being prepared; it's also about building connections with your neighbors. Get to know the people around you, and work together to make your community stronger. If you've got the land and resources for a small farm, canning or preserving your own food is a fantastic idea, as is a wood stove – just make sure you don't live in an apartment.",
            "So, why do living things evolve the way they do? Is there some hidden force guiding the direction of change? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said zoologists were just starting to imagine describing organic forms in math terms, but we're not much further along today. Recently, math has been applied to the way shell-building creatures, like snails, grow and change over time (like their great-great-grandparents). Our study is exploring how math can help us figure out what makes the shapes of snail shells change. We took X-rays of snail species to measure the patterns that make up their shells, then plugged those numbers into this super cool computer program called CerioShell. We used those results to imagine what snail shells might look like if they'd evolved differently. We're combining that with some hands-on experiments to understand how shell shapes change over millions of years.\n\nImagine a snail shell as a spiral tube that grows and grows over time - it's like a big, twisty road that winds its way through space. Each twist is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a central axis (like a big, invisible pole) that runs through the shell's middle. The speed at which the whorls get bigger can vary, and there's a clear line between each twist, called a suture. In most shells, the biggest twist is the last one (the body whorl), and the rest are called the spire. The top point of the spire is the apex, and the bottom is the base. The snail sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at shells from different angles - from the top, from the bottom, from the front, or from the back. Usually, people look at shells with the aperture facing them and the apex pointing up.\n\nHere's a way to count the twists: first, look at the shell from the top, then find where the first twist starts. Draw a line that splits the shell in two, and then count the twists from there - you can even estimate a quarter of a twist if you're not sure. A shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through time and space as the snail builds its shell. By tracking the path of the hole, you can use math to understand how the shell grows. This lets you play around with different shell-building rules and see how they would affect the snail's shell shape.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has been pretty much the same for the past ten years.  It's weird because the country is doing okay on other things like getting clean water and sanitation, but it's really struggling to meet its targets for child and maternal health by 2015.  I'm gonna get into the reasons for this below, and they show that the country needs to improve its whole health system instead of just focusing on individual programs.\n\nIt's cool that Indonesia has gotten better at having skilled health workers at births, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  But what's strange is that this number includes traditional workers like midwives who can't do much if things get complicated.  So, the improvements in this area aren't as great as they seem, and there's still lots to be done.  The number of kids under five who get treated for diarrhea by a health pro has actually gone down, and the data on postnatal care is sketchy, but it's clear that this is a problem too.  We're talking low rates all over the country.\n\nC-section rates are way too low at about 4%, and that's not the only thing that's concerning.  The rates are way higher in cities (like 7%) than in rural areas (only 2%).  This shows that healthcare services are basically only available in cities.  Another problem is that some people can't access healthcare services because they can't afford it.  There's a huge gap in service use between the poorest and richest people in the country.\n\nNow we're talking about what to do next to improve neonatal and maternal care.  The big question is how to actually get more people access to healthcare services.  Should Indonesia focus on specific programs or strengthen its whole healthcare system instead of just focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for moms and babies?  I think program-specific approaches are tempting because they have clear goals and can produce quick results.  But there are some downsides.  One problem is that when we focus too much on one area, other areas don't get enough funding or resources.  Another problem is that all these separate programs can create a lot of extra work and duplication of services.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulously detailed descriptions and focus on the lives of the upper class during that era.  Two notable exceptions, however, are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These novels stray from the typical tradition by incorporating elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which helps to bring the characters to life and reveal their inner thoughts and emotions in a more profound way. \n\nOne of the most memorable scenes from an Oliver Twist passage reads: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n\nThese novels often use mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, but the specifics vary in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange events often provide insight into Oliver's inner turmoil, what torments him, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. When Oliver relives the shooting in chapter 28, it's like he's reliving it in a dream, as he desperately searches for help. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his dire situation, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he's re-experiencing his despair without the initial shock of pain, now linked with ongoing fear. This scene raises questions about whose fault Oliver's misfortune is, as it's clear it wasn't his own. This reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable to even attempt to change the outcome, even when his life is at risk. This scene also implies a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin has broken him, making him accept his despair and lose his ability to react. \n\nIn another passage from Wuthering Heights, we find: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "It's been a couple years since I worked with a bunch of Elementary aged students in an after school program, teaching them whatever subject they were struggling with. My strengths were in English and reading, but I did my best to help them out in other areas too. I was asked to work one-on-one with this kid named Adrian - I think he was in either third or fourth grade - who was really struggling to read. It was weird, though; I realized that this kid was having some pretty strange problems. Some letters he could read perfectly, while others were completely off. I figured it had to be something other than what I thought at first, since he spoke perfect English, but I'm pretty sure he's Latino. I worked with him for a while, trying to figure out what was going on, but it wasn't until I met his mom that things became clear. She walked in on us while we were hanging out (I was basically babysitting him while the rest of the group was on a field trip), and it turned out she only spoke Spanish. Using my limited Spanish skills, we were able to communicate a little bit, and it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read, but he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. I don't know if that little epiphany helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI tell this story to point out how language barriers can be a big problem in schools, especially here in California. I also want to show that it's not always as obvious as we think it is, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can be a huge obstacle for them. Everyone can agree on that, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There isn't just one answer. We've got dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of those things are going to fix this problem on their own.  The key is to combine them all.\n\nFirst off, I think the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for kids who speak Spanish as their first language, but for all of them. Apparently, kids in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of people are scared of this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit from it. But that's not true. If we made these programs the norm, rather than the exception, all kids would be helped by it. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That wouldn't be realistic or fair. But I think it's a good idea to have bilingual tutors, aids, or whatever you want to call them. That way, we can make these programs work.",
            "We've all been told from a young age that there's something out there that's beyond our understanding. Some of us go to church, while others go to temple or try to figure things out on our own. Many of us just stick with what our parents taught us, but others reject it all and think there's just nothing more to life than what we can see and touch. We might adopt one set of values, then change our minds and switch to another. Whatever we choose, we're trying to figure out who we are through our own way of looking at the world. We're searching for a light in the dark to guide us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain pound against the tin roof while we both smoked. He said his favorite kind of bird was the cardinal, and just kept staring off into the rain. He looked really thin, and his clothes hung loose on him. I knew he was struggling. I felt scared and alone, and I didn't want to talk about how much I was going to miss him because it would make it too real for both of us. So I just hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just a few days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had kept him alive when the doctors thought it was time to let go, but it was just prolonging the pain. I didn't know what kind of God would do that. I didn't pray that night, and if there was a God, I thought he had stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him die, so I didn't. I wanted to remember my dad for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone else, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to watch him go. So I just curled up in a ball and waited for the news. But nobody even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" seems like an oxymoron, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel - a mix of \"old\" and \"new.\" This genre has been both praised and criticized for its superficiality and its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create the prototype for the Gothic genre. By blending old theatrical clichés with new, naturalistic writing styles, Walpole created what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic literature often incorporates nods to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's release, the term \"gothic\" was already associated with various peoples, styles, and time periods, implying it was outdated and unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The combination of the theatrical, old-fashioned \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format, which provided readers with a more personal glimpse into character psychology, helped the Gothic genre endure and remain relevant, becoming both outdated and new to readers who came across it long after its initial writing.\n\nOne of the key ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, which involves training a proper knight, is reinterpreted in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry was essential to Gothic writers like Walpole because it represented the ideal knight - brave, honorable, and competent - and contrasted it with the perceived lack of these ideals in their own society. By romanticizing and idealizing the chivalric past, Gothic writers attempted to improve the present. Given the tumultuous political climate when Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, and the unfair accusations he faced, it's possible that he believed the morality and goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This idea is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as his royal status, his history of suffering, and his supposed bravery in the face of tragedy. The description of Frederic is riddled with traditional chivalric images, making him an exaggerated representation of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" trope, which would later become a hallmark of Gothic literature (Walpole 66).",
            "The flow of goods from the point when a customer places an order all the way back to the raw materials stage is referred to as supply chain management. Keith Oliver, a consultant, coined the term in 1982. He described the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the entire supply chain in order to meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently. The six key components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these six components to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nThe first step in the supply chain process is production. It serves as the foundation for the entire chain. The production stage outlines the when, why, where, and how of production. To do this, managers need to figure out what customers want. One way to do that is by analyzing the market, which is the biggest indicator of customer demand. Once managers have a handle on customer demand, they can decide what products to produce and how many to make. They also need to decide where the products will be produced and which plant will be the best fit for volume and quality, all while keeping the customer's needs in mind. After that, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Every detail is crucial in the production process. If not planned carefully, it can end up costing the company a lot of time and money in the long run.\n\nFor instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a blueprint for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. Having a clear plan helps the company run smoothly and prevents confusion.\n\nThe second essential element in supply chain management is supply. It involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager needs to decide which division is best suited for the different processes of the product. They might also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity, which is the ability to provide high-quality products with flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "There's this wild sign on the street that says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". It's like something right out of a crazy dream. Ellen Page from Juno is standing on a corner, holding a cardboard sign with this unsettling message written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is this Southeast Asian country that's been ruled by a super oppressive government since 1962. They overthrew the government in a military coup, and things escalated quickly from there. In 2007, monks led some massive protests called the \"Saffron Revolution\" because of their bright orange robes. It was huge, with people from all over starting to take notice. At first, the government let them march, but then things got super violent - the military even broke into monasteries and attacked people. Journalists got arrested just for showing up, and a Japanese photographer named Kenji Nagai got killed for being in the middle of it all. The official death count is like, 13, but a high-ranking officer who defected from the army said there were thousands more. \n\nThis isn't new, man. Governments wanting to keep control over people has been going on forever. Ancient Roman emperors thought they were gods, Japanese emperors are basically considered divine, and our current prez, George W. Bush, has some weird connections to this Ted Haggard guy who's like the leader of some crazy group. There are so many examples of this - like that time in 1989 when people protested in Tiananmen Square and the Chinese government claimed only a few hundred died, but other sources say it was way more like 2,000-3,000. Then there was the Rwandan genocide where Hutu militias killed all these people, and of course, there was the whole \"Third Reich\" thing where Hitler and his crew went around killing Jews and others. It's all just super messed up.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his impressive lifespan, which allowed him to continually shape his orchestra and create new music. Although he's often not prominent on the piano in his compositions, Ellington's skill as a composer shines through in the rich and complex pieces he created that showed off each band member's abilities. He crafted the perfect setting for soloists to improvise, as well as tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted each musician's unique style. By doing this, he created a consistent tone for the orchestra and came up with unique sounds for each piece. Ellington's understanding of how each player sounded individually and how they fit together in a growing ensemble enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary mentions Creole Love Call as an example of Ellington using the human voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This showcases his early use of voice to add texture and color without words getting in the way. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a talent he continued to show throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece is full of interesting textures. Here's what it's got:\nChorus 1: A call-and-response between voice and reeds, where the voice starts smooth and melodic, then gets rougher at the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that builds on the basic melody and emphasizes some extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, with a subtle syncopated piano phrase backing it up.\nChorus 4: The full band repeats the first chorus with a call-and-response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds start the call-and-response in a high register, backed by stop-time syncopation from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the first chorus structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the \"growl\" technique, soloing like an instrument.\nTag: A short tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color is just one of his many stylistic traits that are all over his work. In Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) takes this idea even further, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There's this nagging feeling that she's had for a long time. It started when she was 14 and entered the teenage scene. It's been around for three years now, and she's convinced it's something more than just a thing - it's a person. But, weirdly, none of the guys she's met have caught her attention. Some have tried to impress her, but it's like they were speaking a different language. She's constantly questioning this strange desire, trying to figure out what's behind it. Her thoughts have come up with some theories, but nothing that really makes sense. So, she's just going with the flow, wondering what's going on with her.\n\nAt home, things are usually chill. Her parents are super laid-back and rarely argue with each other. They almost never argue with her either, except when she gets all independent and free-spirited. That's just her way of being, and they respect it. But today wasn't a chill day. As she wandered from room to room looking for some inspiration, she heard her mom let out a loud shriek from the kitchen. She rushed in, freaking out, and asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mom lying on the ground, gritting her teeth and saying \"Ow\" between short breaths. Her daughter sprang into action, trying to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mom was in a lot of pain, so she quickly asked, \"Okay, Mom, where can I pick you up?\" Her mom gave her directions, and she was grateful she'd taken those self-defense classes - she was able to lift her mom and get her into the car.\n\nThe hospital had that weird mix of antiseptic and sickness smells, but she was too worried about her mom to notice. She rushed in and started calling for help, and soon a bunch of worried faces were around her mom, looking her over. They quickly wheeled her mom in, and she was left sitting there, worried sick. It turned out her mom had slipped off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to establish a link between following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. To achieve this, a modified version of the Med diet, named \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet, was used in the study. The aMed diet is characterized by a diet high in plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, but low in animal products and saturated fats. A moderate amount of alcohol was allowed. \n\nPast studies already showed that sticking to a Med diet is linked to lower risk of total and heart-related (CVD) mortality, and a trial proved that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in helping people lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, previous research did not focus on the relationship between the Med diet and stroke.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term research project involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six occasions between 1984 and 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score based on the participants' self-reported diets, which they had detailed in food frequency questionnaires. More than 95% of the nurses remained involved in the study for the entire 20-year period. The accuracy of the reported diets was verified through separate studies. When medical records or death certificates weren't available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included in the research, which made up about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks.\n\nEssential data like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were also documented for each food frequency questionnaire. Starting in 1986, the participants' leisure-time physical activity was also recorded. To reduce individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated the average aMed score over two years by combining scores from the previous two questionnaires. The study controlled for factors that could influence the results by adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical model, the researchers analyzed the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke. The results showed that women who followed the Med diet closely, indicated by a higher aMed diet score, were at a lower risk of developing heart disease and stroke. Over the course of 20 years, the researchers found 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of developing both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "Back in 2007, the United States was hit with a huge financial disaster. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market went down the drain, and many of America's biggest companies were left in shambles. This recession has stuck around, so we have to ask: what caused this mess, and how can we fix it? To get to the bottom of it, let's just say it all started with some super selfish and clueless politicians who made some pretty reckless decisions that tricked banks and companies into giving out bad loans. These loans went to people who couldn't afford them, and the financial system wasn't ready to handle it. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to back these mortgages and package them up into some complicated securities. When people started defaulting on these loans, the banks were in a tight spot and passed the buck to the people who had bought the repackaged mortgages. It was like a big domino effect, and the whole economy got knocked down.\n\nThe roots of this mess go way back to the Clinton days, when President Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he relaxed the rules on lending, which set the stage for the sub-prime crisis years later. Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote in 1999 that Fannie Mae was getting in big trouble because it was being forced to give out loans to people who couldn't afford them. Holmes even predicted that this would lead to a huge problem: \"The government-backed company might tank in a recession, leading to a huge bailout like the one in the 1980s.\" And guess what? He was right! As we all know, bad lending can lead to a total economic meltdown.\n\nA bunch of factors combined to make things worse, like these crazy new mortgage deals. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were all the rage back then, and they just made things more complicated. This led to people and companies getting way too invested in the housing market, making them super vulnerable to even small changes in prices. And then, BAM! The housing bubble burst, and all the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities got burned. The top five US investment banks were stuck with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which was like 30% of the country's entire GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold for pennies on the dollar, Lehman Brothers went down, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks with super strict rules. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in debt and got taken over by the government in 2008.",
            "Okay, let's talk about exposition.  You know, that part in a story where you take a deep breath and try to wow your readers with your writing, but sometimes they just end up falling asleep or hitting the \"Back\" button in frustration.  Dr. Merlin has been there too, yelling at her monitor when she gets stuck in Too Much Information land.\n\nExposition is basically a writing nemesis that tempts you to tell instead of show.  You already know the basic rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's still easy to get sucked into boring passages that don't move the story forward.  Exposition is like that pesky voice in your head that says, \"Just get the backstory out of the way so we can get to the exciting parts.\"\n\nSo, what is exposition exactly?  It's when you tell your readers what happened, usually in a straightforward way.  In movies, it's like when one character spouts off a bunch of info to another - like a \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" marathon.  As a writer, you're the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's look at an example.  Imagine you're reading a story and suddenly you're hit with a few paragraphs of info about the heroine's love life: she met her husband, they got married in a big ceremony, and he got murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect that whole sequence to take up two pages, with both characters only getting two lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to flesh out the husband's character through his words and actions, so you can see how much he loves his wife.  You'd also want to get a glimpse of how her life changed with him and how she felt about him.  That way, when the author tells you they had an amazing connection, you'll believe it and care about what happens to them.\n\nIn short, you want to add some meat to the bare bones of the story.  Instead of just saying \"They met, they married, he died,\" you want to make it feel real.  It's tempting to rush through the details, but trust us, it's worth taking the time to make it count.  For example, let's say you're introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station, was married twice, and has all these other traits.  Don't give your readers a laundry list - show them through his actions and dialogue instead.  It's easier to get caught up in the story that way.",
            "Today I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio - an NBC 4 live report this morning (August 13, 2011) and a few other stories. The first one I saw was about a dude named Shad Hostettler who knifed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They showed his mugshot and, let's just say, he looked like the baddest of the bad. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still developing. I think they got it right, though. \n\tThe next story was about some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers getting shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was in critical condition, and the SWAT Team was on the case, but no arrests had been made yet. This story felt kinda short, and I'm wondering if it's because the victim was black. I've noticed that when minorities get hurt or get murdered, it's like they fade into the background. If a white kid or adult gets kidnapped or gets hurt, the news goes crazy, but when it's a minority person, they're lucky if they even get a mention. \n\tThey also did a piece on the gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter. They said the bullet was probably from a .22 caliber rifle, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that'll lead to the shooter. \n\tAfter that, they did a tease for some thunderstorms and rain on Saturday afternoon, saying the temps would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. They kept it short so we'd stay tuned. \n\tThey also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said the robber was a dark-skinned black guy wearing a hoodie and a sweatshirt. They went on and on about how dark he was, which seemed kinda weird. \n\tAnother story was about some dude named Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who'd been caught selling a lot of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. What caught my eye was when they said he got sentenced to 300 months in prison instead of 25 years. I'm not sure what the point was there - maybe they thought it sounded harsher or what. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but that didn't seem super relevant to the story.",
            "There's a special connection between brothers that's unbreakable and unshakeable - a bond that's filled with a mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and sometimes even cruelty. Brothers have a way of understanding each other that's deeper than any other kind of connection, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. It's when things get really tough that the true nature of this bond really comes out - whether it's good or bad. When these emotions are clear, they come with a big price tag. Part of understanding the emotions that come with being a brother is dealing with the consequences that come with them. When you can look a brother in the eye and see your own reflection staring back at you, you see yourself for who you really are, not how others see you. It's in your actions and the consequences of those actions that you really find out what you're made of. In the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this theme and all the crazy emotions that come with it. They set out on this wild journey through a vivid and beautiful landscape, but it's all for nothing in the end. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the most intense moment, and only one brother makes it out alive. The theme is shown through how the characters act and talk to each other, and also through the narrator's point of view, which helps us see how the protagonist feels and sees the world around him. \n\nThe whole story is all about one main emotion: the protagonist's pride. From the very beginning, he's super resentful of his little brother, Doodle, who was born with a weak heart and can't do all the cool things the protagonist wants to teach him. He wanted a brother who could be his partner in adventure, but Doodle's condition makes that impossible. The protagonist even thought about killing Doodle at one point, which is just crazy, but when Doodle smiles at him, it makes him realize he actually loves his little brother deep down. It's like his heart was beating with love all along, even if he didn't want to admit it. The story shows how the protagonist's love and anger towards Doodle are always at war, and in the end, it's a battle he can't win.",
            "My brain is like, super complicated and creative, you know? It's like it's got its own way of processing information. Over time, how we've described it has changed with the advancements in tech. Initially, it was like a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and now it's compared to a computer. However, keep in mind that these comparisons aren't that accurate and might lead to some pretty big misunderstandings. \n\nWhen I'm learning about my brain, I'm picking up that it gets info from my senses first. It takes the physical things like touch, heat, sound waves, or light and turns them into these electrochemical signals. The brain breaks down this info in two ways – bottom-up and top-down processing. When I look at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together simple stuff like color, orientation, and where the box starts and ends. Then top-down processing kicks in and uses that info to help me figure out what the box is, like a box and not a hole in the background. \n\nAfter that, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which brain processes I should let it in. For instance, when I look down at my shoes, my brain processes every blade of grass, but the attention filter keeps me from actually seeing them. But if I'm trying to hear my name in a crowded room, that filter lets the sound through. There are lots of stages of processing, and my brain goes back and forth with the attention filter a bunch of times.\n\nIn order for my brain to process info, it's gotta store it first. There are different types of memory – sensory, working, and long-term. First, it's gotta be encoded, and there are different ways to do that depending on the type of sensory info. For example, if someone's talking, my brain can encode it based on what it looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means. Once it's stored, my brain's gotta keep it. Animal studies have shown that working memory, which is like, temporary, is kept by an electrical signal looping through some neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are lots of different models explaining how the brain organizes knowledge, and they're all based on different things – like how people remember stuff or how computers work or how the brain is wired. One of these models is the semantic network, which says that there are these nodes representing concepts, and they're connected based on how related they are. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World paints a picture of a dystopian future where technology and a capitalistic society reinforce each other. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to seek instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a larger game, trapped in a single ideology controlled by the World Controller. By examining the novel through a Marxist lens, it becomes clear that Huxley has some major issues with these emerging systems. Terms like homogeny and reification are scattered throughout the book, hinting at his concerns about the economy of his time. \n\nHuxley uses satire to poke fun at capitalism by highlighting the concept of false consciousness. This basically means that regular folks don't really know their place in the economic hierarchy; they're too busy looking out for themselves. This is essentially the result of ideological control over the working class, something that's super obvious in Brave New World. The lower classes are basically mindless drones, conditioned through hypnopædia to desire, consume, and indulge above all else. The World Controller is behind it all, manipulating the masses like pawns on a chessboard. The idea of hegemony – where one group dominates another – is totally at play here. The lower classes are oblivious to the manipulation, blindly following the ideology that keeps them in line. The upper classes, on the other hand, are aware of it, but they just accept their place in society. Only a few characters, like Bernard, seem to care about the bigger picture. The way the social classes interact with each other is a huge indication of the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are basically non-existent. The novel seems to strip away any depth or emotion from its characters, even the main ones. Huxley might be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together is stripping people of their free will and individuality. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by shallow interactions that are purely physical or superficial. The way characters talk about each other, focusing on appearance rather than substance, is a big clue. The fact that each social class is content with their place in the hierarchy is a clear indication of how capitalism affects people's perceptions of themselves and their place in society.",
            "So, I've been at University Park for two and a half years. It's basically four and a half semesters for those who are counting. Getting around campus can be a real pain in the butt. Last year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is basically the last stop on campus, except for the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. I'd have to trudge from my place in Stuart Hall all the way to the Willard building near the middle of campus, which would take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially if the weather's lousy. I talked to an old alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were cut off from the rest of school by a huge empty space. Nowadays, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus keeps expanding, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? For a college campus, it's gotta be bikes. But it's not just about having a bike; people need to ride them, and the campus needs to be bike-friendly.\n\nI was chatting with a friend who recently got back into biking after taking a few years off, and he was saying how he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for you, but it's also super efficient. You can pack a bowl of oatmeal and get 30 miles or more out of it – not bad for a little exercise. I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I did this year was buy a bike. Now, every day, I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with a bike, I can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal hard enough. The problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. I've got to give credit to walking, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up a ton of my time – over two and a half hours every week. That's time I just can't afford to waste."
