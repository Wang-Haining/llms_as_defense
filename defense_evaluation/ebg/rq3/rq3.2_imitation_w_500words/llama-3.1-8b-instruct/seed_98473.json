            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I pursue my education in social work, I'm set on a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to make a difference in the lives of abused or neglected kids, and to lend a helping hand to struggling families. Some key values that I'll bring to the social work field are service, respect, ethics, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional skills – staying on top of my game, so to speak. These aren't just important for social workers; they're personal values for me too.\n\nGrowing up, I always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to take. During high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and some dealing with issues in not-so-great ways. After witnessing some pretty tough stuff, I decided to go for a degree in Psychology. Still unsure about my next step, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old kid who was really struggling – he'd run away from his abusive parents. The next day, he called the cops on them. I went to their house, where I told the police about my concerns and shared that I had a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. They asked me to speak with the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I talked to the parents, they seemed really nervous and made excuses for their kid's actions. After that, I seriously considered a career in social work to help kids deal with family drama.\n\nSocial justice is another value that's super important in the social work field. We say that individuals matter, but in reality, we're often more about conforming to old traditions than being unique. If we're all about mourning lost individuals, then why do we try to be like everyone else? I'm an individual and I don't want to put limits on myself to fit in with the crowd. In high school and college, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could – I colored my hair weird colors, wore clothes that fit my personality, got my ears pierced in a more alternative way, joined GSBA, and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fighting against it.",
            "The following study delves into the biological and sociocultural models associated with insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic factors that are passed down through generations as well as the medical aspects of overall health. On the other hand, the sociocultural model looks at how environmental factors, such as ethnicity, demographics, socioeconomic status, and more, contribute to the disorder. This paper will explore and examine the various pieces of research related to these models in order to better grasp their intricacies. An analysis of the research findings and their strengths and weaknesses will be presented in this review.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three distinct groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders connected to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental health issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssonmias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining a restful sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by an excessive desire to stay awake, both lasting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. \n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genetic factors, heritable traits, and the physiological aspects of sleep. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, as discovered by Matsuki et al. (2009). This study implies that findings from animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This has significant sociocultural implications, as the phenotype could be inherited, regulating sleep, and any alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep patterns for an individual. This, in turn, could impact daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This paper explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain handles what we hear. Put simply, people with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain can't properly sort out what's going on. I mean, imagine trying to have a conversation at a loud party - it's hard to focus on what one person is saying when there's a lot of background noise, right? That's kinda what's happening with CAPD. It's not that they can't hear, it's just that their brain can't separate the good stuff from the noise. \n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first started studying kids with communication problems. They called it \"auditory imperception\" back then, but now we know it as CAPD. A team of Italian researchers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, actually started developing tests for CAPD back in 1954. Later, in 1961, Kimura came up with a model that explained how the brain handles different sounds, and it's been a topic of study ever since.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like? Well, it can manifest in all sorts of ways. Some people might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from, or they might get confused by different sounds happening at the same time. They might struggle to recognize patterns or changes in speech, like when someone says something sarcastically. It's like their brain gets all mixed up and can't untangle what's going on. And if you're trying to listen to two people talking at the same time, it can be super hard for them to block out one sound and focus on the other.\n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors and other specialists use a bunch of different tests. They might ask questions and observe how people respond to different sounds, like a bunch of words or numbers all at once. It's not like there's one magic test that can diagnose it, but it's all about getting a sense of how the brain handles sound. Some tests even use fancy equipment to record sounds and see how the brain responds. And, at the end of the day, there's no known cause for CAPD, so it's all about figuring out the best way to help people deal with it.\n\nTeachers in mainstream classrooms can help out by being aware of these common \"red flags\" - you know, the signs that might indicate someone has CAPD. They can use special techniques to make it easier for students with CAPD to focus and understand what's going on.

The thing is, getting rid of that deception can also make you pretty alienated from others, since some people might not take it well. You're basically stuck between saving yourself or keeping your relationships with the people around you. While some will be all chill about it, others will freak out and be totally turned off by the whole thing. \n\nThe part about disguising yourself as the opposite gender gets really tricky because it brings up a bunch of other issues. Like, why do people do it in the first place? In Viola's case, she pretends to be a dude so she can protect herself from people trying to hurt her. She's a bit like, \"Hey, I'll just go to this captain and he'll help me hide out near Count Orsino so I can serve him.\" (She's talking about her plan at the beginning of Act 5, Scene 1.)\n\nSo, Viola dresses up as a guy and it works, but it also makes her lose touch with the women around her and makes her miss out on a support system. And to make matters worse, she's so good at pretending to be a dude that Olivia gets all confused and starts thinking she's a guy named Sebastian and falls for her. Then there's the whole thing with Viola and Orsino, who's all like, \"You've told me a million times you wouldn't love a woman like me.\" (Act 5, Scene 1, again.)\n\nBut, looking at it from today's perspective, Twelfth Night can be seen as a way to show how deception can help people figure out things they've been hiding, especially for Olivia and Orsino. There are some parts that seem to hint that Olivia might be secretly into women, but I guess that's not really what it's about. Olivia's more likely just making fun of people who judge others based on looks. It's pretty clear when she starts to really like Sebastian and forgets all about Cesario/Viola. It's like she says, \"You're like a sister to me.\" (Act 5, Scene 1.) It sounds like Olivia is just messing with people who judge based on appearance.",
            "You can't even begin to understand the real deal about German colonial rule. I mean, yeah, it was super brutal, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa. But you can't just lump the whole empire into one neat little package. It was all over the place with different policies and styles in every colony, just like how it varied in geography. Education was no exception - some colonies were actually doing pretty well, like German East Africa (now Tanganyika) where the Brits found a bunch of super smart and literate Africans in 1919. They were even giving German colonial efforts in Kamerun and other places a thumbs up from authors back in the day.\n\nBut then there's South West Africa (now Namibia), where things were super different. Unlike East Africa where the government was all about setting up schools and educating the locals, in South West Africa they basically left it all to the missionaries who were getting pretty minimal support from the government. Yet, they still managed to throw a ton of resources at educating Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and regulating the missionaries. This all had some major long-term effects on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies were rocking with educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa \"most people were basically clueless, uneducated, and illiterate.\" There were a bunch of reasons for this, and I want to dive deeper into them in this paper, especially the attitudes of settlers and colonial officials towards the locals.\n\nThere's a bunch of research out there on education in the German colonies, but most of it is in German and from the early 20th century. These early works were all about describing the educational systems in these colonies. Later stuff in English expanded on it by comparing education in different colonies and getting into the nitty-gritty of specific aspects. It turns out that every colony was doing its own thing with education, and the most famous work on this topic is probably Cohen's study of South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the two and talks about the factors that made them so different. Apparently, the big settler population in South West Africa is a major reason for the difference.\n\nSouth West Africa was pretty chill for Europeans, with a relatively nice climate, but most of the land was basically a desert. This made it super appealing to Europeans, and by 1913 there were almost 15,000 of them living there, which was way more than in any other colony except East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music has undergone a huge transformation over the past 100 years, expanding into so many different genres that it's a real challenge to make a list of them all. To make matters even more complicated, most of these genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres within their own domains. I'm gonna argue that the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most expressive and diverse genres of popular music in the last 40 years. It's expressive because it showcases a wide range of emotions, mostly on the darker side of the spectrum, but also because it's incredibly flexible, allowing people to take it in their own unique direction. \n\nYou could say we've reached a point in the heavy metal movement where it's hard to pinpoint what exactly heavy metal is, given how many niches and sub-niches it's branched out into by incorporating elements from other genres. But to truly understand the metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta understand the metal movement itself and where it all started. It's actually defined by darkness, heavy metal being the \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatrics. It's about musicians who really know their craft, and that skill shines through in the music. Some say metal is also a movement heavily influenced by psychedelics, which were all the rage in the 70s, and were used as a creative outlet for musicians to tap into their wilder side. This music often deals with the darker aspects of life, which was a new and exciting thing back in the day when most popular music was pretty laid-back. Some later metal bands even took a cue from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Some lyrics that showcase the darker side of metal include the following from Helter Skelter, which is like a showcase of the Beatles' wilder side. This song is actually considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs, as a response to a similar song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they added this song to The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealists were painting their trippy works, Henri Rousseau was busy living his own dream, literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, isn't just some chick checking out the sights in a fantasy world – it's also a reflection of his own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. For years, Rousseau wanted the art world to give him a shout-out, and he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, he wanted to fit in with the cool art kids and follow the latest styles, but on the other hand, he wanted to be true to himself and paint his own way.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's backstory. He was born on May 21, 1844, in some small town in northwest France. His dad was a hardware dealer who was pretty well-off, but Rousseau didn't get any fancy art training. Instead, he worked for the French government as a toll collector until he was 40. People called him a customs inspector, but that's not exactly what he was. After his first wife and eight little kids died, Rousseau was left with just one kid, Julia, and a whole lot of sadness. Painting was his escape, his way to start fresh. Unlike some other artists of his time, Rousseau wasn't all about painting pretty peasants; he was a folk painter, and his art was all about regular people's hopes and dreams.\n\nIt's no wonder Rousseau wanted the art world to like him. I mean, he was basically starting from scratch, and he was doing it at an older age than most artists. Plus, he was competing with some super talented and famous artists. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was getting famous that Rousseau started getting recognition for his work. In his book, Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says that Rousseau and Matisse were like total opposites. Matisse was all about not being boring, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would accept him as a real artist.",
            "A lot of deep thinkers have suggested that ethics and aesthetics are close friends - that truth and beauty are connected in some way. I think there's a reason for this that goes all the way down to the basics. As John Keats says in his poem, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we learn in life comes from school or personal experience, but we tend to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing to be taught. Ethics and aesthetics are both about trying to figure out why something is beautiful or moral, as opposed to providing a set of rules for creating good art or good behavior. \n\nTo get to the point, people can never really put their finger on exactly what makes something good or beautiful. Talking about the value of something like the Mona Lisa might involve stuff like background, foreground, or cultural context, but these things don't capture what makes it good art. When people talk about their favorite piece of art, they often say something like \"There's just something about it\" before getting into the details. I think that both art and morals have this thing that can't be totally explained. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how well we describe a work of art, there's always something more to it. I think morality has the same property. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think this \"something\" that's hard to put into words is what makes art and morality so powerful, and it's what connects them.\n\nI believe that morals and art are connected because we experience them at a deep, almost unexplainable level. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a country that's really come together, with its own unique vibe that's all over the place - from the mountains in München to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You can feel that culture in Köln, right on the Rhine River, all the way to Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise it's got such a cool culture considering it's made up of lots of different tribes and sources. They call it Germania, the land of the Germans, but nobody really knows where the name came from. Some think it's from a tribe called the Tungrians, and they were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (check out Tacitus, 98).\n\nJulius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his book about the Gallic Wars, which was all about beating up the Gauls and dealing with Germanic tribes that were always crossing the Rhine. He got the word from the Gauls themselves and used it to tell the difference between people he'd already conquered and those he hadn't. He even wrote about how the Germans were always at war with the Gauls in his book. Some people think the name comes from a spear they used in battles called a ger, or maybe from the Old Irish word \"garim\", which means they were super loud or rowdy. \n\nIn his book, written in 98 AD, Tacitus said that the Germans were basically a pure-blooded people who didn't mix with other cultures. He even wrote about how nobody would just leave Asia or Africa to come to Germany, which was pretty rough and wild. So, the Romans didn't really want to live there, but they did go there to trade and fight sometimes. Germanic tribes started showing up in the first century, and they'd trade goods and skills with the Romans, who mostly just went home after their campaigns.",
            "My eyes were fixed on something in front of me, but my mind was elsewhere, blank and unresponsive.  I went through the motions, staring at this thing, but it was like my brain was in a different room, studying it without really thinking about it.  Thoughts would pop up for a second, and then they'd be gone, like a fleeting thought that never really stuck.  It was like I was just going through the motions, not really thinking for myself, just experiencing whatever I was looking at.\n\nI'd picked up this art book a while back, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, after an artist I worked with suggested it.  I'd always wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book was supposed to teach me the basics.  One trick it showed was to draw a square around whatever picture you're looking at, to simplify it and make it easier to understand.  I tried to do that, but at the time, I was so blown away by what I was looking at that I couldn't even think about drawing a frame around it.\n\nI was staring at this bowl of fruit, and all I could do was stand there, frozen in awe.  I thought about all the famous artists who'd done their own weird things with art - Picasso and his blue phase, Monet and his love of greenery, the Renaissance masters and their colorful stuff.  If I wanted to be an artist, then this was my chance to start something new, to make my own art.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand reached out and picked up my pencil, and for a second, I felt like I was creating something amazing.  But then I had to go use the bathroom, and that's when things started to go wrong.  I tried to, ah, \"create\" something in the toilet, but it just wouldn't budge.  I was getting a little anxious, and my hand was starting to shake.  I looked at the, um, \"art\" I was trying to create, and I just couldn't help but frown.  It was a real mess.\n\nI gripped the mop a little tighter, and I thought about how I was going to have to deal with this later.  I was already feeling pretty stressed out, and now I had to add this to the list.  I looked at the, ahem, \"masterpiece\" in front of me and just shook my head.  It was gonna be a long day...",
            "Teen drivers are a major cause of concern in the US.  Several factors contribute to this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say that one reason is that the teen brain is not ready to handle the risks of driving.  Teens also lack experience, which leads to more fatal accidents, a higher rate of rollover incidents, speeding, and driving off the road.  When teens drive with their friends, the danger increases even more.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the number of traffic accidents goes up as the age of the passenger gets younger.\n\nIn an attempt to make driving safer for teens, some states require temporary licenses that limit the number of hours they can drive and don't allow minors as passengers.  However, these licenses are only temporary fixes.  The real issue is that teens are, statistically, not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Marvin Zuckerman, a psychologist, thinks that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license.  He's done research showing that people under 19-20 often take risks just for the thrill of it.  This makes sense, so it's a good idea to delay driving until the tendency to take risks has decreased.  If we keep giving out driver's licenses to young teens, we'll see more deadly accidents and the death toll will probably get really high.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road.\n\nMaking new laws to deal with this issue would be pretty simple.  Schools could still offer driver's education classes to teach future drivers the basics, but no one under 18 could drive.  We could still give out temporary permits before a full license, and require a certain number of driving practice hours.  The number of hours could be the same as most states require now (like 6 hours of driving lessons and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California).  Since this problem affects all states, a national law would be a good way to protect teen drivers across the country.  This idea isn't new, but it could really make a difference.",
            "I spent the day browsing through the early Edison films at the Library of Congress and decided to check out all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and they're all about using editing tricks to create illusions. I mainly analyzed the poetic aspects of these films and looked at how some of the later ones broke the rules. Back in the day, trick films were pretty set in their ways - they were static, stuck to a frontal proscenium, used long shots, and just one shot per film. It was like a one-trick pony, you know? But around the turn of the century, some films started to get a little wild and crazy and added in some new stuff like multiple shots.\n\nWhat really stood out to me about these trick films was that they were all shot on interior sets with a proscenium in the background. The camera never moved, no matter what. It was like it was stuck in one place, just like in a play or a magic show. I guess this is where the idea of a static set comes from - it's like a trapped stage. When I watched Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), I noticed that the actors would just move side to side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Even when they left the frame, the camera didn't budge. It was like they were stuck in some kind of weird, two-dimensional world.\n\nThese early trick films also stuck to long shots and occasional medium shots. Never any close-ups, just like in a play where the audience sees the whole scene at once. It's like the camera is trying to show you the whole performance at once, like a big ol' play. And the actors never move towards the camera, so you never get any close-ups. It's like they're stuck in some kind of frozen moment in time.\n\nMost of these early trick films are super short, like, under a minute, and they're all about doing one trick and getting out. It's like a magic show, where they just do a few tricks and then it's over. But, when you look closer, you realize that some of these films are actually made up of several short shots joined together to create some crazy illusion. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example - it looks like one shot, but if you really pay attention, you can see where the actual camera cuts happen.",
            "So there's this guy John Taylor from Caroline, and he was super into Republicanism from the get-go. He was a farmer at heart, but even with his farming and his brief stint in politics, he was known for being super outspoken about personal freedom and the government. His love for agriculture basically dictated his views on almost everything, including the government, sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system. He was all about preserving and promoting the best of the best when it came to careers, which influenced his arguments on just about everything.\n\nTaylor thought the US had a shot at creating the perfect system because they didn't have any pre-existing traditions to mess things up - it was a blank slate, basically. He was all about natural rights and how they're all connected - if one gets taken away, they all suffer, and the ones that are left are basically worthless. He believed these rights should be off-limits to the government. He thought the so-called \"state of nature\" was all about people with power and bad intentions getting ahead, but that shouldn't be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo make this ideal society a reality, Taylor believed a government had to be designed with both good and evil in mind. He was pretty rigid in his views on dualistic morality - he thought government is basically just a reflection of human nature. He said that governments have good and bad principles, and good principles are all about protecting private property, improving agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He thought a government with good principles would be fair no matter who was in charge, but the reality is that governments are usually run by greedy people. He believed self-interest was the driving force behind everything humans do, but it's only bad when it leads to a society that exploits others. A good government is necessary to keep humans' natural badness in check, but it needs to be watched closely to avoid adding any bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of other super-hardcore Republicans back then, was all about interpreting the Constitution super strictly. He wanted a super limited Federal government that only had the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew a big Federal government would be expensive and likely to become a dictatorship, but he also thought that just following the literal words of the Constitution without considering the writers' intentions could be super corrupt. And, to him, the Declaration of Independence was basically the US's true charter because it clearly states that we're a bunch of separate states rather than one country.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, it's clear that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was pretty discouraging, and it's hard to say exactly why it happened. One thing that might have contributed to it is that winter set in at our New England campus, which probably led to fewer people biking or walking to school. It's also possible that the end of the fall semester and the holiday season just got in the way – everyone was too busy finishing schoolwork and grades to bother filling out the log. Plus, the month-long break at the end of the semester probably meant a lot of people didn't need to come to campus at all. When classes resumed in January, we saw another low number of submissions, but that still doesn't explain the dip in February. It could be that people just got bored with the project after the initial excitement wore off. To counteract this, we tried something called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which actually worked and boosted log submissions for that month. We figured out that one of our biggest challenges was getting people to stay engaged despite the natural decrease in interest, and also dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that are just part of higher education. \n\nAnother problem we faced was that a lot of people really love driving their cars, and that's just a big part of our culture. So we had to come up with incentives to get people to try alternative modes of transportation. We gave out some pretty cool prizes, like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, would have made a difference – but unfortunately, we didn't get to try that out. We kept the same type of prizes throughout the project, but if we had announced some bigger prizes in December or January, it might have kept people engaged instead of losing interest. I mean, who wouldn't want to win a bike or a car?",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is pretty cool because it's like a security that copies an index, a commodity, or a bunch of assets, just like an index fund, but it's way more flexible and trades like a stock on the exchange.  It gives you the benefits of an index fund, like diversification, and the perks of owning a single stock, like being able to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase just one share at a time.  These benefits are super attractive, but the fees for ETFs are way lower than the average mutual fund.  However, there are some downsides, like you have to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just like with a stock order.  Another awesome thing about ETFs is that there's a huge variety of funds available.  But, it's always smart to be a savvy financial investor and check if the benefits you're told about, like diversification, are actually real, and how real they are.  For now, we're going to check out the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is just as good as owning a bunch of individual stocks.  \n\nTo make things less overwhelming, we're only going to look at the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  The top 10 holdings are listed below, along with their percentage of the total assets.\n\nBy looking at how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets to calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF has them.  The calculations for Beta and Return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's pretty clear that a portfolio made up of just the top 10 holdings would return 6.11% more than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It's also pretty evident that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  So far, it seems like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a higher return with a lower Beta.  But, there's a chance that the means of these two portfolios might not be all that different statistically.\n\nTo figure out if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compared it to the standard deviation of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-Land is often considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's improved poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott thinks is linked back to the writings of Virgil. However, it's also possible that Poe got it from a more recent source - he was a big fan of German authors. \n\nThis connection is pretty significant because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt noticed in his book that Poe's poem Politian is similar to Goethe's Mignon, which led him to believe that Poe might have been inspired by Goethe. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says that Goethe was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust, which came out in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year he died. There's a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\" hidden inside the second part of Faust. It's about a king who loses his wife and starts drinking heavily, then decides to die after remembering his dead queen. He throws away his goblet and walks to a cliff, where he dies. The King of Thulé and the character in Dream-Land have some pretty strong similarities, maybe even a dark opposite of Poe's own struggles with loss and drinking. \n\nFaust was also turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe mentions Thule twice in his collected works - once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" to bookend the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place with dead friends and a world without color. This sounds a lot like the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem, who's just lost his wife and is feeling pretty down. It's like the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" stepped right into Goethe's poem. \n\nGoethe was a pretty big deal in the literary world, and Poe would have likely known about him, even if it was just through his respect for Tennyson. Poe said something about how he admired Tennyson, and he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through all the reproductions that were going on after the original publication.",
            "In California, if a customer slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store and got hurt, can they get punitive damages if the store manager knew about the spill but didn't clean it up for half an hour because he was too busy eating dinner? A judge's probably not gonna dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages right away. To win their case, the customer needs to show that the manager acted with a super bad and on purpose disregard for how his actions would affect people, and that his actions were really, really bad. The customer can argue that the manager should've known how bad it would be not to clean up the spill because lots of other people had slipped and gotten hurt in the store before, and he still did nothing. The customer's argument that the manager's actions were super bad isn't super strong, but it's still kind of reasonable. This is because the store had six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager didn't do anything to make the store safer.\n\nOn October 13th at 5:00 pm, an employee of D&D Markets told the manager, Paul Martin, that there was a big applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin was like, \"I'm on dinner break, I don't have time for customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee told Martin about the spill again, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back really badly. Before Palmer got hurt, there were already five other slip-and-fall incidents reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for both regular damages and punitive damages, and we're figuring out whether to ask the judge to throw out the part of the claim about the punitive damages.\n\nIn California, people can get punitive damages if someone broke a law that wasn't related to a contract and acted with a really bad attitude, like being super mean or deceitful. The law says \"malice\" means either doing something on purpose to hurt someone, or doing something really, really bad with a total disregard for other people's rights or safety. Courts have said that it's like when someone knows that their actions are going to hurt people, but they do it anyway because they don't care. That's basically what the teacher in the Taylor case said in 1979.",
            "It's crazy to think it's been almost four years since I took that course on Islam at CBC.  We had this huge debate in class about whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I still think that question is super relevant today, especially considering how media's view on Islam has changed since 9/11.  It's wild to think that back in 2001, we wouldn't have even considered a presidential candidate with a Muslim background like Barack Obama.  \n\nThe Prophet's biography really got me thinking.  I learned in class that Muhammad was supposed to be some kind of conqueror who forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a whole different picture.  It's like, Muhammad comes across as this humble guy who's been misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  People started to see the 'truth' in his teachings and came to him on their own.  That's pretty different from what I thought I knew about him.\n\nWhat's also tripping me out is how similar the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's 'miracles' are.  Like, there's this one story where Muhammad takes some mutton and milk and it's enough for 40 people.  I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like this humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, just lived in truth and did miracles.  That's kinda problematic because it downplays Jesus' life and personhood.  It's like they're stealing from Jesus and trying to pass it off as Muhammad's story.\n\nThere are a lot of stories in the biography that are presented as 'proof' of people converting to Islam on their own, but they're all from third-party sources.  I mean, it's like the author's trying to say 'Hey, I heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so,' and it just doesn't feel real.  It makes me skeptical.\n\nWhat really gets me is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this godly, humble, and wise guy.  But history doesn't back that up, and I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Looking back, it seems that the teachings and ideas that Jesus lived by got lost in the shuffle when Christianity started evolving after his death.  If we look at Christian history in general, it's clear that it's strayed further and further away from its roots.  It's like the whole world is moving forward with a growing awareness and a trend towards progress, but the traditional folks are still stuck in their ways and resistant to new ideas.  They might not be influential enough to make a huge impact, though.  I think down the line, people will start to become more aware of their Christian history and wonder what the original plans were.  They'll start to figure out which parts of the religion were added over time and what the actual message of Jesus was.  It might take a while - decades or even centuries - but eventually, things will swing back around.  A big shift will happen in Christian history, and we'll move back to the way things were when Jesus first started spreading the word.  Instead of all these added layers of doctrine, we'll strip them away, one by one, until we're back to the basics of what Jesus taught us about God.  When this movement picks up speed in the US and Europe, it'll be like a big wave that sweeps through and changes things.  People will start to worship like we did back in Jesus' day, following what he said and believed.  The church as an institution will stay strong, but it'll lead people back to the basics, not the complicated ideas that have been added over time.  You'll see a big change from all the differences within Christianity to tons of similarities and a more uniform way of thinking.  It's not the first time this has happened, either - think about how the Roman Empire used to persecute Christians, but then they became the Christian empire, or how the US used to have African-American leaders at the bottom of society, but now they're leading the way.  A similar thing is going to happen in Christianity, where people will go back to the source and make things simpler and more unified.  To make all this happen, we need to start seeing Jesus' words as metaphors, not as literal statements.  So, let's go back to the beginning - what was Christianity like back in the day?  If we go way back, we find that it all started with Judaism, which was the core of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Jewish people already believed in one God, had a revealed religion, and followed the Hebrew scriptures.  But they weren't all on the same page - there were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a bunch of regular folks, all with different ideas.",
            "I think that The Jungle really shows how humans on the inside are pretty selfish and only think about themselves. They just try to make their lives better and don't really care about anyone else. This is super clear in the book when you look at the big factory owners and managers. All they care about is making their companies huge and rich and they don't even think about the people or the planet getting hurt because of it. Upton Sinclair writes some pretty sick stuff, like, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's basically painting a picture of how messed up the pollution is and how the owners don't even care about the animals or people getting hurt. They're all about making a buck, and don't care if it hurts the environment or the people working for them. Sinclair says it pretty bluntly, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". The owners and managers are all about making money, and they'll do whatever it takes to get it. They make people work crazy hours and then just get rid of them when they're not making enough money. Back then, there weren't really any laws to protect workers, so the owners could do whatever they wanted. The people working in the factories and living in Packingtown were basically treated like slaves. There were no organizations helping them or giving them information, and the unions were actually just making money off the poor workers. The workers were basically trapped in this system and were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Sometimes authors really know how to get you to feel a certain way about important stuff. They have a bunch of tricks up their sleeve to do this, and some of them work way better than others. In his book The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald is like a master of these tricks. One of the things he does is pair up words that don't usually go together to make you think about a subject in a certain way. Another thing he does is take a symbol and give it meaning, then use it again to make you feel something specific. Fitzgerald used this last trick with lots of colors, including gold, green, but also white/gray and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for white/gray and red/pink, then uses that meaning to make you feel a certain way about something important.\n\nFitzgerald makes white/gray into a symbol of something pretty specific: uniformity. White is like, higher class and nicer, while gray is more old and faded. He sets up this meaning at the very beginning of the book by using these colors all the time. Like, Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white, and not just them - everyone's always wearing white: Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is super pale and white. Actually, the only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick's describing Gatsby's party: the halls are all gaudy and bright. Fitzgerald keeps using these colors to describe regular, boring stuff too: as Nick goes to work, he goes down the white canyons of lower New York, the names of people at Gatsby's parties are just gray names on Nick's schedule, Catherine's apartment is just one part of a long row of white apartment buildings, and so on. He even describes plain people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a white girlhood together, there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes, the little Italian kid in the train is gray, and the dog-seller is a gray old man.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald builds up enough meaning with white/gray, he uses them to make you feel like some subjects are unimportant or uniform. This starts with Daisy. After a while without using these colors much, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as wearing white in a little white roadster, and you start to see her as just a uniform thing, something Gatsby wants but isn't really a person. He uses this technique with Daisy a bunch of times to make you feel like she's just a uniform addition, like when there's a gray haze around her fur collar, or when she's wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's big encounter.",
            "San Diego County is super good at growing food, thanks to its awesome weather and lots of sunshine. They grow all sorts of cool stuff like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and even tree fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries and honey are also super popular, and people love getting peppers. There's a huge demand for organic food in the area, and lots of local groups have super long waiting lists for their community-supported agriculture programs. People in San Diego also love buying organic eggs and milk. Many organic farms in the area even let you tour their operations and explore the land for hiking, birdwatching, and other fun stuff. This kind of setup is perfect for farmers who want to get government help while keeping the land healthy and making money through tours and other programs.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming are pretty sweet, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. For one, it takes a lot more work and management to get rid of pests and weeds without using chemicals, and you might lose more crops than with regular farming methods. Small organic farms also can't compete with big operations when it comes to efficiency. To make things better for wildlife, you've got to do things like plant cover crops, help animals move around the land, get rid of invasive species, and make sure the plants have the right conditions to thrive. That's a lot more work and costs more money, so farmers might need some help or expertise to make it all work.\n\nI picked a specific piece of land near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, as my example. It's 160 acres of beautiful chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland, right next to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is covered in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan looks at over a hundred different plants and animals, some of which are super endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are in trouble and might be listed as endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land has been home to Native Americans for who-knows-how-long and was later settled by cattle ranchers and people who sold wood in the 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing and wood production for a long time. I picked a real piece of property from a website and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might do to make organic farming work and keep the land safe for wildlife. I used a local organic farm in the same area as my example.",
            "Culture is a key factor in any negotiation, but it's often more about what it's not than what it actually is. It's not one-size-fits-all; instead, it's a complex and multifaceted thing that can change from situation to situation. You can't make blanket statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" because they're just too broad and oversimplify things. What's more helpful is understanding how a culture affects the negotiation at hand and how its attitudes might impact the talks. When you deal with a foreign culture, you're bound to compare it to your own, and that's when the real learning happens.\n\nTo get a handle on a different culture, you might need to study its history or learn about its prejudices. The goal is to accept it for what it is, not to judge or try to change it, especially when you're in a weaker bargaining position. If you're negotiating on foreign soil, showing respect for local traditions and customs can be a game-changer. It can help you get past any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nBut culture isn't just about national or international differences; it's also present within companies, too. Corporate culture can vary wildly depending on the company, from super-serious work hours to a more relaxed schedule. You can see evidence of it in things like dress codes, communication styles, and who gets hired. Take American companies, for example - they're all different, even within the same country. And it's not just about big differences between companies; even within the same company, there can be regional and urban/suburban differences. So, it's not always easy to tell what's going on beneath the surface.\n\nWhen it comes to values, that's where things get really important. They're what give a culture its underlying reasons for being. If saving face or community harmony is a big deal in a culture, you can bet that a negotiator won't go out of their way to shame their company or boss in public. And if a culture values getting a hard bargain, they won't be in a rush to settle just to get a deal done. Knowing these things can help you prepare for a negotiation, but it's also a good idea to get to know your opponent on a personal level to really make the negotiation work.",
            "\"The fool has said, 'There is no God.' This quote from Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible is also the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on God's existence and is found in the beginning of his reasoning. It's interesting to note that Thomas Aquinas seems to hold a similar view as well. Since we're about to discuss both of their arguments, which are basically about the same thing, we'll assume they're both right about the existence of God - the God of the Bible. If we consider a different version of God, it would be hard to compare their arguments because they're more or less just trying to prove the existence of the one in the Bible. I think what I'm getting at is that while both of them make some solid points, neither one really does a complete job of proving God's existence.\n\nLet's take a look at St. Anselm's argument first. Anselm basically says that to find out about God, you can look inside yourself. He says that because we already know God exists in our minds, it's impossible to imagine a world without him. When you break it down, he's saying that you don't need any outside evidence to prove God's existence - it's all about what you already know inside your head. This idea is often called faith, which means accepting something without all the facts. It's a pretty different approach from what St. Thomas Aquinas is saying.\n\nSt. Thomas thinks that you can use logic and evidence to prove God's existence without relying on faith. This would be super helpful for spreading Christianity because it would make it easier to convince new people to join without them having to believe something without proof. He's got five different logical arguments to back this up: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. What he's basically saying is that you can use logic to figure out that God exists, even if you can't see him. For example, imagine if someone told you that you're missing a puzzle piece, and you put all the others together - you can still figure out what the missing piece looks like without actually seeing it.",
            "It's a pretty weird feeling thinking that around 2,500 years ago or so, a prince would grow up to become the Buddha. I guess this guy would ditch the whole royalty thing and find enlightenment, which, in turn, led to the creation of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. I'm pretty sure it's changed a lot since the Buddha's time, though. You can see the difference in a place like Sri Lanka, where they have this wacky water-cutting ceremony. Everyone, monks and regular people alike, participate in it, and it's got some meaning, even though the Buddha never talked about it. These differences are all over the place, from the silly traditions to the deeper stuff that makes up the core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to modify its main ideas over time, both on its own and due to external influences. Sometimes these changes come from people who don't believe in Buddhism, but other times they come from within the community itself.\n\nYou might hear some new terms in this discussion, so let's define them. An internal force refers to something that comes from within the Buddhist community, while an external force is something from outside. A hostile force is anything that harms the Buddhist community, while a benign force doesn't try to hurt or help, even if it ends up doing one or the other by accident. These terms will pop up a lot in what I'm about to say.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the basics of Theravada Buddhism – the core stuff that makes it tick. Buddhists put their trust in three key things: the Buddha, the Dhamma (which is essentially all the Buddhist texts), and the Sangha (the community). The Dhamma is made up of three main parts – the Tripitaka – which includes the Sutta Pitaka (all the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (the rules of conduct), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the metaphysical stuff). The metaphysical stuff covers ideas like there's no permanent soul, life is full of suffering, and nothing lasts forever. If you can wrap your head around these concepts, you can break free from this cycle of death and rebirth. Along with that, you'll also kick the habit of desiring stuff, hating things, and being delusional. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for life, with five precepts for regular people (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't be all weird about sex, and don't get drunk) and a bunch more rules for monks. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, life is suffering; second, attachments cause suffering; and third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico have a pretty wild history that dates back to 1836 and lasted 57 years, from then to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p.145).  The craziest part of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US took down Mexico and got its hands on Texas and the American Southwest.  There were other smaller skirmishes between the two nations, but the fighting finally died down just before the First World War.  It all started because Americans and Mexicans had major disagreements about stuff like religion, culture, and stuff they thought was important, and they also had huge differences over what they wanted to gain. (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  \n\nThis rivalry thing isn't unique to the US and Mexico, by the way.  Lots of countries that share borders have clashes of interests that lead to them becoming rivals.  The US and Mexico aren't that different from other countries like this.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can you find long-lasting American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  Both of these countries are right next to the US and have been at odds with it, while other Latin American countries get along pretty well with the US.  \n\nReligious differences caused a huge rift between the US and Mexico, and this is something that's happened to a lot of other countries too.  Sally Frahm (2001) said that \"if Americans were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century, in the 18th and 19th they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86).  It's kinda like how the Cold War was a mix of ideological struggles and competing interests, but in this case, it was more about the US and Mexico having different ideas about what was important.  This distrust started because the US and Mexico inherited it from their former colonial rulers - the English and Spanish.  This made it tough for the two countries to have a good relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted 17 disputes between the US and Mexico during the 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes were about border stuff, like bandits and outlaws crossing the border and causing trouble.  It wasn't until both countries started using military force to control their borders that things started to calm down (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) said the rivalry started to fade away as \"Mexico became dependent on the US in a big way\" (p. 109) and eventually ended when American ambitions changed from trying to take over land to trying to influence Mexico's economy (p.110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I hit rock bottom after a mysterious illness left me disabled and unable to work. At the time, I was a nurse with a dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, but life had other plans. People kept telling me, \"You'll always find a job; people will always get sick,\" so I chose nursing as a secure career choice. Little did I know that my security would soon be turned upside down.\n\nFast forward to my life at 46: I'm single, broke, and living on disability checks. I've lost count of the days when I thought I had nothing left to call my own. Every day is a struggle to survive, and my self-esteem takes a hit. But one thing I know for sure is that I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few true friends. When disaster strikes, you realize how fragile you are, and how much you need the help of others.\n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies – big and small. No matter how prepared you are, some things are just too big to handle on your own. So, let's stop relying solely on the government to save us and start building a safety net of our own. Instead of bailing out to build our own fallout shelters, let's learn to trust each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe Conservatives talk about rugged individualism, but it was actually community and compassion that kept our ancestors going in tough times. The pioneers who trekked across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it by going it alone – they relied on each other for support.\n\nSo, be prepared, but don't forget the importance of community. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a stash of canned goods, but I also try to know my neighbors and look out for them. It's time for us to stop relying solely on ourselves and start building a network of people who will help each other out when things get tough.",
            "It's still a mystery why organisms evolve the way they do. There are probably some rules or boundaries that determine which way they change over time. Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson pointed out that biologists are still pretty clueless about describing the simplest living things in math terms. But more recently, math has been used to figure out how certain types of animals build their shells over time, like the way they grow and develop (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is working on using math to understand how animals like the ones in the Prunum family grow their shells and change over time. We're combining math with experiments to see what makes some of these animals change in certain ways. We looked at X-ray pictures of different Prunum species and used the information to create math models of their shells. These models helped us see what their shells could look like if they changed in different ways. Now we're combining these models with our experiments to learn more about how these animals evolved over time.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that moves through space over time. It's like a big spiral that goes around in a circle, and each part of the spiral is called a whorl. The middle of the shell is like an imaginary stick that runs through the middle of the spiral. This stick is called the columella. The speed at which the spiral grows can change, and the lines that separate each whorl are called sutures. Most shells have a big spiral at the end, which is called the body whorl. The rest of the spiral is called the spire. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at a shell from different angles, like looking at the top, bottom, front, or back. Most people look at shells with the front side facing them and the top pointing up. \n\nThere's a way to count the whorls on a shell. First, look at the shell from the top and find the first line where the whorls start to separate. Then draw a line to divide the shell in two. Count the whorls from this line, and you can even estimate a quarter of a whorl if you need to.\n\nA shell is like a series of holes that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. You can follow the path of the holes by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. This path can be drawn and mathematically explained. Once you have the math formula, you can change the rules and see how the animal's shell changes.",
            "It's been a decade since Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have changed much.  Even though the country is doing pretty well in achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals, like getting clean water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health is nowhere near what it needs to be to reach its targets by 2015.  In the next few sections, I'll be talking about the reasons behind this lack of improvement, and you'll see why Indonesia needs to focus on strengthening its healthcare system rather than just working on individual programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in getting skilled workers at births, with 72% of births now getting this kind of care.  But this number is a bit misleading since it includes traditional workers like midwives who can't provide medical help if a pregnancy gets complicated - which is why a lot of maternal deaths are due to hemorrhage.  Additionally, there's been a drop in the percentage of kids under five who get treated by a health professional for diarrhea, and the data on post-natal care is pretty incomplete, but it's clear that it's a big problem all over the country.\n\nC-section rates are still pretty low at 4%, and that's got some major implications.  The rate is 7% in cities, but only 2% in rural areas, which shows that healthcare services are mostly focused on city areas.  There's also a huge gap in access to healthcare between the richest and poorest families - 27% to be exact.  This means the poor are having a hard time getting the care they need, probably because they can't afford it.\n\nSo, the big question is how to make things better, starting with getting more healthcare services available.  Should Indonesia focus on developing special programs or just making the overall healthcare system stronger?  It's clear that special programs can get fast results, but they also have some big drawbacks.  One problem is that when you invest a lot in one area, other areas might get left behind.  Another issue is that all these separate programs can get really confusing and make a lot of extra paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate details and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  Two novels that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Instead of following the typical Victorian style, these novels incorporate a sense of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which helps to deepen our understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions. These atypical elements give us insight into their inner workings, making them feel more real and relatable.\n\nAs Fagin's character in Oliver Twist was walking between Sikes and Crackit, arguing, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was still there; the words they were saying echoed in his mind, and when he snapped out of it, he found himself talking to them.  Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire and was whisked away by an unseen force.  Through this disorienting experience, a nagging sense of pain lingered, wearing him down and tormenting him.\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests itself through dream sequences or dreamlike states.  In Oliver Twist, these bizarre events give us a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, revealing what hurts him and how he perceives the events unfolding around him.  When Oliver is shot in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if it's a dream, while struggling to find help.  The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over his situation, as well as his dire circumstances, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses, and he feels his despair wash over him again, this time laced with fear rather than surprise.  With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises as to who is responsible for his misfortune, since it certainly wasn't him.  This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his life, and that he's unable to even attempt to take charge of an event's outcome, even when his life is on the line.  A growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and lose his ability to react.\n\nThe day after the shooting passed quickly – it was over before it began – and night fell again, a long and dreadful silence that seemed to last forever, yet was over in what felt like an instant.",
            "A couple years back, I worked with a pretty cool after-school program where I helped Elementary school kids with their homework and whatever they were struggling with in class. My thing was reading and English, though. One of the instructors asked me to work with a little dude named Adrian, who was having a super tough time reading. I figured something was up; it was weird because he knew some letters super well, but others were a total mystery to him. I'm pretty sure he was of Latin background, and he spoke English like a pro, but I was still confused. We struggled through that until the day I met his mom. I was hanging out with him while the rest of the group went on a field trip, and his mom showed up. She only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish skills are basically non-existent, but we managed to communicate somehow. It hit me like a ton of bricks then: Adrian could totally read, but he just didn't know the English alphabet super well. I don't know if that realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing way better now.\n\nI'm telling this story because it highlights the problem of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as it seems, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can be super tough for them too. We all agree that this is a problem, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: just some extra tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciation. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of these things alone will fix it. We need to combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is actually a pretty great idea, not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. Apparently, kids in two-way bilingual education programs do way better in school. A lot of people freak out about this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we made this the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from it. So how do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's a bit unrealistic. What we could do is have special bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to help out.",
            "Most of us are told from a young age that there's something greater than us out there - something we can't fully comprehend. Some of us attend Sunday school, others go to Temple, and some search within themselves for answers. Many of us stick to the faith passed down by our parents, but some of us reject it entirely, thinking there's nothing beyond what we can see in our own little world. We might change our minds and try a different value system later on. Whatever path we choose, we're on a journey to figure out who we are based on our own unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us out of the dark and into the light.\n\nMy dad told me that cardinals are his favorite bird when I asked. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain pounding on the tin roof, the sound echoing off the wet plants by the edge of the porch. He was staring out into the rain, a look that was both searching and remembering. He'd lost a lot of weight lately, and his old clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair was thinner, too. I felt scared and alone, and I didn't know how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him without making it too real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nThat was the last time I saw my dad. He passed away in December, just five days before my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation hadn't made him feel better, but had kept him alive for a few more months longer than the doctors said he'd make it. I wondered what the point was in suffering so long if it didn't get any easier. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago. I didn't say any prayers that night because I didn't want to ask for anything. I just wanted to remember my dad the way he was, not the way he left.\n\nI didn't watch him die because I couldn't bear to see the person who made me leave this life behind. I wanted to remember him for who he was, not how he went. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. I curled up in a ball in bed for three days, waiting for the news. No one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a bit of an irony, an oxymoron combining \"old\" and \"new,\" as Ian Watt so cleverly points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. Throughout history, the Gothic mode has been praised and bashed, with some people thinking it's all superficial and others finding depth in its \"terrible sublime\" qualities (Burke). When Horace Walpole created the original \"Gothic Novel,\" The Castle of Otranto, he mixed elements from ancient romances and modern novels to invent a fresh way of writing. He called it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew inspiration from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, even though it was initially seen as old-fashioned or unsophisticated compared to the modern world. The blend of the theatrical and the new format of the novel, which lets readers see the characters' inner thoughts, is what made Gothic novels last and stay relevant, becoming both outdated and new to readers from different time periods.\n\nOne of the key Gothic ideas is the concept of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval idea of chivalry, which was meant to create a proper knight, was taken and transformed. Chivalry was important to Gothic writers because it represented the ideal knight – brave, honorable, and competent – and they saw a lack of those qualities in their own time. By using chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" was idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the future of Gothic to Romantic) and used to try to improve the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was living through a tumultuous time and was worried about the future. Feeling let down by politics and unfairly accused, he might have thought that the supposed good nature of people in the gothic era was lost in modern society. This idea is clear in characters like Frederic, who's described as:\n\nThe description of Frederic includes many chivalric images; he's a prince who's suffered, been affected by tragedy, and supposedly killed by infidels. This exaggerated portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" introduces the Gothic trope of excess, which will become a recurring theme (66).",
            "So, you want to know about supply chain management? It's basically the whole process of getting stuff from the person who wants it (the customer) all the way back to the raw materials that make it. It's like a big chain of events that happens really fast. The term supply chain management was invented by Keith Oliver back in 1982. He said it's all about planning, implementing, and controlling the whole process so you can satisfy customers quickly and efficiently. There are six main parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best customer service ever.\n\nProduction is the very first step in the process. It's like the foundation of the whole thing. You need to figure out when, why, where, and how you're going to make the stuff. To do that, you have to know what the customer wants, so you look at the market. The market is like a big indicator of what people are into. Once you know what they want, you can decide what to make and how much of it. After that, you figure out where to make it and which factory is best for quality and quantity. You also have to make sure the customer is happy, or else it's all pointless.\n\nThe next step is scheduling work and taking care of the equipment. This is super important because if you don't plan everything out, it can cost you a lot of time and money in the long run. I know this from my old job at Wal-Mart and Target. We had a super specific plan for everything, from how the uniforms looked to when the shipments came in. It made everything run smoothly and nobody got confused.\n\nThe second key element is supply. This is all about deciding what you're good at and who you should partner with. Let's say you make a bunch of different products and each one needs a different setup. You have to decide which one is best for each part of the process. You might even outsource some of the work to other companies to save time and money. The goal is to be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "I was walking down the street the other day and saw this crazy sign being held by Ellen Page, star of Juno. It read, \"Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\" I thought it was pretty wild. Burma, or Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia where the government is super strict. They took over in 1962 after a big power struggle. Last year, the people there started protesting, led by monks who wore these orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution, and at first, the government was kinda cool with it, but things quickly escalated into a full-blown conflict. The military started attacking the monks and their monasteries, and anyone who was seen as a threat was arrested or worse. Foreign journalists were even killed, like this Japanese dude named Kenji Nagai. We're not even sure how many people died, but some reports say thousands.\n\nThis isn't new, though. Governments have been trying to shut down dissent for ages. The ancient Romans thought their emperors were gods, and the Japanese still think their emperors are, like, actual gods. Our current president talks to some crazy dude named Ted Haggard, who's like, the leader of some super right-wing group. It's like, what's the difference between them and the Chinese government, which killed all these people in Tiananmen Square in '89? The official story says a few hundred died, but other reports say it was way more, like 2,000-3,000. And then there was the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia groups killed all these Tutsis and moderates. Hitler's whole \"Third Reich\" thing was pretty much the same deal.",
            "Duke Ellington’s impact on jazz is super big because he was around for so long and was so creative with his orchestra. Some of his songs, like the ones for this project, don't even have him on the piano, but as a composer, Ellington was a master at writing music that made each band member shine. He created this framework where soloists could just go wild and improvise, and at the same time, he'd write pieces that highlighted each band member's style. This way, he made the whole orchestra sound super cool and original. Ellington was also really good at understanding how each player sounded alone, and how they fit together in the group, which allowed him to write some of the most genius and amazing jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about how Ellington used voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in his whole career, and it's a good example of this in his song Creole Love Call. It's a slow, bluesy piece where he used voice to add some extra texture and color, without even needing lyrics. This song also shows how Ellington was great at making his soloists sound awesome, which he did in a lot of his music. The song has six different parts, and each one is like a mini-story. \n\nChorus 1: It starts with the voice and the reeds talking to each other, with the voice being super smooth and melodic at first, but then getting a bit rougher at the end.\nChorus 2: Then there's a muted trumpet solo that takes the basic melody and makes it sound even better, with some extra notes that make it sound really cool.\nChorus 3: After that, there's a clarinet solo that's super fast and high-pitched, with a piano phrase that's really funky.\nChorus 4: The next part is like a big echo of the first chorus, but with the brass and reed sections talking to each other.\nChorus 5: The final part is the most intense, with the reeds starting to talk back, and the brass section making some really cool rhythms.\nChorus 6: The last part goes back to the first chorus, but this time the voice is using a special technique called the \"growl\" to sound like it's playing an instrument.\nThe last part is just a quick tag with a vocal run and some weird, dissonant sounds from a trombone.\n\nThis is just one example of how Ellington used voice to add some extra flavor to his music. In his song Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill at making the orchestra sound tight with his ear for making sounds that sound really cool. In that song, he has a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, where they use both vocal and instrumental parts to make something really rich and cool. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) takes this idea even further, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone, and it sounds amazing.",
            "I've had this thing inside me for a while now - this feeling that something's missing. It started when I was 14, right when I was getting into the whole teenage scene. Now I'm 17, and it's still there. I've come to realize I'm looking for someone, not just something, but I just can't seem to find anyone I'm into. Some guys have tried to get my attention, and they've all gone through the usual awkward stages, but none of them have been able to hold my interest. I've spent years trying to figure out what's going on with this, and I've come up with a bunch of ideas, but nothing that really makes sense. So I just keep living life, still trying to figure it out.\n\nAt home, things are pretty chill. My parents are super laid-back and rarely argue about anything. The only times they do get into a fight are when they disagree with my independent streak. I'm the calm and collected daughter of two super mellow parents, but I'm like the complete opposite - I'm all about living life to the fullest and being true to myself. But today was different. I was walking around the house trying to find some new ideas, when I heard my mom let out a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. I ran in there, freaking out, and saw my mom on the ground, clearly in agony. She was saying \"Ow\" over and over, and I knew I had to act fast. I rushed to her side and helped her up. She told me to take her to the hospital - I could tell she was in a lot of pain. I got her to the car and drove her there myself.\n\nWhen we got to the hospital, the smell of disinfectant and sickness hit me, but I was too worried about my mom to feel scared. I helped her onto a rolling bed and called for the doctors. They took her in right away, and I was left sitting there, worried sick.\n\nApparently, my mom had slipped off a stool while trying to grab a vase from the top shelf. I was relieved when the doctors took her in and started checking her out. Now I'm just waiting and hoping everything turns out okay.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high score on the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\" scale, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet that consists of higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and monounsaturated fats, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are allowed.\n\nPast studies showed that following the Med diet was associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention study found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, these previous studies didn't focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study involved 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years old, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a research project following 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The authors calculated the aMed diet score six times from 1984 to 2004 using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that assessed participants' nutrient intake during the previous year. More than 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year study period. These questionnaires were validated through other studies. The researchers verified reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke by reviewing medical records, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records weren't available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the study, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. Age, smoking status, body mass index, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each questionnaire, and starting in 1986, the participants' leisure-time physical activity was also evaluated.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, the researchers averaged together the aMed scores from repeated questionnaires over time (averaging scores from two prior years). The study adjusted for potential \"confounders\" (factors that could affect the results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in the women. Over the course of 20 years, the researchers identified 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women who scored highest on the aMed diet were less likely to experience both CHD and stroke compared to those who scored lowest (with a relative risk of 0.71).",
            "So, let's talk about this super crazy financial crisis that hit the United States back in 2007. It was like, a total nightmare – unemployment went up, the housing market went down, and all these huge corporations were left in shambles. We're still dealing with the aftermath, so it's time to figure out what happened and how to stop it from happening again. In a nutshell, the financial crisis was caused by some pretty selfish and clueless politicians who pushed banks and companies to give out these sketchy sub-prime loans to people who couldn't really afford them. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to buy up and package these bad loans into these super complex financial things called CDOs and CDSs. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were like, \"uh-oh, we don't have enough money!\" and they tried to pawn off the problem onto these repackaged mortgages they'd already sold, and then onto the rest of the economy.\n\nIt all started back in 1999 when Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he relaxed some lending rules, which set the stage for this whole sub-prime mess that happened seven years later. Steven Holmes from the New York Times was like a total genius and predicted this whole thing would go down. He said, \"Hey, Fannie Mae is under pressure from the government to give out more loans to low-income people, and also from its stockholders who just want more profits.\" And then he nailed it: \"But if there's an economic downturn, Fannie Mae will be in big trouble and the government will have to bail it out, just like they did with the savings and loan industry in the 80s.\" Yeah, that's exactly what happened.\n\nA bunch of other factors contributed to the economy going haywire. There were all these new, super complicated mortgage things like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs that tied up the whole economy with the housing market. This made households and financial markets super vulnerable to even small changes in housing prices. And, well, the housing bubble burst, and all these financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were like, \"Oh no, what do we do?\" The top five investment banks were stuck with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which is like, a huge chunk of the USA's GDP. In the end, some of these banks got sold for a steal, while others got dismantled or forced to become \"normal\" banks with lots of rules to follow. Fannie and Freddie were in huge trouble too, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and the government had to step in and take control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - the villain of the writer's world.  It's that part in your story where you try to take off like a superhero, but end up face-planting into a pool of boring text that puts your readers to sleep or makes them vow to never come back to your site.  I know Dr. Merlin has been known to scream at her computer when she gets stuck in Exposition Limbo, and not in the cool, edgy way.\n\nExposition is the nemesis that every writer needs to conquer.  Even if you know the \"Show, don't tell\" rule, you're still likely to find yourself stuck in a sea of unnecessary details that don't move the plot forward.\n\nExposition is when you dump a ton of backstory, history, or info onto your readers without giving them a chance to breathe.  It's like the character in your story telling another character their entire life story in one breath - as seen in those epic tales like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's you, the author, doing the telling instead.\n\nTo illustrate this, imagine reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved at a certain time and place, gets married in style, and then has her husband brutally murdered in front of her.  You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to take two whole pages, right?  And you certainly wouldn't expect the husband and wife to only get two lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to spend some quality time developing the husband's character, showing how much he loves his wife through his words and actions, and revealing how she's changed and grown because of him.  This would make his death even more impactful and your connection to the heroine deeper.\n\nIn short, you'd want to add some meat to the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  As a writer, it's your job to provide that meat.  Sometimes it's tempting to rush through certain parts, but don't be tempted - give your readers what they want and need to care about your story.",
            "I just watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about some serious stuff in Ashley, Ohio - a dude named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. They only showed a quick bit on this, like two minutes, 'cause it was still developing. All they said was that he had stabbed her multiple times and got arrested. I think they handled it pretty fairly. \n\tNext up was a story about a shooting in Sharon Woods. Some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot, but they didn't have any suspects or arrests. The SWAT team was investigating. This story felt kinda short, and I think it might've been because the victim was a black kid from a black neighborhood. I've noticed this pattern before - when a minority gets hurt, the media usually doesn't give it much airtime. But if a white person gets hurt, it's huge news. \n\tThe next story was about a Med-Flight helicopter getting a .22 caliber bullet hole in it. They said they think it happened somewhere specific, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-grand reward for any tips that help catch the shooter. \n\tThen there was a story about some rain and thunderstorms coming on Saturday. They said the weekend was gonna be in the mid-to-low eighties, but it was a pretty short clip - I think they just wanted to keep us watching. \n\tThey also did a piece on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. They said the perp was a dark-skinned black guy wearing a hoodie, and they spent a weird amount of time emphasizing how dark he was. \n\tLastly, they had a story about Rene Rodriguez, a Texas dude who was convicted of running a big marijuana operation from Texas to Ohio. He got sentenced to 300 months in prison, which I thought was a weird way to say 25 years. They also mentioned he's Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant.",
            "There's a bond between brothers that's like a fortress, unbreakable and unshakable. It's a bond that holds a bunch of complicated emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. When you have a brother, you kinda get them, you know? They're like a mirror image of yourself, and they can only see themselves when they look at you. But it's when things get really tough that you find out what's really going on in that bond. It's then that you see the good and the bad, and it's not always easy to deal with. When you can look a brother in the eye and see your own reflection staring back at you, you're forced to confront who you really are and what you're really made of. It's in their actions and the consequences of those actions that you see what someone's really like. This theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis\", where two brothers are on a wild adventure that goes totally wrong. Their journey is like a rollercoaster of emotions, with bitter disappointment and intense pride clashing in the end. Only one of them gets out alive, but the other brother's spirit lives on.\n\nThe story is all about how one brother feels, especially about pride. He's got this huge ego and he wants his little brother, Doodle, to be someone he can teach all the cool stuff to, like how to hold his breath and run fast. But Doodle's got a weak heart, and it's like his whole dream is crushed. The big brother's got a mix of emotions, from anger to love, and it's hard to say which one's stronger. He even thinks about doing something crazy, but when Doodle smiles, he starts to feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It shows that deep down, he really loves his little bro. The story's all about how this complicated bond between brothers works, and how it can drive you crazy, but also how it can be super strong.",
            "So, the brain is basically a super cool, super advanced machine that can do all sorts of crazy stuff. As technology has gotten better and better, people have come up with new ways to describe how the brain works. At first, it was like a piece of wax, then a scroll, then a book, and now it's like a super powerful computer. However, these comparisons aren't perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong conclusions.\n\nSo, let's start with the basics. The brain takes in information from our senses, which turn things like touch, sound, and light into electrical signals. It then processes this info in two different ways: bottom-up and top-down. Think of bottom-up like putting together a puzzle – it starts with simple pieces of info like color, shape, and edges, and then puts them together to figure out what you're seeing. Top-down is like using what you already know to help you make sense of things faster. For example, if you see a picture of a black box on a white background, top-down processing can help you figure out it's a box, not a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed some info, it decides which signals are important and sends them to the right places. It's like having a filter that says, \"Hey, don't worry about those individual blades of grass, but let's pay attention to your name when someone says it really loudly.\" There are lots of steps to processing, and attention plays a big role in deciding what's important and what's not.\n\nBut before the brain can process info, it has to store it somehow. There are different kinds of memory, like short-term and long-term, and they work in different ways. When we first get info, it gets encoded, or put into the brain in a way that makes sense. This encoding depends on what kind of info it is – like how words look, sound, or mean. Once it's stored, the brain has to keep it around. Scientists think that short-term memory might be like a temporary electrical signal, while long-term memory is stored in special proteins.\n\nThere are all sorts of theories about how the brain organizes information. Some are based on how people remember things, some on computer science, and some on brain science. One cool theory is the semantic network, where ideas are connected to each other like a web. For example, the idea of a \"chair\" is linked to a \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of both technology and the capitalistic system that supports it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this world, people are conditioned to prioritize community and instant happiness above all else. The citizens are basically pawns in a larger game, forced to conform to the World Controller's ideology. By looking at the book through a Marxist lens, you can see that Huxley is basically saying that this is a bad idea. He uses words and ideas from Marxism, like homogeny and reification, to show that he thinks this system is messed up.\n\nThe way Huxley uses satire to criticize capitalism is pretty cool. He's talking about something called false consciousness, which is like when people don't know how they're really connected to the people around them, especially in terms of money. In Brave New World, people are so focused on their own stuff that they can't see the bigger picture. The World Controller is basically controlling everyone, making them think that all they need to do is consume and indulge in stuff. This is super obvious in how the lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are controlled through hypnopædia. They don't really have any control over their own lives. They're just following what they're told. This is basically an example of hegemony, which is when a group of people is controlled by a smaller group of people. The people in control are the ones who get to decide what's best for everyone else, and the lower classes just go along with it. They're basically buying into this system that's set up to keep them down.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are really superficial. People don't really care about each other, they just care about how they look and what they can get out of each other. It's like Huxley is saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and their ability to be themselves. Love and strong emotions don't exist in this world, and people are just going through the motions. The way the characters interact with each other is really shallow, like when the guys talk about the women just because of how they look, or when the women talk about their shallow relationships. This is all a commentary on how people are just following the rules and not really thinking for themselves. They're all just going along with what the system tells them to do, which is basically a Marxist idea about how the working class is brainwashed into thinking they're better than everyone else as long as they keep consuming and following the rules.",
            "I've been attending University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters, and navigating the campus can be a real pain. Like many others, I've had my share of struggles getting around. During my freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room, basically as far east as you can get on campus, except for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It would take me up to 25 minutes to get to places like Willard building near the center of campus on foot, especially when the weather was bad, which it often is in State College. I talked to an alum who's only a bit older than me, and they told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by huge empty spaces. Now those areas are filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, getting from one place to another is becoming more and more of a challenge. On a college campus, the best solution to this problem is the humble bicycle. But just having a bike isn't enough; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently talked to a friend who got back into biking after a few years off, and he said it's crazy he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for you, it's also super efficient. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergrads, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest move I made this year was buying a bike. Every day I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with my bike, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. There are some good things about walking too, but personally, I don't have time for it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take me an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week, which is just too much time to waste."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.

            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I pursue my education in social work, I'm set on a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to make a difference in the lives of abused or neglected kids, and to lend a helping hand to struggling families. Some key values that I'll bring to the social work field are service, respect, ethics, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional skills – staying on top of my game, so to speak. These aren't just important for social workers; they're personal values for me too.\n\nGrowing up, I always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to take. During high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and some dealing with issues in not-so-great ways. After witnessing some pretty tough stuff, I decided to go for a degree in Psychology. Still unsure about my next step, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old kid who was really struggling – he'd run away from his abusive parents. The next day, he called the cops on them. I went to their house, where I told the police about my concerns and shared that I had a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. They asked me to speak with the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I talked to the parents, they seemed really nervous and made excuses for their kid's actions. After that, I seriously considered a career in social work to help kids deal with family drama.\n\nSocial justice is another value that's super important in the social work field. We say that individuals matter, but in reality, we're often more about conforming to old traditions than being unique. If we're all about mourning lost individuals, then why do we try to be like everyone else? I'm an individual and I don't want to put limits on myself to fit in with the crowd. In high school and college, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could – I colored my hair weird colors, wore clothes that fit my personality, got my ears pierced in a more alternative way, joined GSBA, and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fighting against it.",
            "The following study delves into the biological and sociocultural models associated with insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic factors that are passed down through generations as well as the medical aspects of overall health. On the other hand, the sociocultural model looks at how environmental factors, such as ethnicity, demographics, socioeconomic status, and more, contribute to the disorder. This paper will explore and examine the various pieces of research related to these models in order to better grasp their intricacies. An analysis of the research findings and their strengths and weaknesses will be presented in this review.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three distinct groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders connected to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental health issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssonmias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining a restful sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by an excessive desire to stay awake, both lasting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. \n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genetic factors, heritable traits, and the physiological aspects of sleep. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, as discovered by Matsuki et al. (2009). This study implies that findings from animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This has significant sociocultural implications, as the phenotype could be inherited, regulating sleep, and any alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep patterns for an individual. This, in turn, could impact daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This paper explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain handles what we hear. Put simply, people with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain can't properly sort out what's going on. I mean, imagine trying to have a conversation at a loud party - it's hard to focus on what one person is saying when there's a lot of background noise, right? That's kinda what's happening with CAPD. It's not that they can't hear, it's just that their brain can't separate the good stuff from the noise. \n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first started studying kids with communication problems. They called it \"auditory imperception\" back then, but now we know it as CAPD. A team of Italian researchers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, actually started developing tests for CAPD back in 1954. Later, in 1961, Kimura came up with a model that explained how the brain handles different sounds, and it's been a topic of study ever since.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like? Well, it can manifest in all sorts of ways. Some people might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from, or they might get confused by different sounds happening at the same time. They might struggle to recognize patterns or changes in speech, like when someone says something sarcastically. It's like their brain gets all mixed up and can't untangle what's going on. And if you're trying to listen to two people talking at the same time, it can be super hard for them to block out one sound and focus on the other.\n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors and other specialists use a bunch of different tests. They might ask questions and observe how people respond to different sounds, like a bunch of words or numbers all at once. It's not like there's one magic test that can diagnose it, but it's all about getting a sense of how the brain handles sound. Some tests even use fancy equipment to record sounds and see how the brain responds. And, at the end of the day, there's no known cause for CAPD, so it's all about figuring out the best way to help people deal with it.\n\nTeachers in mainstream classrooms can help out by being aware of these common \"red flags\" - you know, the signs that might indicate someone has CAPD. They can use special techniques to make it easier for students with CAPD to focus and understand what's going on. By being understanding and accommodating, teachers can make a big difference in the lives of students with CAPD.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that disguises can be pretty useful for getting away with huge deceptions for a long time, but in the end, you gotta ditch that new disguise or risk losing yourself in the process forever. The thing is, getting rid of that deception can also make you pretty alienated from others, since some people might not take it well. You're basically stuck between saving yourself or keeping your relationships with the people around you. While some will be all chill about it, others will freak out and be totally turned off by the whole thing. \n\nThe part about disguising yourself as the opposite gender gets really tricky because it brings up a bunch of other issues. Like, why do people do it in the first place? In Viola's case, she pretends to be a dude so she can protect herself from people trying to hurt her. She's a bit like, \"Hey, I'll just go to this captain and he'll help me hide out near Count Orsino so I can serve him.\" (She's talking about her plan at the beginning of Act 5, Scene 1.)\n\nSo, Viola dresses up as a guy and it works, but it also makes her lose touch with the women around her and makes her miss out on a support system. And to make matters worse, she's so good at pretending to be a dude that Olivia gets all confused and starts thinking she's a guy named Sebastian and falls for her. Then there's the whole thing with Viola and Orsino, who's all like, \"You've told me a million times you wouldn't love a woman like me.\" (Act 5, Scene 1, again.)\n\nBut, looking at it from today's perspective, Twelfth Night can be seen as a way to show how deception can help people figure out things they've been hiding, especially for Olivia and Orsino. There are some parts that seem to hint that Olivia might be secretly into women, but I guess that's not really what it's about. Olivia's more likely just making fun of people who judge others based on looks. It's pretty clear when she starts to really like Sebastian and forgets all about Cesario/Viola. It's like she says, \"You're like a sister to me.\" (Act 5, Scene 1.) It sounds like Olivia is just messing with people who judge based on appearance.",
            "You can't even begin to understand the real deal about German colonial rule. I mean, yeah, it was super brutal, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa. But you can't just lump the whole empire into one neat little package. It was all over the place with different policies and styles in every colony, just like how it varied in geography. Education was no exception - some colonies were actually doing pretty well, like German East Africa (now Tanganyika) where the Brits found a bunch of super smart and literate Africans in 1919. They were even giving German colonial efforts in Kamerun and other places a thumbs up from authors back in the day.\n\nBut then there's South West Africa (now Namibia), where things were super different. Unlike East Africa where the government was all about setting up schools and educating the locals, in South West Africa they basically left it all to the missionaries who were getting pretty minimal support from the government. Yet, they still managed to throw a ton of resources at educating Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and regulating the missionaries. This all had some major long-term effects on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies were rocking with educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa \"most people were basically clueless, uneducated, and illiterate.\" There were a bunch of reasons for this, and I want to dive deeper into them in this paper, especially the attitudes of settlers and colonial officials towards the locals.\n\nThere's a bunch of research out there on education in the German colonies, but most of it is in German and from the early 20th century. These early works were all about describing the educational systems in these colonies. Later stuff in English expanded on it by comparing education in different colonies and getting into the nitty-gritty of specific aspects. It turns out that every colony was doing its own thing with education, and the most famous work on this topic is probably Cohen's study of South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the two and talks about the factors that made them so different. Apparently, the big settler population in South West Africa is a major reason for the difference.\n\nSouth West Africa was pretty chill for Europeans, with a relatively nice climate, but most of the land was basically a desert. This made it super appealing to Europeans, and by 1913 there were almost 15,000 of them living there, which was way more than in any other colony except East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music has undergone a huge transformation over the past 100 years, expanding into so many different genres that it's a real challenge to make a list of them all. To make matters even more complicated, most of these genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres within their own domains. I'm gonna argue that the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most expressive and diverse genres of popular music in the last 40 years. It's expressive because it showcases a wide range of emotions, mostly on the darker side of the spectrum, but also because it's incredibly flexible, allowing people to take it in their own unique direction. \n\nYou could say we've reached a point in the heavy metal movement where it's hard to pinpoint what exactly heavy metal is, given how many niches and sub-niches it's branched out into by incorporating elements from other genres. But to truly understand the metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta understand the metal movement itself and where it all started. It's actually defined by darkness, heavy metal being the \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatrics. It's about musicians who really know their craft, and that skill shines through in the music. Some say metal is also a movement heavily influenced by psychedelics, which were all the rage in the 70s, and were used as a creative outlet for musicians to tap into their wilder side. This music often deals with the darker aspects of life, which was a new and exciting thing back in the day when most popular music was pretty laid-back. Some later metal bands even took a cue from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Some lyrics that showcase the darker side of metal include the following from Helter Skelter, which is like a showcase of the Beatles' wilder side. This song is actually considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs, as a response to a similar song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they added this song to The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealists were painting their trippy works, Henri Rousseau was busy living his own dream, literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, isn't just some chick checking out the sights in a fantasy world – it's also a reflection of his own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. For years, Rousseau wanted the art world to give him a shout-out, and he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, he wanted to fit in with the cool art kids and follow the latest styles, but on the other hand, he wanted to be true to himself and paint his own way.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's backstory. He was born on May 21, 1844, in some small town in northwest France. His dad was a hardware dealer who was pretty well-off, but Rousseau didn't get any fancy art training. Instead, he worked for the French government as a toll collector until he was 40. People called him a customs inspector, but that's not exactly what he was. After his first wife and eight little kids died, Rousseau was left with just one kid, Julia, and a whole lot of sadness. Painting was his escape, his way to start fresh. Unlike some other artists of his time, Rousseau wasn't all about painting pretty peasants; he was a folk painter, and his art was all about regular people's hopes and dreams.\n\nIt's no wonder Rousseau wanted the art world to like him. I mean, he was basically starting from scratch, and he was doing it at an older age than most artists. Plus, he was competing with some super talented and famous artists. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was getting famous that Rousseau started getting recognition for his work. In his book, Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says that Rousseau and Matisse were like total opposites. Matisse was all about not being boring, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would accept him as a real artist.",
            "A lot of deep thinkers have suggested that ethics and aesthetics are close friends - that truth and beauty are connected in some way. I think there's a reason for this that goes all the way down to the basics. As John Keats says in his poem, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we learn in life comes from school or personal experience, but we tend to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing to be taught. Ethics and aesthetics are both about trying to figure out why something is beautiful or moral, as opposed to providing a set of rules for creating good art or good behavior. \n\nTo get to the point, people can never really put their finger on exactly what makes something good or beautiful. Talking about the value of something like the Mona Lisa might involve stuff like background, foreground, or cultural context, but these things don't capture what makes it good art. When people talk about their favorite piece of art, they often say something like \"There's just something about it\" before getting into the details. I think that both art and morals have this thing that can't be totally explained. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how well we describe a work of art, there's always something more to it. I think morality has the same property. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think this \"something\" that's hard to put into words is what makes art and morality so powerful, and it's what connects them.\n\nI believe that morals and art are connected because we experience them at a deep, almost unexplainable level. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a country that's really come together, with its own unique vibe that's all over the place - from the mountains in München to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You can feel that culture in Köln, right on the Rhine River, all the way to Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise it's got such a cool culture considering it's made up of lots of different tribes and sources. They call it Germania, the land of the Germans, but nobody really knows where the name came from. Some think it's from a tribe called the Tungrians, and they were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (check out Tacitus, 98).\n\nJulius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his book about the Gallic Wars, which was all about beating up the Gauls and dealing with Germanic tribes that were always crossing the Rhine. He got the word from the Gauls themselves and used it to tell the difference between people he'd already conquered and those he hadn't. He even wrote about how the Germans were always at war with the Gauls in his book. Some people think the name comes from a spear they used in battles called a ger, or maybe from the Old Irish word \"garim\", which means they were super loud or rowdy. \n\nIn his book, written in 98 AD, Tacitus said that the Germans were basically a pure-blooded people who didn't mix with other cultures. He even wrote about how nobody would just leave Asia or Africa to come to Germany, which was pretty rough and wild. So, the Romans didn't really want to live there, but they did go there to trade and fight sometimes. Germanic tribes started showing up in the first century, and they'd trade goods and skills with the Romans, who mostly just went home after their campaigns.",
            "My eyes were fixed on something in front of me, but my mind was elsewhere, blank and unresponsive.  I went through the motions, staring at this thing, but it was like my brain was in a different room, studying it without really thinking about it.  Thoughts would pop up for a second, and then they'd be gone, like a fleeting thought that never really stuck.  It was like I was just going through the motions, not really thinking for myself, just experiencing whatever I was looking at.\n\nI'd picked up this art book a while back, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, after an artist I worked with suggested it.  I'd always wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book was supposed to teach me the basics.  One trick it showed was to draw a square around whatever picture you're looking at, to simplify it and make it easier to understand.  I tried to do that, but at the time, I was so blown away by what I was looking at that I couldn't even think about drawing a frame around it.\n\nI was staring at this bowl of fruit, and all I could do was stand there, frozen in awe.  I thought about all the famous artists who'd done their own weird things with art - Picasso and his blue phase, Monet and his love of greenery, the Renaissance masters and their colorful stuff.  If I wanted to be an artist, then this was my chance to start something new, to make my own art.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand reached out and picked up my pencil, and for a second, I felt like I was creating something amazing.  But then I had to go use the bathroom, and that's when things started to go wrong.  I tried to, ah, \"create\" something in the toilet, but it just wouldn't budge.  I was getting a little anxious, and my hand was starting to shake.  I looked at the, um, \"art\" I was trying to create, and I just couldn't help but frown.  It was a real mess.\n\nI gripped the mop a little tighter, and I thought about how I was going to have to deal with this later.  I was already feeling pretty stressed out, and now I had to add this to the list.  I looked at the, ahem, \"masterpiece\" in front of me and just shook my head.  It was gonna be a long day...",
            "Teen drivers are a major cause of concern in the US.  Several factors contribute to this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say that one reason is that the teen brain is not ready to handle the risks of driving.  Teens also lack experience, which leads to more fatal accidents, a higher rate of rollover incidents, speeding, and driving off the road.  When teens drive with their friends, the danger increases even more.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the number of traffic accidents goes up as the age of the passenger gets younger.\n\nIn an attempt to make driving safer for teens, some states require temporary licenses that limit the number of hours they can drive and don't allow minors as passengers.  However, these licenses are only temporary fixes.  The real issue is that teens are, statistically, not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Marvin Zuckerman, a psychologist, thinks that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license.  He's done research showing that people under 19-20 often take risks just for the thrill of it.  This makes sense, so it's a good idea to delay driving until the tendency to take risks has decreased.  If we keep giving out driver's licenses to young teens, we'll see more deadly accidents and the death toll will probably get really high.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road.\n\nMaking new laws to deal with this issue would be pretty simple.  Schools could still offer driver's education classes to teach future drivers the basics, but no one under 18 could drive.  We could still give out temporary permits before a full license, and require a certain number of driving practice hours.  The number of hours could be the same as most states require now (like 6 hours of driving lessons and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California).  Since this problem affects all states, a national law would be a good way to protect teen drivers across the country.  This idea isn't new, but it could really make a difference.",
            "I spent the day browsing through the early Edison films at the Library of Congress and decided to check out all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and they're all about using editing tricks to create illusions. I mainly analyzed the poetic aspects of these films and looked at how some of the later ones broke the rules. Back in the day, trick films were pretty set in their ways - they were static, stuck to a frontal proscenium, used long shots, and just one shot per film. It was like a one-trick pony, you know? But around the turn of the century, some films started to get a little wild and crazy and added in some new stuff like multiple shots.\n\nWhat really stood out to me about these trick films was that they were all shot on interior sets with a proscenium in the background. The camera never moved, no matter what. It was like it was stuck in one place, just like in a play or a magic show. I guess this is where the idea of a static set comes from - it's like a trapped stage. When I watched Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), I noticed that the actors would just move side to side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Even when they left the frame, the camera didn't budge. It was like they were stuck in some kind of weird, two-dimensional world.\n\nThese early trick films also stuck to long shots and occasional medium shots. Never any close-ups, just like in a play where the audience sees the whole scene at once. It's like the camera is trying to show you the whole performance at once, like a big ol' play. And the actors never move towards the camera, so you never get any close-ups. It's like they're stuck in some kind of frozen moment in time.\n\nMost of these early trick films are super short, like, under a minute, and they're all about doing one trick and getting out. It's like a magic show, where they just do a few tricks and then it's over. But, when you look closer, you realize that some of these films are actually made up of several short shots joined together to create some crazy illusion. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example - it looks like one shot, but if you really pay attention, you can see where the actual camera cuts happen.",
            "So there's this guy John Taylor from Caroline, and he was super into Republicanism from the get-go. He was a farmer at heart, but even with his farming and his brief stint in politics, he was known for being super outspoken about personal freedom and the government. His love for agriculture basically dictated his views on almost everything, including the government, sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system. He was all about preserving and promoting the best of the best when it came to careers, which influenced his arguments on just about everything.\n\nTaylor thought the US had a shot at creating the perfect system because they didn't have any pre-existing traditions to mess things up - it was a blank slate, basically. He was all about natural rights and how they're all connected - if one gets taken away, they all suffer, and the ones that are left are basically worthless. He believed these rights should be off-limits to the government. He thought the so-called \"state of nature\" was all about people with power and bad intentions getting ahead, but that shouldn't be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo make this ideal society a reality, Taylor believed a government had to be designed with both good and evil in mind. He was pretty rigid in his views on dualistic morality - he thought government is basically just a reflection of human nature. He said that governments have good and bad principles, and good principles are all about protecting private property, improving agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He thought a government with good principles would be fair no matter who was in charge, but the reality is that governments are usually run by greedy people. He believed self-interest was the driving force behind everything humans do, but it's only bad when it leads to a society that exploits others. A good government is necessary to keep humans' natural badness in check, but it needs to be watched closely to avoid adding any bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of other super-hardcore Republicans back then, was all about interpreting the Constitution super strictly. He wanted a super limited Federal government that only had the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew a big Federal government would be expensive and likely to become a dictatorship, but he also thought that just following the literal words of the Constitution without considering the writers' intentions could be super corrupt. And, to him, the Declaration of Independence was basically the US's true charter because it clearly states that we're a bunch of separate states rather than one country.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, it's clear that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was pretty discouraging, and it's hard to say exactly why it happened. One thing that might have contributed to it is that winter set in at our New England campus, which probably led to fewer people biking or walking to school. It's also possible that the end of the fall semester and the holiday season just got in the way – everyone was too busy finishing schoolwork and grades to bother filling out the log. Plus, the month-long break at the end of the semester probably meant a lot of people didn't need to come to campus at all. When classes resumed in January, we saw another low number of submissions, but that still doesn't explain the dip in February. It could be that people just got bored with the project after the initial excitement wore off. To counteract this, we tried something called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which actually worked and boosted log submissions for that month. We figured out that one of our biggest challenges was getting people to stay engaged despite the natural decrease in interest, and also dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that are just part of higher education. \n\nAnother problem we faced was that a lot of people really love driving their cars, and that's just a big part of our culture. So we had to come up with incentives to get people to try alternative modes of transportation. We gave out some pretty cool prizes, like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, would have made a difference – but unfortunately, we didn't get to try that out. We kept the same type of prizes throughout the project, but if we had announced some bigger prizes in December or January, it might have kept people engaged instead of losing interest. I mean, who wouldn't want to win a bike or a car?",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is pretty cool because it's like a security that copies an index, a commodity, or a bunch of assets, just like an index fund, but it's way more flexible and trades like a stock on the exchange.  It gives you the benefits of an index fund, like diversification, and the perks of owning a single stock, like being able to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase just one share at a time.  These benefits are super attractive, but the fees for ETFs are way lower than the average mutual fund.  However, there are some downsides, like you have to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just like with a stock order.  Another awesome thing about ETFs is that there's a huge variety of funds available.  But, it's always smart to be a savvy financial investor and check if the benefits you're told about, like diversification, are actually real, and how real they are.  For now, we're going to check out the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is just as good as owning a bunch of individual stocks.  \n\nTo make things less overwhelming, we're only going to look at the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  The top 10 holdings are listed below, along with their percentage of the total assets.\n\nBy looking at how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets to calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF has them.  The calculations for Beta and Return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's pretty clear that a portfolio made up of just the top 10 holdings would return 6.11% more than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It's also pretty evident that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  So far, it seems like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a higher return with a lower Beta.  But, there's a chance that the means of these two portfolios might not be all that different statistically.\n\nTo figure out if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compared it to the standard deviation of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-Land is often considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's improved poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott thinks is linked back to the writings of Virgil. However, it's also possible that Poe got it from a more recent source - he was a big fan of German authors. \n\nThis connection is pretty significant because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt noticed in his book that Poe's poem Politian is similar to Goethe's Mignon, which led him to believe that Poe might have been inspired by Goethe. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says that Goethe was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust, which came out in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year he died. There's a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\" hidden inside the second part of Faust. It's about a king who loses his wife and starts drinking heavily, then decides to die after remembering his dead queen. He throws away his goblet and walks to a cliff, where he dies. The King of Thulé and the character in Dream-Land have some pretty strong similarities, maybe even a dark opposite of Poe's own struggles with loss and drinking. \n\nFaust was also turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe mentions Thule twice in his collected works - once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" to bookend the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place with dead friends and a world without color. This sounds a lot like the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem, who's just lost his wife and is feeling pretty down. It's like the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" stepped right into Goethe's poem. \n\nGoethe was a pretty big deal in the literary world, and Poe would have likely known about him, even if it was just through his respect for Tennyson. Poe said something about how he admired Tennyson, and he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through all the reproductions that were going on after the original publication.",
            "In California, if a customer slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store and got hurt, can they get punitive damages if the store manager knew about the spill but didn't clean it up for half an hour because he was too busy eating dinner? A judge's probably not gonna dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages right away. To win their case, the customer needs to show that the manager acted with a super bad and on purpose disregard for how his actions would affect people, and that his actions were really, really bad. The customer can argue that the manager should've known how bad it would be not to clean up the spill because lots of other people had slipped and gotten hurt in the store before, and he still did nothing. The customer's argument that the manager's actions were super bad isn't super strong, but it's still kind of reasonable. This is because the store had six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager didn't do anything to make the store safer.\n\nOn October 13th at 5:00 pm, an employee of D&D Markets told the manager, Paul Martin, that there was a big applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin was like, \"I'm on dinner break, I don't have time for customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee told Martin about the spill again, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back really badly. Before Palmer got hurt, there were already five other slip-and-fall incidents reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for both regular damages and punitive damages, and we're figuring out whether to ask the judge to throw out the part of the claim about the punitive damages.\n\nIn California, people can get punitive damages if someone broke a law that wasn't related to a contract and acted with a really bad attitude, like being super mean or deceitful. The law says \"malice\" means either doing something on purpose to hurt someone, or doing something really, really bad with a total disregard for other people's rights or safety. Courts have said that it's like when someone knows that their actions are going to hurt people, but they do it anyway because they don't care. That's basically what the teacher in the Taylor case said in 1979.",
            "It's crazy to think it's been almost four years since I took that course on Islam at CBC.  We had this huge debate in class about whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I still think that question is super relevant today, especially considering how media's view on Islam has changed since 9/11.  It's wild to think that back in 2001, we wouldn't have even considered a presidential candidate with a Muslim background like Barack Obama.  \n\nThe Prophet's biography really got me thinking.  I learned in class that Muhammad was supposed to be some kind of conqueror who forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a whole different picture.  It's like, Muhammad comes across as this humble guy who's been misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  People started to see the 'truth' in his teachings and came to him on their own.  That's pretty different from what I thought I knew about him.\n\nWhat's also tripping me out is how similar the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's 'miracles' are.  Like, there's this one story where Muhammad takes some mutton and milk and it's enough for 40 people.  I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like this humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, just lived in truth and did miracles.  That's kinda problematic because it downplays Jesus' life and personhood.  It's like they're stealing from Jesus and trying to pass it off as Muhammad's story.\n\nThere are a lot of stories in the biography that are presented as 'proof' of people converting to Islam on their own, but they're all from third-party sources.  I mean, it's like the author's trying to say 'Hey, I heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so,' and it just doesn't feel real.  It makes me skeptical.\n\nWhat really gets me is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this godly, humble, and wise guy.  But history doesn't back that up, and I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Looking back, it seems that the teachings and ideas that Jesus lived by got lost in the shuffle when Christianity started evolving after his death.  If we look at Christian history in general, it's clear that it's strayed further and further away from its roots.  It's like the whole world is moving forward with a growing awareness and a trend towards progress, but the traditional folks are still stuck in their ways and resistant to new ideas.  They might not be influential enough to make a huge impact, though.  I think down the line, people will start to become more aware of their Christian history and wonder what the original plans were.  They'll start to figure out which parts of the religion were added over time and what the actual message of Jesus was.  It might take a while - decades or even centuries - but eventually, things will swing back around.  A big shift will happen in Christian history, and we'll move back to the way things were when Jesus first started spreading the word.  Instead of all these added layers of doctrine, we'll strip them away, one by one, until we're back to the basics of what Jesus taught us about God.  When this movement picks up speed in the US and Europe, it'll be like a big wave that sweeps through and changes things.  People will start to worship like we did back in Jesus' day, following what he said and believed.  The church as an institution will stay strong, but it'll lead people back to the basics, not the complicated ideas that have been added over time.  You'll see a big change from all the differences within Christianity to tons of similarities and a more uniform way of thinking.  It's not the first time this has happened, either - think about how the Roman Empire used to persecute Christians, but then they became the Christian empire, or how the US used to have African-American leaders at the bottom of society, but now they're leading the way.  A similar thing is going to happen in Christianity, where people will go back to the source and make things simpler and more unified.  To make all this happen, we need to start seeing Jesus' words as metaphors, not as literal statements.  So, let's go back to the beginning - what was Christianity like back in the day?  If we go way back, we find that it all started with Judaism, which was the core of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Jewish people already believed in one God, had a revealed religion, and followed the Hebrew scriptures.  But they weren't all on the same page - there were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a bunch of regular folks, all with different ideas.",
            "I think that The Jungle really shows how humans on the inside are pretty selfish and only think about themselves. They just try to make their lives better and don't really care about anyone else. This is super clear in the book when you look at the big factory owners and managers. All they care about is making their companies huge and rich and they don't even think about the people or the planet getting hurt because of it. Upton Sinclair writes some pretty sick stuff, like, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's basically painting a picture of how messed up the pollution is and how the owners don't even care about the animals or people getting hurt. They're all about making a buck, and don't care if it hurts the environment or the people working for them. Sinclair says it pretty bluntly, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". The owners and managers are all about making money, and they'll do whatever it takes to get it. They make people work crazy hours and then just get rid of them when they're not making enough money. Back then, there weren't really any laws to protect workers, so the owners could do whatever they wanted. The people working in the factories and living in Packingtown were basically treated like slaves. There were no organizations helping them or giving them information, and the unions were actually just making money off the poor workers. The workers were basically trapped in this system and were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Sometimes authors really know how to get you to feel a certain way about important stuff. They have a bunch of tricks up their sleeve to do this, and some of them work way better than others. In his book The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald is like a master of these tricks. One of the things he does is pair up words that don't usually go together to make you think about a subject in a certain way. Another thing he does is take a symbol and give it meaning, then use it again to make you feel something specific. Fitzgerald used this last trick with lots of colors, including gold, green, but also white/gray and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for white/gray and red/pink, then uses that meaning to make you feel a certain way about something important.\n\nFitzgerald makes white/gray into a symbol of something pretty specific: uniformity. White is like, higher class and nicer, while gray is more old and faded. He sets up this meaning at the very beginning of the book by using these colors all the time. Like, Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white, and not just them - everyone's always wearing white: Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is super pale and white. Actually, the only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick's describing Gatsby's party: the halls are all gaudy and bright. Fitzgerald keeps using these colors to describe regular, boring stuff too: as Nick goes to work, he goes down the white canyons of lower New York, the names of people at Gatsby's parties are just gray names on Nick's schedule, Catherine's apartment is just one part of a long row of white apartment buildings, and so on. He even describes plain people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a white girlhood together, there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes, the little Italian kid in the train is gray, and the dog-seller is a gray old man.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald builds up enough meaning with white/gray, he uses them to make you feel like some subjects are unimportant or uniform. This starts with Daisy. After a while without using these colors much, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as wearing white in a little white roadster, and you start to see her as just a uniform thing, something Gatsby wants but isn't really a person. He uses this technique with Daisy a bunch of times to make you feel like she's just a uniform addition, like when there's a gray haze around her fur collar, or when she's wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's big encounter.",
            "San Diego County is super good at growing food, thanks to its awesome weather and lots of sunshine. They grow all sorts of cool stuff like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and even tree fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries and honey are also super popular, and people love getting peppers. There's a huge demand for organic food in the area, and lots of local groups have super long waiting lists for their community-supported agriculture programs. People in San Diego also love buying organic eggs and milk. Many organic farms in the area even let you tour their operations and explore the land for hiking, birdwatching, and other fun stuff. This kind of setup is perfect for farmers who want to get government help while keeping the land healthy and making money through tours and other programs.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming are pretty sweet, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. For one, it takes a lot more work and management to get rid of pests and weeds without using chemicals, and you might lose more crops than with regular farming methods. Small organic farms also can't compete with big operations when it comes to efficiency. To make things better for wildlife, you've got to do things like plant cover crops, help animals move around the land, get rid of invasive species, and make sure the plants have the right conditions to thrive. That's a lot more work and costs more money, so farmers might need some help or expertise to make it all work.\n\nI picked a specific piece of land near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, as my example. It's 160 acres of beautiful chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland, right next to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is covered in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan looks at over a hundred different plants and animals, some of which are super endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are in trouble and might be listed as endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land has been home to Native Americans for who-knows-how-long and was later settled by cattle ranchers and people who sold wood in the 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing and wood production for a long time. I picked a real piece of property from a website and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might do to make organic farming work and keep the land safe for wildlife. I used a local organic farm in the same area as my example.",
            "Culture is a key factor in any negotiation, but it's often more about what it's not than what it actually is. It's not one-size-fits-all; instead, it's a complex and multifaceted thing that can change from situation to situation. You can't make blanket statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" because they're just too broad and oversimplify things. What's more helpful is understanding how a culture affects the negotiation at hand and how its attitudes might impact the talks. When you deal with a foreign culture, you're bound to compare it to your own, and that's when the real learning happens.\n\nTo get a handle on a different culture, you might need to study its history or learn about its prejudices. The goal is to accept it for what it is, not to judge or try to change it, especially when you're in a weaker bargaining position. If you're negotiating on foreign soil, showing respect for local traditions and customs can be a game-changer. It can help you get past any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nBut culture isn't just about national or international differences; it's also present within companies, too. Corporate culture can vary wildly depending on the company, from super-serious work hours to a more relaxed schedule. You can see evidence of it in things like dress codes, communication styles, and who gets hired. Take American companies, for example - they're all different, even within the same country. And it's not just about big differences between companies; even within the same company, there can be regional and urban/suburban differences. So, it's not always easy to tell what's going on beneath the surface.\n\nWhen it comes to values, that's where things get really important. They're what give a culture its underlying reasons for being. If saving face or community harmony is a big deal in a culture, you can bet that a negotiator won't go out of their way to shame their company or boss in public. And if a culture values getting a hard bargain, they won't be in a rush to settle just to get a deal done. Knowing these things can help you prepare for a negotiation, but it's also a good idea to get to know your opponent on a personal level to really make the negotiation work.",
            "\"The fool has said, 'There is no God.' This quote from Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible is also the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on God's existence and is found in the beginning of his reasoning. It's interesting to note that Thomas Aquinas seems to hold a similar view as well. Since we're about to discuss both of their arguments, which are basically about the same thing, we'll assume they're both right about the existence of God - the God of the Bible. If we consider a different version of God, it would be hard to compare their arguments because they're more or less just trying to prove the existence of the one in the Bible. I think what I'm getting at is that while both of them make some solid points, neither one really does a complete job of proving God's existence.\n\nLet's take a look at St. Anselm's argument first. Anselm basically says that to find out about God, you can look inside yourself. He says that because we already know God exists in our minds, it's impossible to imagine a world without him. When you break it down, he's saying that you don't need any outside evidence to prove God's existence - it's all about what you already know inside your head. This idea is often called faith, which means accepting something without all the facts. It's a pretty different approach from what St. Thomas Aquinas is saying.\n\nSt. Thomas thinks that you can use logic and evidence to prove God's existence without relying on faith. This would be super helpful for spreading Christianity because it would make it easier to convince new people to join without them having to believe something without proof. He's got five different logical arguments to back this up: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. What he's basically saying is that you can use logic to figure out that God exists, even if you can't see him. For example, imagine if someone told you that you're missing a puzzle piece, and you put all the others together - you can still figure out what the missing piece looks like without actually seeing it.",
            "It's a pretty weird feeling thinking that around 2,500 years ago or so, a prince would grow up to become the Buddha. I guess this guy would ditch the whole royalty thing and find enlightenment, which, in turn, led to the creation of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. I'm pretty sure it's changed a lot since the Buddha's time, though. You can see the difference in a place like Sri Lanka, where they have this wacky water-cutting ceremony. Everyone, monks and regular people alike, participate in it, and it's got some meaning, even though the Buddha never talked about it. These differences are all over the place, from the silly traditions to the deeper stuff that makes up the core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to modify its main ideas over time, both on its own and due to external influences. Sometimes these changes come from people who don't believe in Buddhism, but other times they come from within the community itself.\n\nYou might hear some new terms in this discussion, so let's define them. An internal force refers to something that comes from within the Buddhist community, while an external force is something from outside. A hostile force is anything that harms the Buddhist community, while a benign force doesn't try to hurt or help, even if it ends up doing one or the other by accident. These terms will pop up a lot in what I'm about to say.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the basics of Theravada Buddhism – the core stuff that makes it tick. Buddhists put their trust in three key things: the Buddha, the Dhamma (which is essentially all the Buddhist texts), and the Sangha (the community). The Dhamma is made up of three main parts – the Tripitaka – which includes the Sutta Pitaka (all the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (the rules of conduct), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the metaphysical stuff). The metaphysical stuff covers ideas like there's no permanent soul, life is full of suffering, and nothing lasts forever. If you can wrap your head around these concepts, you can break free from this cycle of death and rebirth. Along with that, you'll also kick the habit of desiring stuff, hating things, and being delusional. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for life, with five precepts for regular people (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't be all weird about sex, and don't get drunk) and a bunch more rules for monks. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, life is suffering; second, attachments cause suffering; and third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico have a pretty wild history that dates back to 1836 and lasted 57 years, from then to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p.145).  The craziest part of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US took down Mexico and got its hands on Texas and the American Southwest.  There were other smaller skirmishes between the two nations, but the fighting finally died down just before the First World War.  It all started because Americans and Mexicans had major disagreements about stuff like religion, culture, and stuff they thought was important, and they also had huge differences over what they wanted to gain. (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  \n\nThis rivalry thing isn't unique to the US and Mexico, by the way.  Lots of countries that share borders have clashes of interests that lead to them becoming rivals.  The US and Mexico aren't that different from other countries like this.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can you find long-lasting American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  Both of these countries are right next to the US and have been at odds with it, while other Latin American countries get along pretty well with the US.  \n\nReligious differences caused a huge rift between the US and Mexico, and this is something that's happened to a lot of other countries too.  Sally Frahm (2001) said that \"if Americans were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century, in the 18th and 19th they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86).  It's kinda like how the Cold War was a mix of ideological struggles and competing interests, but in this case, it was more about the US and Mexico having different ideas about what was important.  This distrust started because the US and Mexico inherited it from their former colonial rulers - the English and Spanish.  This made it tough for the two countries to have a good relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted 17 disputes between the US and Mexico during the 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes were about border stuff, like bandits and outlaws crossing the border and causing trouble.  It wasn't until both countries started using military force to control their borders that things started to calm down (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) said the rivalry started to fade away as \"Mexico became dependent on the US in a big way\" (p. 109) and eventually ended when American ambitions changed from trying to take over land to trying to influence Mexico's economy (p.110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I hit rock bottom after a mysterious illness left me disabled and unable to work. At the time, I was a nurse with a dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, but life had other plans. People kept telling me, \"You'll always find a job; people will always get sick,\" so I chose nursing as a secure career choice. Little did I know that my security would soon be turned upside down.\n\nFast forward to my life at 46: I'm single, broke, and living on disability checks. I've lost count of the days when I thought I had nothing left to call my own. Every day is a struggle to survive, and my self-esteem takes a hit. But one thing I know for sure is that I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few true friends. When disaster strikes, you realize how fragile you are, and how much you need the help of others.\n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies – big and small. No matter how prepared you are, some things are just too big to handle on your own. So, let's stop relying solely on the government to save us and start building a safety net of our own. Instead of bailing out to build our own fallout shelters, let's learn to trust each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe Conservatives talk about rugged individualism, but it was actually community and compassion that kept our ancestors going in tough times. The pioneers who trekked across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it by going it alone – they relied on each other for support.\n\nSo, be prepared, but don't forget the importance of community. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a stash of canned goods, but I also try to know my neighbors and look out for them. It's time for us to stop relying solely on ourselves and start building a network of people who will help each other out when things get tough.",
            "It's still a mystery why organisms evolve the way they do. There are probably some rules or boundaries that determine which way they change over time. Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson pointed out that biologists are still pretty clueless about describing the simplest living things in math terms. But more recently, math has been used to figure out how certain types of animals build their shells over time, like the way they grow and develop (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is working on using math to understand how animals like the ones in the Prunum family grow their shells and change over time. We're combining math with experiments to see what makes some of these animals change in certain ways. We looked at X-ray pictures of different Prunum species and used the information to create math models of their shells. These models helped us see what their shells could look like if they changed in different ways. Now we're combining these models with our experiments to learn more about how these animals evolved over time.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that moves through space over time. It's like a big spiral that goes around in a circle, and each part of the spiral is called a whorl. The middle of the shell is like an imaginary stick that runs through the middle of the spiral. This stick is called the columella. The speed at which the spiral grows can change, and the lines that separate each whorl are called sutures. Most shells have a big spiral at the end, which is called the body whorl. The rest of the spiral is called the spire. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at a shell from different angles, like looking at the top, bottom, front, or back. Most people look at shells with the front side facing them and the top pointing up. \n\nThere's a way to count the whorls on a shell. First, look at the shell from the top and find the first line where the whorls start to separate. Then draw a line to divide the shell in two. Count the whorls from this line, and you can even estimate a quarter of a whorl if you need to.\n\nA shell is like a series of holes that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. You can follow the path of the holes by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. This path can be drawn and mathematically explained. Once you have the math formula, you can change the rules and see how the animal's shell changes.",
            "It's been a decade since Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have changed much.  Even though the country is doing pretty well in achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals, like getting clean water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health is nowhere near what it needs to be to reach its targets by 2015.  In the next few sections, I'll be talking about the reasons behind this lack of improvement, and you'll see why Indonesia needs to focus on strengthening its healthcare system rather than just working on individual programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in getting skilled workers at births, with 72% of births now getting this kind of care.  But this number is a bit misleading since it includes traditional workers like midwives who can't provide medical help if a pregnancy gets complicated - which is why a lot of maternal deaths are due to hemorrhage.  Additionally, there's been a drop in the percentage of kids under five who get treated by a health professional for diarrhea, and the data on post-natal care is pretty incomplete, but it's clear that it's a big problem all over the country.\n\nC-section rates are still pretty low at 4%, and that's got some major implications.  The rate is 7% in cities, but only 2% in rural areas, which shows that healthcare services are mostly focused on city areas.  There's also a huge gap in access to healthcare between the richest and poorest families - 27% to be exact.  This means the poor are having a hard time getting the care they need, probably because they can't afford it.\n\nSo, the big question is how to make things better, starting with getting more healthcare services available.  Should Indonesia focus on developing special programs or just making the overall healthcare system stronger?  It's clear that special programs can get fast results, but they also have some big drawbacks.  One problem is that when you invest a lot in one area, other areas might get left behind.  Another issue is that all these separate programs can get really confusing and make a lot of extra paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate details and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  Two novels that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Instead of following the typical Victorian style, these novels incorporate a sense of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which helps to deepen our understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions. These atypical elements give us insight into their inner workings, making them feel more real and relatable.\n\nAs Fagin's character in Oliver Twist was walking between Sikes and Crackit, arguing, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was still there; the words they were saying echoed in his mind, and when he snapped out of it, he found himself talking to them.  Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire and was whisked away by an unseen force.  Through this disorienting experience, a nagging sense of pain lingered, wearing him down and tormenting him.\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests itself through dream sequences or dreamlike states.  In Oliver Twist, these bizarre events give us a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, revealing what hurts him and how he perceives the events unfolding around him.  When Oliver is shot in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if it's a dream, while struggling to find help.  The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over his situation, as well as his dire circumstances, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses, and he feels his despair wash over him again, this time laced with fear rather than surprise.  With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises as to who is responsible for his misfortune, since it certainly wasn't him.  This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his life, and that he's unable to even attempt to take charge of an event's outcome, even when his life is on the line.  A growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and lose his ability to react.\n\nThe day after the shooting passed quickly – it was over before it began – and night fell again, a long and dreadful silence that seemed to last forever, yet was over in what felt like an instant.",
            "A couple years back, I worked with a pretty cool after-school program where I helped Elementary school kids with their homework and whatever they were struggling with in class. My thing was reading and English, though. One of the instructors asked me to work with a little dude named Adrian, who was having a super tough time reading. I figured something was up; it was weird because he knew some letters super well, but others were a total mystery to him. I'm pretty sure he was of Latin background, and he spoke English like a pro, but I was still confused. We struggled through that until the day I met his mom. I was hanging out with him while the rest of the group went on a field trip, and his mom showed up. She only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish skills are basically non-existent, but we managed to communicate somehow. It hit me like a ton of bricks then: Adrian could totally read, but he just didn't know the English alphabet super well. I don't know if that realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing way better now.\n\nI'm telling this story because it highlights the problem of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as it seems, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can be super tough for them too. We all agree that this is a problem, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: just some extra tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciation. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of these things alone will fix it. We need to combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is actually a pretty great idea, not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. Apparently, kids in two-way bilingual education programs do way better in school. A lot of people freak out about this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we made this the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from it. So how do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's a bit unrealistic. What we could do is have special bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to help out.",
            "Most of us are told from a young age that there's something greater than us out there - something we can't fully comprehend. Some of us attend Sunday school, others go to Temple, and some search within themselves for answers. Many of us stick to the faith passed down by our parents, but some of us reject it entirely, thinking there's nothing beyond what we can see in our own little world. We might change our minds and try a different value system later on. Whatever path we choose, we're on a journey to figure out who we are based on our own unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us out of the dark and into the light.\n\nMy dad told me that cardinals are his favorite bird when I asked. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain pounding on the tin roof, the sound echoing off the wet plants by the edge of the porch. He was staring out into the rain, a look that was both searching and remembering. He'd lost a lot of weight lately, and his old clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair was thinner, too. I felt scared and alone, and I didn't know how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him without making it too real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nThat was the last time I saw my dad. He passed away in December, just five days before my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation hadn't made him feel better, but had kept him alive for a few more months longer than the doctors said he'd make it. I wondered what the point was in suffering so long if it didn't get any easier. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago. I didn't say any prayers that night because I didn't want to ask for anything. I just wanted to remember my dad the way he was, not the way he left.\n\nI didn't watch him die because I couldn't bear to see the person who made me leave this life behind. I wanted to remember him for who he was, not how he went. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. I curled up in a ball in bed for three days, waiting for the news. No one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a bit of an irony, an oxymoron combining \"old\" and \"new,\" as Ian Watt so cleverly points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. Throughout history, the Gothic mode has been praised and bashed, with some people thinking it's all superficial and others finding depth in its \"terrible sublime\" qualities (Burke). When Horace Walpole created the original \"Gothic Novel,\" The Castle of Otranto, he mixed elements from ancient romances and modern novels to invent a fresh way of writing. He called it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew inspiration from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, even though it was initially seen as old-fashioned or unsophisticated compared to the modern world. The blend of the theatrical and the new format of the novel, which lets readers see the characters' inner thoughts, is what made Gothic novels last and stay relevant, becoming both outdated and new to readers from different time periods.\n\nOne of the key Gothic ideas is the concept of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval idea of chivalry, which was meant to create a proper knight, was taken and transformed. Chivalry was important to Gothic writers because it represented the ideal knight – brave, honorable, and competent – and they saw a lack of those qualities in their own time. By using chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" was idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the future of Gothic to Romantic) and used to try to improve the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was living through a tumultuous time and was worried about the future. Feeling let down by politics and unfairly accused, he might have thought that the supposed good nature of people in the gothic era was lost in modern society. This idea is clear in characters like Frederic, who's described as:\n\nThe description of Frederic includes many chivalric images; he's a prince who's suffered, been affected by tragedy, and supposedly killed by infidels. This exaggerated portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" introduces the Gothic trope of excess, which will become a recurring theme (66).",
            "So, you want to know about supply chain management? It's basically the whole process of getting stuff from the person who wants it (the customer) all the way back to the raw materials that make it. It's like a big chain of events that happens really fast. The term supply chain management was invented by Keith Oliver back in 1982. He said it's all about planning, implementing, and controlling the whole process so you can satisfy customers quickly and efficiently. There are six main parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best customer service ever.\n\nProduction is the very first step in the process. It's like the foundation of the whole thing. You need to figure out when, why, where, and how you're going to make the stuff. To do that, you have to know what the customer wants, so you look at the market. The market is like a big indicator of what people are into. Once you know what they want, you can decide what to make and how much of it. After that, you figure out where to make it and which factory is best for quality and quantity. You also have to make sure the customer is happy, or else it's all pointless.\n\nThe next step is scheduling work and taking care of the equipment. This is super important because if you don't plan everything out, it can cost you a lot of time and money in the long run. I know this from my old job at Wal-Mart and Target. We had a super specific plan for everything, from how the uniforms looked to when the shipments came in. It made everything run smoothly and nobody got confused.\n\nThe second key element is supply. This is all about deciding what you're good at and who you should partner with. Let's say you make a bunch of different products and each one needs a different setup. You have to decide which one is best for each part of the process. You might even outsource some of the work to other companies to save time and money. The goal is to be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "I was walking down the street the other day and saw this crazy sign being held by Ellen Page, star of Juno. It read, \"Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\" I thought it was pretty wild. Burma, or Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia where the government is super strict. They took over in 1962 after a big power struggle. Last year, the people there started protesting, led by monks who wore these orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution, and at first, the government was kinda cool with it, but things quickly escalated into a full-blown conflict. The military started attacking the monks and their monasteries, and anyone who was seen as a threat was arrested or worse. Foreign journalists were even killed, like this Japanese dude named Kenji Nagai. We're not even sure how many people died, but some reports say thousands.\n\nThis isn't new, though. Governments have been trying to shut down dissent for ages. The ancient Romans thought their emperors were gods, and the Japanese still think their emperors are, like, actual gods. Our current president talks to some crazy dude named Ted Haggard, who's like, the leader of some super right-wing group. It's like, what's the difference between them and the Chinese government, which killed all these people in Tiananmen Square in '89? The official story says a few hundred died, but other reports say it was way more, like 2,000-3,000. And then there was the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia groups killed all these Tutsis and moderates. Hitler's whole \"Third Reich\" thing was pretty much the same deal.",
            "Duke Ellington’s impact on jazz is super big because he was around for so long and was so creative with his orchestra. Some of his songs, like the ones for this project, don't even have him on the piano, but as a composer, Ellington was a master at writing music that made each band member shine. He created this framework where soloists could just go wild and improvise, and at the same time, he'd write pieces that highlighted each band member's style. This way, he made the whole orchestra sound super cool and original. Ellington was also really good at understanding how each player sounded alone, and how they fit together in the group, which allowed him to write some of the most genius and amazing jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about how Ellington used voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in his whole career, and it's a good example of this in his song Creole Love Call. It's a slow, bluesy piece where he used voice to add some extra texture and color, without even needing lyrics. This song also shows how Ellington was great at making his soloists sound awesome, which he did in a lot of his music. The song has six different parts, and each one is like a mini-story. \n\nChorus 1: It starts with the voice and the reeds talking to each other, with the voice being super smooth and melodic at first, but then getting a bit rougher at the end.\nChorus 2: Then there's a muted trumpet solo that takes the basic melody and makes it sound even better, with some extra notes that make it sound really cool.\nChorus 3: After that, there's a clarinet solo that's super fast and high-pitched, with a piano phrase that's really funky.\nChorus 4: The next part is like a big echo of the first chorus, but with the brass and reed sections talking to each other.\nChorus 5: The final part is the most intense, with the reeds starting to talk back, and the brass section making some really cool rhythms.\nChorus 6: The last part goes back to the first chorus, but this time the voice is using a special technique called the \"growl\" to sound like it's playing an instrument.\nThe last part is just a quick tag with a vocal run and some weird, dissonant sounds from a trombone.\n\nThis is just one example of how Ellington used voice to add some extra flavor to his music. In his song Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill at making the orchestra sound tight with his ear for making sounds that sound really cool. In that song, he has a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, where they use both vocal and instrumental parts to make something really rich and cool. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) takes this idea even further, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone, and it sounds amazing.",
            "I've had this thing inside me for a while now - this feeling that something's missing. It started when I was 14, right when I was getting into the whole teenage scene. Now I'm 17, and it's still there. I've come to realize I'm looking for someone, not just something, but I just can't seem to find anyone I'm into. Some guys have tried to get my attention, and they've all gone through the usual awkward stages, but none of them have been able to hold my interest. I've spent years trying to figure out what's going on with this, and I've come up with a bunch of ideas, but nothing that really makes sense. So I just keep living life, still trying to figure it out.\n\nAt home, things are pretty chill. My parents are super laid-back and rarely argue about anything. The only times they do get into a fight are when they disagree with my independent streak. I'm the calm and collected daughter of two super mellow parents, but I'm like the complete opposite - I'm all about living life to the fullest and being true to myself. But today was different. I was walking around the house trying to find some new ideas, when I heard my mom let out a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. I ran in there, freaking out, and saw my mom on the ground, clearly in agony. She was saying \"Ow\" over and over, and I knew I had to act fast. I rushed to her side and helped her up. She told me to take her to the hospital - I could tell she was in a lot of pain. I got her to the car and drove her there myself.\n\nWhen we got to the hospital, the smell of disinfectant and sickness hit me, but I was too worried about my mom to feel scared. I helped her onto a rolling bed and called for the doctors. They took her in right away, and I was left sitting there, worried sick.\n\nApparently, my mom had slipped off a stool while trying to grab a vase from the top shelf. I was relieved when the doctors took her in and started checking her out. Now I'm just waiting and hoping everything turns out okay.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high score on the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\" scale, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet that consists of higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and monounsaturated fats, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are allowed.\n\nPast studies showed that following the Med diet was associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention study found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, these previous studies didn't focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study involved 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years old, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a research project following 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The authors calculated the aMed diet score six times from 1984 to 2004 using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that assessed participants' nutrient intake during the previous year. More than 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year study period. These questionnaires were validated through other studies. The researchers verified reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke by reviewing medical records, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records weren't available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the study, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. Age, smoking status, body mass index, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each questionnaire, and starting in 1986, the participants' leisure-time physical activity was also evaluated.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, the researchers averaged together the aMed scores from repeated questionnaires over time (averaging scores from two prior years). The study adjusted for potential \"confounders\" (factors that could affect the results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in the women. Over the course of 20 years, the researchers identified 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women who scored highest on the aMed diet were less likely to experience both CHD and stroke compared to those who scored lowest (with a relative risk of 0.71).",
            "So, let's talk about this super crazy financial crisis that hit the United States back in 2007. It was like, a total nightmare – unemployment went up, the housing market went down, and all these huge corporations were left in shambles. We're still dealing with the aftermath, so it's time to figure out what happened and how to stop it from happening again. In a nutshell, the financial crisis was caused by some pretty selfish and clueless politicians who pushed banks and companies to give out these sketchy sub-prime loans to people who couldn't really afford them. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to buy up and package these bad loans into these super complex financial things called CDOs and CDSs. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were like, \"uh-oh, we don't have enough money!\" and they tried to pawn off the problem onto these repackaged mortgages they'd already sold, and then onto the rest of the economy.\n\nIt all started back in 1999 when Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he relaxed some lending rules, which set the stage for this whole sub-prime mess that happened seven years later. Steven Holmes from the New York Times was like a total genius and predicted this whole thing would go down. He said, \"Hey, Fannie Mae is under pressure from the government to give out more loans to low-income people, and also from its stockholders who just want more profits.\" And then he nailed it: \"But if there's an economic downturn, Fannie Mae will be in big trouble and the government will have to bail it out, just like they did with the savings and loan industry in the 80s.\" Yeah, that's exactly what happened.\n\nA bunch of other factors contributed to the economy going haywire. There were all these new, super complicated mortgage things like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs that tied up the whole economy with the housing market. This made households and financial markets super vulnerable to even small changes in housing prices. And, well, the housing bubble burst, and all these financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were like, \"Oh no, what do we do?\" The top five investment banks were stuck with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which is like, a huge chunk of the USA's GDP. In the end, some of these banks got sold for a steal, while others got dismantled or forced to become \"normal\" banks with lots of rules to follow. Fannie and Freddie were in huge trouble too, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and the government had to step in and take control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - the villain of the writer's world.  It's that part in your story where you try to take off like a superhero, but end up face-planting into a pool of boring text that puts your readers to sleep or makes them vow to never come back to your site.  I know Dr. Merlin has been known to scream at her computer when she gets stuck in Exposition Limbo, and not in the cool, edgy way.\n\nExposition is the nemesis that every writer needs to conquer.  Even if you know the \"Show, don't tell\" rule, you're still likely to find yourself stuck in a sea of unnecessary details that don't move the plot forward.\n\nExposition is when you dump a ton of backstory, history, or info onto your readers without giving them a chance to breathe.  It's like the character in your story telling another character their entire life story in one breath - as seen in those epic tales like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's you, the author, doing the telling instead.\n\nTo illustrate this, imagine reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved at a certain time and place, gets married in style, and then has her husband brutally murdered in front of her.  You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to take two whole pages, right?  And you certainly wouldn't expect the husband and wife to only get two lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to spend some quality time developing the husband's character, showing how much he loves his wife through his words and actions, and revealing how she's changed and grown because of him.  This would make his death even more impactful and your connection to the heroine deeper.\n\nIn short, you'd want to add some meat to the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  As a writer, it's your job to provide that meat.  Sometimes it's tempting to rush through certain parts, but don't be tempted - give your readers what they want and need to care about your story.",
            "I just watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about some serious stuff in Ashley, Ohio - a dude named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. They only showed a quick bit on this, like two minutes, 'cause it was still developing. All they said was that he had stabbed her multiple times and got arrested. I think they handled it pretty fairly. \n\tNext up was a story about a shooting in Sharon Woods. Some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot, but they didn't have any suspects or arrests. The SWAT team was investigating. This story felt kinda short, and I think it might've been because the victim was a black kid from a black neighborhood. I've noticed this pattern before - when a minority gets hurt, the media usually doesn't give it much airtime. But if a white person gets hurt, it's huge news. \n\tThe next story was about a Med-Flight helicopter getting a .22 caliber bullet hole in it. They said they think it happened somewhere specific, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-grand reward for any tips that help catch the shooter. \n\tThen there was a story about some rain and thunderstorms coming on Saturday. They said the weekend was gonna be in the mid-to-low eighties, but it was a pretty short clip - I think they just wanted to keep us watching. \n\tThey also did a piece on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. They said the perp was a dark-skinned black guy wearing a hoodie, and they spent a weird amount of time emphasizing how dark he was. \n\tLastly, they had a story about Rene Rodriguez, a Texas dude who was convicted of running a big marijuana operation from Texas to Ohio. He got sentenced to 300 months in prison, which I thought was a weird way to say 25 years. They also mentioned he's Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant.",
            "There's a bond between brothers that's like a fortress, unbreakable and unshakable. It's a bond that holds a bunch of complicated emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. When you have a brother, you kinda get them, you know? They're like a mirror image of yourself, and they can only see themselves when they look at you. But it's when things get really tough that you find out what's really going on in that bond. It's then that you see the good and the bad, and it's not always easy to deal with. When you can look a brother in the eye and see your own reflection staring back at you, you're forced to confront who you really are and what you're really made of. It's in their actions and the consequences of those actions that you see what someone's really like. This theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis\", where two brothers are on a wild adventure that goes totally wrong. Their journey is like a rollercoaster of emotions, with bitter disappointment and intense pride clashing in the end. Only one of them gets out alive, but the other brother's spirit lives on.\n\nThe story is all about how one brother feels, especially about pride. He's got this huge ego and he wants his little brother, Doodle, to be someone he can teach all the cool stuff to, like how to hold his breath and run fast. But Doodle's got a weak heart, and it's like his whole dream is crushed. The big brother's got a mix of emotions, from anger to love, and it's hard to say which one's stronger. He even thinks about doing something crazy, but when Doodle smiles, he starts to feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It shows that deep down, he really loves his little bro. The story's all about how this complicated bond between brothers works, and how it can drive you crazy, but also how it can be super strong.",
            "So, the brain is basically a super cool, super advanced machine that can do all sorts of crazy stuff. As technology has gotten better and better, people have come up with new ways to describe how the brain works. At first, it was like a piece of wax, then a scroll, then a book, and now it's like a super powerful computer. However, these comparisons aren't perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong conclusions.\n\nSo, let's start with the basics. The brain takes in information from our senses, which turn things like touch, sound, and light into electrical signals. It then processes this info in two different ways: bottom-up and top-down. Think of bottom-up like putting together a puzzle – it starts with simple pieces of info like color, shape, and edges, and then puts them together to figure out what you're seeing. Top-down is like using what you already know to help you make sense of things faster. For example, if you see a picture of a black box on a white background, top-down processing can help you figure out it's a box, not a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed some info, it decides which signals are important and sends them to the right places. It's like having a filter that says, \"Hey, don't worry about those individual blades of grass, but let's pay attention to your name when someone says it really loudly.\" There are lots of steps to processing, and attention plays a big role in deciding what's important and what's not.\n\nBut before the brain can process info, it has to store it somehow. There are different kinds of memory, like short-term and long-term, and they work in different ways. When we first get info, it gets encoded, or put into the brain in a way that makes sense. This encoding depends on what kind of info it is – like how words look, sound, or mean. Once it's stored, the brain has to keep it around. Scientists think that short-term memory might be like a temporary electrical signal, while long-term memory is stored in special proteins.\n\nThere are all sorts of theories about how the brain organizes information. Some are based on how people remember things, some on computer science, and some on brain science. One cool theory is the semantic network, where ideas are connected to each other like a web. For example, the idea of a \"chair\" is linked to a \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of both technology and the capitalistic system that supports it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this world, people are conditioned to prioritize community and instant happiness above all else. The citizens are basically pawns in a larger game, forced to conform to the World Controller's ideology. By looking at the book through a Marxist lens, you can see that Huxley is basically saying that this is a bad idea. He uses words and ideas from Marxism, like homogeny and reification, to show that he thinks this system is messed up.\n\nThe way Huxley uses satire to criticize capitalism is pretty cool. He's talking about something called false consciousness, which is like when people don't know how they're really connected to the people around them, especially in terms of money. In Brave New World, people are so focused on their own stuff that they can't see the bigger picture. The World Controller is basically controlling everyone, making them think that all they need to do is consume and indulge in stuff. This is super obvious in how the lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are controlled through hypnopædia. They don't really have any control over their own lives. They're just following what they're told. This is basically an example of hegemony, which is when a group of people is controlled by a smaller group of people. The people in control are the ones who get to decide what's best for everyone else, and the lower classes just go along with it. They're basically buying into this system that's set up to keep them down.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are really superficial. People don't really care about each other, they just care about how they look and what they can get out of each other. It's like Huxley is saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and their ability to be themselves. Love and strong emotions don't exist in this world, and people are just going through the motions. The way the characters interact with each other is really shallow, like when the guys talk about the women just because of how they look, or when the women talk about their shallow relationships. This is all a commentary on how people are just following the rules and not really thinking for themselves. They're all just going along with what the system tells them to do, which is basically a Marxist idea about how the working class is brainwashed into thinking they're better than everyone else as long as they keep consuming and following the rules.",
            "I've been attending University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters, and navigating the campus can be a real pain. Like many others, I've had my share of struggles getting around. During my freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room, basically as far east as you can get on campus, except for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It would take me up to 25 minutes to get to places like Willard building near the center of campus on foot, especially when the weather was bad, which it often is in State College. I talked to an alum who's only a bit older than me, and they told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by huge empty spaces. Now those areas are filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, getting from one place to another is becoming more and more of a challenge. On a college campus, the best solution to this problem is the humble bicycle. But just having a bike isn't enough; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently talked to a friend who got back into biking after a few years off, and he said it's crazy he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for you, it's also super efficient. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergrads, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest move I made this year was buying a bike. Every day I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with my bike, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. There are some good things about walking too, but personally, I don't have time for it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take me an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week, which is just too much time to waste."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths.

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I pursue my education in social work, I'm set on a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to make a difference in the lives of abused or neglected kids, and to lend a helping hand to struggling families. Some key values that I'll bring to the social work field are service, respect, ethics, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional skills – staying on top of my game, so to speak. These aren't just important for social workers; they're personal values for me too.\n\nGrowing up, I always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to take. During high school and college, I saw people dodging their problems and some dealing with issues in not-so-great ways. After witnessing some pretty tough stuff, I decided to go for a degree in Psychology. Still unsure about my next step, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old kid who was really struggling – he'd run away from his abusive parents. The next day, he called the cops on them. I went to their house, where I told the police about my concerns and shared that I had a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. They asked me to speak with the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I talked to the parents, they seemed really nervous and made excuses for their kid's actions. After that, I seriously considered a career in social work to help kids deal with family drama.\n\nSocial justice is another value that's super important in the social work field. We say that individuals matter, but in reality, we're often more about conforming to old traditions than being unique. If we're all about mourning lost individuals, then why do we try to be like everyone else? I'm an individual and I don't want to put limits on myself to fit in with the crowd. In high school and college, I spoke out against social injustice whenever I could – I colored my hair weird colors, wore clothes that fit my personality, got my ears pierced in a more alternative way, joined GSBA, and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fighting against it.",
            "The following study delves into the biological and sociocultural models associated with insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on the genetic factors that are passed down through generations as well as the medical aspects of overall health. On the other hand, the sociocultural model looks at how environmental factors, such as ethnicity, demographics, socioeconomic status, and more, contribute to the disorder. This paper will explore and examine the various pieces of research related to these models in order to better grasp their intricacies. An analysis of the research findings and their strengths and weaknesses will be presented in this review.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three distinct groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders connected to other mental health issues, and sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental health issues are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssonmias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining a restful sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by an excessive desire to stay awake, both lasting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM. \n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genetic factors, heritable traits, and the physiological aspects of sleep. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time, as discovered by Matsuki et al. (2009). This study implies that findings from animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This has significant sociocultural implications, as the phenotype could be inherited, regulating sleep, and any alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep patterns for an individual. This, in turn, could impact daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This paper explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the way the brain handles what we hear. Put simply, people with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brain can't properly sort out what's going on. I mean, imagine trying to have a conversation at a loud party - it's hard to focus on what one person is saying when there's a lot of background noise, right? That's kinda what's happening with CAPD. It's not that they can't hear, it's just that their brain can't separate the good stuff from the noise. \n\nCAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers first started studying kids with communication problems. They called it \"auditory imperception\" back then, but now we know it as CAPD. A team of Italian researchers, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, actually started developing tests for CAPD back in 1954. Later, in 1961, Kimura came up with a model that explained how the brain handles different sounds, and it's been a topic of study ever since.\n\nSo, what does CAPD look like? Well, it can manifest in all sorts of ways. Some people might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from, or they might get confused by different sounds happening at the same time. They might struggle to recognize patterns or changes in speech, like when someone says something sarcastically. It's like their brain gets all mixed up and can't untangle what's going on. And if you're trying to listen to two people talking at the same time, it can be super hard for them to block out one sound and focus on the other.\n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors and other specialists use a bunch of different tests. They might ask questions and observe how people respond to different sounds, like a bunch of words or numbers all at once. It's not like there's one magic test that can diagnose it, but it's all about getting a sense of how the brain handles sound. Some tests even use fancy equipment to record sounds and see how the brain responds. And, at the end of the day, there's no known cause for CAPD, so it's all about figuring out the best way to help people deal with it.\n\nTeachers in mainstream classrooms can help out by being aware of these common \"red flags\" - you know, the signs that might indicate someone has CAPD. They can use special techniques to make it easier for students with CAPD to focus and understand what's going on. By being understanding and accommodating, teachers can make a big difference in the lives of students with CAPD.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that disguises can be pretty useful for getting away with huge deceptions for a long time, but in the end, you gotta ditch that new disguise or risk losing yourself in the process forever. The thing is, getting rid of that deception can also make you pretty alienated from others, since some people might not take it well. You're basically stuck between saving yourself or keeping your relationships with the people around you. While some will be all chill about it, others will freak out and be totally turned off by the whole thing. \n\nThe part about disguising yourself as the opposite gender gets really tricky because it brings up a bunch of other issues. Like, why do people do it in the first place? In Viola's case, she pretends to be a dude so she can protect herself from people trying to hurt her. She's a bit like, \"Hey, I'll just go to this captain and he'll help me hide out near Count Orsino so I can serve him.\" (She's talking about her plan at the beginning of Act 5, Scene 1.)\n\nSo, Viola dresses up as a guy and it works, but it also makes her lose touch with the women around her and makes her miss out on a support system. And to make matters worse, she's so good at pretending to be a dude that Olivia gets all confused and starts thinking she's a guy named Sebastian and falls for her. Then there's the whole thing with Viola and Orsino, who's all like, \"You've told me a million times you wouldn't love a woman like me.\" (Act 5, Scene 1, again.)\n\nBut, looking at it from today's perspective, Twelfth Night can be seen as a way to show how deception can help people figure out things they've been hiding, especially for Olivia and Orsino. There are some parts that seem to hint that Olivia might be secretly into women, but I guess that's not really what it's about. Olivia's more likely just making fun of people who judge others based on looks. It's pretty clear when she starts to really like Sebastian and forgets all about Cesario/Viola. It's like she says, \"You're like a sister to me.\" (Act 5, Scene 1.) It sounds like Olivia is just messing with people who judge based on appearance.",
            "You can't even begin to understand the real deal about German colonial rule. I mean, yeah, it was super brutal, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa. But you can't just lump the whole empire into one neat little package. It was all over the place with different policies and styles in every colony, just like how it varied in geography. Education was no exception - some colonies were actually doing pretty well, like German East Africa (now Tanganyika) where the Brits found a bunch of super smart and literate Africans in 1919. They were even giving German colonial efforts in Kamerun and other places a thumbs up from authors back in the day.\n\nBut then there's South West Africa (now Namibia), where things were super different. Unlike East Africa where the government was all about setting up schools and educating the locals, in South West Africa they basically left it all to the missionaries who were getting pretty minimal support from the government. Yet, they still managed to throw a ton of resources at educating Europeans in the colony, setting up state schools and regulating the missionaries. This all had some major long-term effects on South West Africa, even after the Germans were gone. While other German colonies were rocking with educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa \"most people were basically clueless, uneducated, and illiterate.\" There were a bunch of reasons for this, and I want to dive deeper into them in this paper, especially the attitudes of settlers and colonial officials towards the locals.\n\nThere's a bunch of research out there on education in the German colonies, but most of it is in German and from the early 20th century. These early works were all about describing the educational systems in these colonies. Later stuff in English expanded on it by comparing education in different colonies and getting into the nitty-gritty of specific aspects. It turns out that every colony was doing its own thing with education, and the most famous work on this topic is probably Cohen's study of South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the two and talks about the factors that made them so different. Apparently, the big settler population in South West Africa is a major reason for the difference.\n\nSouth West Africa was pretty chill for Europeans, with a relatively nice climate, but most of the land was basically a desert. This made it super appealing to Europeans, and by 1913 there were almost 15,000 of them living there, which was way more than in any other colony except East Africa.",
            "Heavy metal music has undergone a huge transformation over the past 100 years, expanding into so many different genres that it's a real challenge to make a list of them all. To make matters even more complicated, most of these genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres within their own domains. I'm gonna argue that the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has become one of the most expressive and diverse genres of popular music in the last 40 years. It's expressive because it showcases a wide range of emotions, mostly on the darker side of the spectrum, but also because it's incredibly flexible, allowing people to take it in their own unique direction. \n\nYou could say we've reached a point in the heavy metal movement where it's hard to pinpoint what exactly heavy metal is, given how many niches and sub-niches it's branched out into by incorporating elements from other genres. But to truly understand the metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta understand the metal movement itself and where it all started. It's actually defined by darkness, heavy metal being the \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatrics. It's about musicians who really know their craft, and that skill shines through in the music. Some say metal is also a movement heavily influenced by psychedelics, which were all the rage in the 70s, and were used as a creative outlet for musicians to tap into their wilder side. This music often deals with the darker aspects of life, which was a new and exciting thing back in the day when most popular music was pretty laid-back. Some later metal bands even took a cue from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Some lyrics that showcase the darker side of metal include the following from Helter Skelter, which is like a showcase of the Beatles' wilder side. This song is actually considered by some to be one of the first heavy metal songs, as a response to a similar song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they added this song to The White Album.",
            "Before the Surrealists were painting their trippy works, Henri Rousseau was busy living his own dream, literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, isn't just some chick checking out the sights in a fantasy world – it's also a reflection of his own personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. For years, Rousseau wanted the art world to give him a shout-out, and he was stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, he wanted to fit in with the cool art kids and follow the latest styles, but on the other hand, he wanted to be true to himself and paint his own way.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's backstory. He was born on May 21, 1844, in some small town in northwest France. His dad was a hardware dealer who was pretty well-off, but Rousseau didn't get any fancy art training. Instead, he worked for the French government as a toll collector until he was 40. People called him a customs inspector, but that's not exactly what he was. After his first wife and eight little kids died, Rousseau was left with just one kid, Julia, and a whole lot of sadness. Painting was his escape, his way to start fresh. Unlike some other artists of his time, Rousseau wasn't all about painting pretty peasants; he was a folk painter, and his art was all about regular people's hopes and dreams.\n\nIt's no wonder Rousseau wanted the art world to like him. I mean, he was basically starting from scratch, and he was doing it at an older age than most artists. Plus, he was competing with some super talented and famous artists. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse was getting famous that Rousseau started getting recognition for his work. In his book, Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon says that Rousseau and Matisse were like total opposites. Matisse was all about not being boring, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would accept him as a real artist.",
            "A lot of deep thinkers have suggested that ethics and aesthetics are close friends - that truth and beauty are connected in some way. I think there's a reason for this that goes all the way down to the basics. As John Keats says in his poem, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we learn in life comes from school or personal experience, but we tend to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without needing to be taught. Ethics and aesthetics are both about trying to figure out why something is beautiful or moral, as opposed to providing a set of rules for creating good art or good behavior. \n\nTo get to the point, people can never really put their finger on exactly what makes something good or beautiful. Talking about the value of something like the Mona Lisa might involve stuff like background, foreground, or cultural context, but these things don't capture what makes it good art. When people talk about their favorite piece of art, they often say something like \"There's just something about it\" before getting into the details. I think that both art and morals have this thing that can't be totally explained. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how well we describe a work of art, there's always something more to it. I think morality has the same property. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think this \"something\" that's hard to put into words is what makes art and morality so powerful, and it's what connects them.\n\nI believe that morals and art are connected because we experience them at a deep, almost unexplainable level. This connection is even stronger when it comes to literature. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values...Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a country that's really come together, with its own unique vibe that's all over the place - from the mountains in München to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You can feel that culture in Köln, right on the Rhine River, all the way to Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise it's got such a cool culture considering it's made up of lots of different tribes and sources. They call it Germania, the land of the Germans, but nobody really knows where the name came from. Some think it's from a tribe called the Tungrians, and they were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought the Gauls (check out Tacitus, 98).\n\nJulius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his book about the Gallic Wars, which was all about beating up the Gauls and dealing with Germanic tribes that were always crossing the Rhine. He got the word from the Gauls themselves and used it to tell the difference between people he'd already conquered and those he hadn't. He even wrote about how the Germans were always at war with the Gauls in his book. Some people think the name comes from a spear they used in battles called a ger, or maybe from the Old Irish word \"garim\", which means they were super loud or rowdy. \n\nIn his book, written in 98 AD, Tacitus said that the Germans were basically a pure-blooded people who didn't mix with other cultures. He even wrote about how nobody would just leave Asia or Africa to come to Germany, which was pretty rough and wild. So, the Romans didn't really want to live there, but they did go there to trade and fight sometimes. Germanic tribes started showing up in the first century, and they'd trade goods and skills with the Romans, who mostly just went home after their campaigns.",
            "My eyes were fixed on something in front of me, but my mind was elsewhere, blank and unresponsive.  I went through the motions, staring at this thing, but it was like my brain was in a different room, studying it without really thinking about it.  Thoughts would pop up for a second, and then they'd be gone, like a fleeting thought that never really stuck.  It was like I was just going through the motions, not really thinking for myself, just experiencing whatever I was looking at.\n\nI'd picked up this art book a while back, The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, after an artist I worked with suggested it.  I'd always wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book was supposed to teach me the basics.  One trick it showed was to draw a square around whatever picture you're looking at, to simplify it and make it easier to understand.  I tried to do that, but at the time, I was so blown away by what I was looking at that I couldn't even think about drawing a frame around it.\n\nI was staring at this bowl of fruit, and all I could do was stand there, frozen in awe.  I thought about all the famous artists who'd done their own weird things with art - Picasso and his blue phase, Monet and his love of greenery, the Renaissance masters and their colorful stuff.  If I wanted to be an artist, then this was my chance to start something new, to make my own art.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand reached out and picked up my pencil, and for a second, I felt like I was creating something amazing.  But then I had to go use the bathroom, and that's when things started to go wrong.  I tried to, ah, \"create\" something in the toilet, but it just wouldn't budge.  I was getting a little anxious, and my hand was starting to shake.  I looked at the, um, \"art\" I was trying to create, and I just couldn't help but frown.  It was a real mess.\n\nI gripped the mop a little tighter, and I thought about how I was going to have to deal with this later.  I was already feeling pretty stressed out, and now I had to add this to the list.  I looked at the, ahem, \"masterpiece\" in front of me and just shook my head.  It was gonna be a long day...",
            "Teen drivers are a major cause of concern in the US.  Several factors contribute to this problem.  The National Institutes of Health say that one reason is that the teen brain is not ready to handle the risks of driving.  Teens also lack experience, which leads to more fatal accidents, a higher rate of rollover incidents, speeding, and driving off the road.  When teens drive with their friends, the danger increases even more.  A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the number of traffic accidents goes up as the age of the passenger gets younger.\n\nIn an attempt to make driving safer for teens, some states require temporary licenses that limit the number of hours they can drive and don't allow minors as passengers.  However, these licenses are only temporary fixes.  The real issue is that teens are, statistically, not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Marvin Zuckerman, a psychologist, thinks that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license.  He's done research showing that people under 19-20 often take risks just for the thrill of it.  This makes sense, so it's a good idea to delay driving until the tendency to take risks has decreased.  If we keep giving out driver's licenses to young teens, we'll see more deadly accidents and the death toll will probably get really high.  By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be on the road.\n\nMaking new laws to deal with this issue would be pretty simple.  Schools could still offer driver's education classes to teach future drivers the basics, but no one under 18 could drive.  We could still give out temporary permits before a full license, and require a certain number of driving practice hours.  The number of hours could be the same as most states require now (like 6 hours of driving lessons and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California).  Since this problem affects all states, a national law would be a good way to protect teen drivers across the country.  This idea isn't new, but it could really make a difference.",
            "I spent the day browsing through the early Edison films at the Library of Congress and decided to check out all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and they're all about using editing tricks to create illusions. I mainly analyzed the poetic aspects of these films and looked at how some of the later ones broke the rules. Back in the day, trick films were pretty set in their ways - they were static, stuck to a frontal proscenium, used long shots, and just one shot per film. It was like a one-trick pony, you know? But around the turn of the century, some films started to get a little wild and crazy and added in some new stuff like multiple shots.\n\nWhat really stood out to me about these trick films was that they were all shot on interior sets with a proscenium in the background. The camera never moved, no matter what. It was like it was stuck in one place, just like in a play or a magic show. I guess this is where the idea of a static set comes from - it's like a trapped stage. When I watched Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), I noticed that the actors would just move side to side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Even when they left the frame, the camera didn't budge. It was like they were stuck in some kind of weird, two-dimensional world.\n\nThese early trick films also stuck to long shots and occasional medium shots. Never any close-ups, just like in a play where the audience sees the whole scene at once. It's like the camera is trying to show you the whole performance at once, like a big ol' play. And the actors never move towards the camera, so you never get any close-ups. It's like they're stuck in some kind of frozen moment in time.\n\nMost of these early trick films are super short, like, under a minute, and they're all about doing one trick and getting out. It's like a magic show, where they just do a few tricks and then it's over. But, when you look closer, you realize that some of these films are actually made up of several short shots joined together to create some crazy illusion. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example - it looks like one shot, but if you really pay attention, you can see where the actual camera cuts happen.",
            "So there's this guy John Taylor from Caroline, and he was super into Republicanism from the get-go. He was a farmer at heart, but even with his farming and his brief stint in politics, he was known for being super outspoken about personal freedom and the government. His love for agriculture basically dictated his views on almost everything, including the government, sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system. He was all about preserving and promoting the best of the best when it came to careers, which influenced his arguments on just about everything.\n\nTaylor thought the US had a shot at creating the perfect system because they didn't have any pre-existing traditions to mess things up - it was a blank slate, basically. He was all about natural rights and how they're all connected - if one gets taken away, they all suffer, and the ones that are left are basically worthless. He believed these rights should be off-limits to the government. He thought the so-called \"state of nature\" was all about people with power and bad intentions getting ahead, but that shouldn't be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo make this ideal society a reality, Taylor believed a government had to be designed with both good and evil in mind. He was pretty rigid in his views on dualistic morality - he thought government is basically just a reflection of human nature. He said that governments have good and bad principles, and good principles are all about protecting private property, improving agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He thought a government with good principles would be fair no matter who was in charge, but the reality is that governments are usually run by greedy people. He believed self-interest was the driving force behind everything humans do, but it's only bad when it leads to a society that exploits others. A good government is necessary to keep humans' natural badness in check, but it needs to be watched closely to avoid adding any bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of other super-hardcore Republicans back then, was all about interpreting the Constitution super strictly. He wanted a super limited Federal government that only had the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He knew a big Federal government would be expensive and likely to become a dictatorship, but he also thought that just following the literal words of the Constitution without considering the writers' intentions could be super corrupt. And, to him, the Declaration of Independence was basically the US's true charter because it clearly states that we're a bunch of separate states rather than one country.",
            "Looking at Figure 17, it's clear that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was pretty discouraging, and it's hard to say exactly why it happened. One thing that might have contributed to it is that winter set in at our New England campus, which probably led to fewer people biking or walking to school. It's also possible that the end of the fall semester and the holiday season just got in the way – everyone was too busy finishing schoolwork and grades to bother filling out the log. Plus, the month-long break at the end of the semester probably meant a lot of people didn't need to come to campus at all. When classes resumed in January, we saw another low number of submissions, but that still doesn't explain the dip in February. It could be that people just got bored with the project after the initial excitement wore off. To counteract this, we tried something called the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which actually worked and boosted log submissions for that month. We figured out that one of our biggest challenges was getting people to stay engaged despite the natural decrease in interest, and also dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that are just part of higher education. \n\nAnother problem we faced was that a lot of people really love driving their cars, and that's just a big part of our culture. So we had to come up with incentives to get people to try alternative modes of transportation. We gave out some pretty cool prizes, like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. It would have been interesting to see if bigger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, would have made a difference – but unfortunately, we didn't get to try that out. We kept the same type of prizes throughout the project, but if we had announced some bigger prizes in December or January, it might have kept people engaged instead of losing interest. I mean, who wouldn't want to win a bike or a car?",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is pretty cool because it's like a security that copies an index, a commodity, or a bunch of assets, just like an index fund, but it's way more flexible and trades like a stock on the exchange.  It gives you the benefits of an index fund, like diversification, and the perks of owning a single stock, like being able to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase just one share at a time.  These benefits are super attractive, but the fees for ETFs are way lower than the average mutual fund.  However, there are some downsides, like you have to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just like with a stock order.  Another awesome thing about ETFs is that there's a huge variety of funds available.  But, it's always smart to be a savvy financial investor and check if the benefits you're told about, like diversification, are actually real, and how real they are.  For now, we're going to check out the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is just as good as owning a bunch of individual stocks.  \n\nTo make things less overwhelming, we're only going to look at the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets.  The top 10 holdings are listed below, along with their percentage of the total assets.\n\nBy looking at how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can use the current percentage of assets to calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF has them.  The calculations for Beta and Return are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it's pretty clear that a portfolio made up of just the top 10 holdings would return 6.11% more than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It's also pretty evident that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  So far, it seems like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a higher return with a lower Beta.  But, there's a chance that the means of these two portfolios might not be all that different statistically.\n\nTo figure out if these portfolios are statistically different, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and compared it to the standard deviation of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-Land is often considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's improved poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott thinks is linked back to the writings of Virgil. However, it's also possible that Poe got it from a more recent source - he was a big fan of German authors. \n\nThis connection is pretty significant because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe's work. Karl J. Arndt noticed in his book that Poe's poem Politian is similar to Goethe's Mignon, which led him to believe that Poe might have been inspired by Goethe. \n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature says that Goethe was famous for writing the poetic drama Faust, which came out in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year he died. There's a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\" hidden inside the second part of Faust. It's about a king who loses his wife and starts drinking heavily, then decides to die after remembering his dead queen. He throws away his goblet and walks to a cliff, where he dies. The King of Thulé and the character in Dream-Land have some pretty strong similarities, maybe even a dark opposite of Poe's own struggles with loss and drinking. \n\nFaust was also turned into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe mentions Thule twice in his collected works - once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" to bookend the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely place with dead friends and a world without color. This sounds a lot like the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem, who's just lost his wife and is feeling pretty down. It's like the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" stepped right into Goethe's poem. \n\nGoethe was a pretty big deal in the literary world, and Poe would have likely known about him, even if it was just through his respect for Tennyson. Poe said something about how he admired Tennyson, and he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through all the reproductions that were going on after the original publication.",
            "In California, if a customer slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store and got hurt, can they get punitive damages if the store manager knew about the spill but didn't clean it up for half an hour because he was too busy eating dinner? A judge's probably not gonna dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages right away. To win their case, the customer needs to show that the manager acted with a super bad and on purpose disregard for how his actions would affect people, and that his actions were really, really bad. The customer can argue that the manager should've known how bad it would be not to clean up the spill because lots of other people had slipped and gotten hurt in the store before, and he still did nothing. The customer's argument that the manager's actions were super bad isn't super strong, but it's still kind of reasonable. This is because the store had six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager didn't do anything to make the store safer.\n\nOn October 13th at 5:00 pm, an employee of D&D Markets told the manager, Paul Martin, that there was a big applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin was like, \"I'm on dinner break, I don't have time for customer complaints.\" Fifteen minutes later, another employee told Martin about the spill again, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and hurt her back really badly. Before Palmer got hurt, there were already five other slip-and-fall incidents reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for both regular damages and punitive damages, and we're figuring out whether to ask the judge to throw out the part of the claim about the punitive damages.\n\nIn California, people can get punitive damages if someone broke a law that wasn't related to a contract and acted with a really bad attitude, like being super mean or deceitful. The law says \"malice\" means either doing something on purpose to hurt someone, or doing something really, really bad with a total disregard for other people's rights or safety. Courts have said that it's like when someone knows that their actions are going to hurt people, but they do it anyway because they don't care. That's basically what the teacher in the Taylor case said in 1979.",
            "It's crazy to think it's been almost four years since I took that course on Islam at CBC.  We had this huge debate in class about whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I still think that question is super relevant today, especially considering how media's view on Islam has changed since 9/11.  It's wild to think that back in 2001, we wouldn't have even considered a presidential candidate with a Muslim background like Barack Obama.  \n\nThe Prophet's biography really got me thinking.  I learned in class that Muhammad was supposed to be some kind of conqueror who forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a whole different picture.  It's like, Muhammad comes across as this humble guy who's been misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  People started to see the 'truth' in his teachings and came to him on their own.  That's pretty different from what I thought I knew about him.\n\nWhat's also tripping me out is how similar the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's 'miracles' are.  Like, there's this one story where Muhammad takes some mutton and milk and it's enough for 40 people.  I think the writers wanted to make Muhammad seem like this humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, just lived in truth and did miracles.  That's kinda problematic because it downplays Jesus' life and personhood.  It's like they're stealing from Jesus and trying to pass it off as Muhammad's story.\n\nThere are a lot of stories in the biography that are presented as 'proof' of people converting to Islam on their own, but they're all from third-party sources.  I mean, it's like the author's trying to say 'Hey, I heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so,' and it just doesn't feel real.  It makes me skeptical.\n\nWhat really gets me is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this godly, humble, and wise guy.  But history doesn't back that up, and I wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Looking back, it seems that the teachings and ideas that Jesus lived by got lost in the shuffle when Christianity started evolving after his death.  If we look at Christian history in general, it's clear that it's strayed further and further away from its roots.  It's like the whole world is moving forward with a growing awareness and a trend towards progress, but the traditional folks are still stuck in their ways and resistant to new ideas.  They might not be influential enough to make a huge impact, though.  I think down the line, people will start to become more aware of their Christian history and wonder what the original plans were.  They'll start to figure out which parts of the religion were added over time and what the actual message of Jesus was.  It might take a while - decades or even centuries - but eventually, things will swing back around.  A big shift will happen in Christian history, and we'll move back to the way things were when Jesus first started spreading the word.  Instead of all these added layers of doctrine, we'll strip them away, one by one, until we're back to the basics of what Jesus taught us about God.  When this movement picks up speed in the US and Europe, it'll be like a big wave that sweeps through and changes things.  People will start to worship like we did back in Jesus' day, following what he said and believed.  The church as an institution will stay strong, but it'll lead people back to the basics, not the complicated ideas that have been added over time.  You'll see a big change from all the differences within Christianity to tons of similarities and a more uniform way of thinking.  It's not the first time this has happened, either - think about how the Roman Empire used to persecute Christians, but then they became the Christian empire, or how the US used to have African-American leaders at the bottom of society, but now they're leading the way.  A similar thing is going to happen in Christianity, where people will go back to the source and make things simpler and more unified.  To make all this happen, we need to start seeing Jesus' words as metaphors, not as literal statements.  So, let's go back to the beginning - what was Christianity like back in the day?  If we go way back, we find that it all started with Judaism, which was the core of the Christian faith.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Jewish people already believed in one God, had a revealed religion, and followed the Hebrew scriptures.  But they weren't all on the same page - there were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a bunch of regular folks, all with different ideas.",
            "I think that The Jungle really shows how humans on the inside are pretty selfish and only think about themselves. They just try to make their lives better and don't really care about anyone else. This is super clear in the book when you look at the big factory owners and managers. All they care about is making their companies huge and rich and they don't even think about the people or the planet getting hurt because of it. Upton Sinclair writes some pretty sick stuff, like, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's basically painting a picture of how messed up the pollution is and how the owners don't even care about the animals or people getting hurt. They're all about making a buck, and don't care if it hurts the environment or the people working for them. Sinclair says it pretty bluntly, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". The owners and managers are all about making money, and they'll do whatever it takes to get it. They make people work crazy hours and then just get rid of them when they're not making enough money. Back then, there weren't really any laws to protect workers, so the owners could do whatever they wanted. The people working in the factories and living in Packingtown were basically treated like slaves. There were no organizations helping them or giving them information, and the unions were actually just making money off the poor workers. The workers were basically trapped in this system and were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Sometimes authors really know how to get you to feel a certain way about important stuff. They have a bunch of tricks up their sleeve to do this, and some of them work way better than others. In his book The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald is like a master of these tricks. One of the things he does is pair up words that don't usually go together to make you think about a subject in a certain way. Another thing he does is take a symbol and give it meaning, then use it again to make you feel something specific. Fitzgerald used this last trick with lots of colors, including gold, green, but also white/gray and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up meaning for white/gray and red/pink, then uses that meaning to make you feel a certain way about something important.\n\nFitzgerald makes white/gray into a symbol of something pretty specific: uniformity. White is like, higher class and nicer, while gray is more old and faded. He sets up this meaning at the very beginning of the book by using these colors all the time. Like, Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white, and not just them - everyone's always wearing white: Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is super pale and white. Actually, the only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick's describing Gatsby's party: the halls are all gaudy and bright. Fitzgerald keeps using these colors to describe regular, boring stuff too: as Nick goes to work, he goes down the white canyons of lower New York, the names of people at Gatsby's parties are just gray names on Nick's schedule, Catherine's apartment is just one part of a long row of white apartment buildings, and so on. He even describes plain people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a white girlhood together, there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes, the little Italian kid in the train is gray, and the dog-seller is a gray old man.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald builds up enough meaning with white/gray, he uses them to make you feel like some subjects are unimportant or uniform. This starts with Daisy. After a while without using these colors much, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as wearing white in a little white roadster, and you start to see her as just a uniform thing, something Gatsby wants but isn't really a person. He uses this technique with Daisy a bunch of times to make you feel like she's just a uniform addition, like when there's a gray haze around her fur collar, or when she's wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's big encounter.",
            "San Diego County is super good at growing food, thanks to its awesome weather and lots of sunshine. They grow all sorts of cool stuff like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and even tree fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries and honey are also super popular, and people love getting peppers. There's a huge demand for organic food in the area, and lots of local groups have super long waiting lists for their community-supported agriculture programs. People in San Diego also love buying organic eggs and milk. Many organic farms in the area even let you tour their operations and explore the land for hiking, birdwatching, and other fun stuff. This kind of setup is perfect for farmers who want to get government help while keeping the land healthy and making money through tours and other programs.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming are pretty sweet, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. For one, it takes a lot more work and management to get rid of pests and weeds without using chemicals, and you might lose more crops than with regular farming methods. Small organic farms also can't compete with big operations when it comes to efficiency. To make things better for wildlife, you've got to do things like plant cover crops, help animals move around the land, get rid of invasive species, and make sure the plants have the right conditions to thrive. That's a lot more work and costs more money, so farmers might need some help or expertise to make it all work.\n\nI picked a specific piece of land near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, as my example. It's 160 acres of beautiful chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland, right next to the Cleveland National Forest. This area is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is covered in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan looks at over a hundred different plants and animals, some of which are super endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are in trouble and might be listed as endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nThis land has been home to Native Americans for who-knows-how-long and was later settled by cattle ranchers and people who sold wood in the 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it was probably used for grazing and wood production for a long time. I picked a real piece of property from a website and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might do to make organic farming work and keep the land safe for wildlife. I used a local organic farm in the same area as my example.",
            "Culture is a key factor in any negotiation, but it's often more about what it's not than what it actually is. It's not one-size-fits-all; instead, it's a complex and multifaceted thing that can change from situation to situation. You can't make blanket statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" because they're just too broad and oversimplify things. What's more helpful is understanding how a culture affects the negotiation at hand and how its attitudes might impact the talks. When you deal with a foreign culture, you're bound to compare it to your own, and that's when the real learning happens.\n\nTo get a handle on a different culture, you might need to study its history or learn about its prejudices. The goal is to accept it for what it is, not to judge or try to change it, especially when you're in a weaker bargaining position. If you're negotiating on foreign soil, showing respect for local traditions and customs can be a game-changer. It can help you get past any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nBut culture isn't just about national or international differences; it's also present within companies, too. Corporate culture can vary wildly depending on the company, from super-serious work hours to a more relaxed schedule. You can see evidence of it in things like dress codes, communication styles, and who gets hired. Take American companies, for example - they're all different, even within the same country. And it's not just about big differences between companies; even within the same company, there can be regional and urban/suburban differences. So, it's not always easy to tell what's going on beneath the surface.\n\nWhen it comes to values, that's where things get really important. They're what give a culture its underlying reasons for being. If saving face or community harmony is a big deal in a culture, you can bet that a negotiator won't go out of their way to shame their company or boss in public. And if a culture values getting a hard bargain, they won't be in a rush to settle just to get a deal done. Knowing these things can help you prepare for a negotiation, but it's also a good idea to get to know your opponent on a personal level to really make the negotiation work.",
            "\"The fool has said, 'There is no God.' This quote from Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible is also the starting point for St. Anselm's argument on God's existence and is found in the beginning of his reasoning. It's interesting to note that Thomas Aquinas seems to hold a similar view as well. Since we're about to discuss both of their arguments, which are basically about the same thing, we'll assume they're both right about the existence of God - the God of the Bible. If we consider a different version of God, it would be hard to compare their arguments because they're more or less just trying to prove the existence of the one in the Bible. I think what I'm getting at is that while both of them make some solid points, neither one really does a complete job of proving God's existence.\n\nLet's take a look at St. Anselm's argument first. Anselm basically says that to find out about God, you can look inside yourself. He says that because we already know God exists in our minds, it's impossible to imagine a world without him. When you break it down, he's saying that you don't need any outside evidence to prove God's existence - it's all about what you already know inside your head. This idea is often called faith, which means accepting something without all the facts. It's a pretty different approach from what St. Thomas Aquinas is saying.\n\nSt. Thomas thinks that you can use logic and evidence to prove God's existence without relying on faith. This would be super helpful for spreading Christianity because it would make it easier to convince new people to join without them having to believe something without proof. He's got five different logical arguments to back this up: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. What he's basically saying is that you can use logic to figure out that God exists, even if you can't see him. For example, imagine if someone told you that you're missing a puzzle piece, and you put all the others together - you can still figure out what the missing piece looks like without actually seeing it.",
            "It's a pretty weird feeling thinking that around 2,500 years ago or so, a prince would grow up to become the Buddha. I guess this guy would ditch the whole royalty thing and find enlightenment, which, in turn, led to the creation of Buddhism. The most traditional branch of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. I'm pretty sure it's changed a lot since the Buddha's time, though. You can see the difference in a place like Sri Lanka, where they have this wacky water-cutting ceremony. Everyone, monks and regular people alike, participate in it, and it's got some meaning, even though the Buddha never talked about it. These differences are all over the place, from the silly traditions to the deeper stuff that makes up the core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to modify its main ideas over time, both on its own and due to external influences. Sometimes these changes come from people who don't believe in Buddhism, but other times they come from within the community itself.\n\nYou might hear some new terms in this discussion, so let's define them. An internal force refers to something that comes from within the Buddhist community, while an external force is something from outside. A hostile force is anything that harms the Buddhist community, while a benign force doesn't try to hurt or help, even if it ends up doing one or the other by accident. These terms will pop up a lot in what I'm about to say.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the basics of Theravada Buddhism – the core stuff that makes it tick. Buddhists put their trust in three key things: the Buddha, the Dhamma (which is essentially all the Buddhist texts), and the Sangha (the community). The Dhamma is made up of three main parts – the Tripitaka – which includes the Sutta Pitaka (all the Suttas), the Vinaya Pitaka (the rules of conduct), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the metaphysical stuff). The metaphysical stuff covers ideas like there's no permanent soul, life is full of suffering, and nothing lasts forever. If you can wrap your head around these concepts, you can break free from this cycle of death and rebirth. Along with that, you'll also kick the habit of desiring stuff, hating things, and being delusional. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for life, with five precepts for regular people (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't be all weird about sex, and don't get drunk) and a bunch more rules for monks. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, life is suffering; second, attachments cause suffering; and third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico have a pretty wild history that dates back to 1836 and lasted 57 years, from then to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p.145).  The craziest part of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US took down Mexico and got its hands on Texas and the American Southwest.  There were other smaller skirmishes between the two nations, but the fighting finally died down just before the First World War.  It all started because Americans and Mexicans had major disagreements about stuff like religion, culture, and stuff they thought was important, and they also had huge differences over what they wanted to gain. (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  \n\nThis rivalry thing isn't unique to the US and Mexico, by the way.  Lots of countries that share borders have clashes of interests that lead to them becoming rivals.  The US and Mexico aren't that different from other countries like this.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can you find long-lasting American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  Both of these countries are right next to the US and have been at odds with it, while other Latin American countries get along pretty well with the US.  \n\nReligious differences caused a huge rift between the US and Mexico, and this is something that's happened to a lot of other countries too.  Sally Frahm (2001) said that \"if Americans were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century, in the 18th and 19th they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86).  It's kinda like how the Cold War was a mix of ideological struggles and competing interests, but in this case, it was more about the US and Mexico having different ideas about what was important.  This distrust started because the US and Mexico inherited it from their former colonial rulers - the English and Spanish.  This made it tough for the two countries to have a good relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) counted 17 disputes between the US and Mexico during the 57-year rivalry period.  Most of these disputes were about border stuff, like bandits and outlaws crossing the border and causing trouble.  It wasn't until both countries started using military force to control their borders that things started to calm down (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) said the rivalry started to fade away as \"Mexico became dependent on the US in a big way\" (p. 109) and eventually ended when American ambitions changed from trying to take over land to trying to influence Mexico's economy (p.110) in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I hit rock bottom after a mysterious illness left me disabled and unable to work. At the time, I was a nurse with a dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, but life had other plans. People kept telling me, \"You'll always find a job; people will always get sick,\" so I chose nursing as a secure career choice. Little did I know that my security would soon be turned upside down.\n\nFast forward to my life at 46: I'm single, broke, and living on disability checks. I've lost count of the days when I thought I had nothing left to call my own. Every day is a struggle to survive, and my self-esteem takes a hit. But one thing I know for sure is that I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few true friends. When disaster strikes, you realize how fragile you are, and how much you need the help of others.\n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies – big and small. No matter how prepared you are, some things are just too big to handle on your own. So, let's stop relying solely on the government to save us and start building a safety net of our own. Instead of bailing out to build our own fallout shelters, let's learn to trust each other and ask for help when we need it.\n\nThe Conservatives talk about rugged individualism, but it was actually community and compassion that kept our ancestors going in tough times. The pioneers who trekked across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it by going it alone – they relied on each other for support.\n\nSo, be prepared, but don't forget the importance of community. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a stash of canned goods, but I also try to know my neighbors and look out for them. It's time for us to stop relying solely on ourselves and start building a network of people who will help each other out when things get tough.",
            "It's still a mystery why organisms evolve the way they do. There are probably some rules or boundaries that determine which way they change over time. Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson pointed out that biologists are still pretty clueless about describing the simplest living things in math terms. But more recently, math has been used to figure out how certain types of animals build their shells over time, like the way they grow and develop (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study is working on using math to understand how animals like the ones in the Prunum family grow their shells and change over time. We're combining math with experiments to see what makes some of these animals change in certain ways. We looked at X-ray pictures of different Prunum species and used the information to create math models of their shells. These models helped us see what their shells could look like if they changed in different ways. Now we're combining these models with our experiments to learn more about how these animals evolved over time.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that moves through space over time. It's like a big spiral that goes around in a circle, and each part of the spiral is called a whorl. The middle of the shell is like an imaginary stick that runs through the middle of the spiral. This stick is called the columella. The speed at which the spiral grows can change, and the lines that separate each whorl are called sutures. Most shells have a big spiral at the end, which is called the body whorl. The rest of the spiral is called the spire. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nYou can look at a shell from different angles, like looking at the top, bottom, front, or back. Most people look at shells with the front side facing them and the top pointing up. \n\nThere's a way to count the whorls on a shell. First, look at the shell from the top and find the first line where the whorls start to separate. Then draw a line to divide the shell in two. Count the whorls from this line, and you can even estimate a quarter of a whorl if you need to.\n\nA shell is like a series of holes that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. You can follow the path of the holes by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. This path can be drawn and mathematically explained. Once you have the math formula, you can change the rules and see how the animal's shell changes.",
            "It's been a decade since Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have changed much.  Even though the country is doing pretty well in achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals, like getting clean water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health is nowhere near what it needs to be to reach its targets by 2015.  In the next few sections, I'll be talking about the reasons behind this lack of improvement, and you'll see why Indonesia needs to focus on strengthening its healthcare system rather than just working on individual programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress in getting skilled workers at births, with 72% of births now getting this kind of care.  But this number is a bit misleading since it includes traditional workers like midwives who can't provide medical help if a pregnancy gets complicated - which is why a lot of maternal deaths are due to hemorrhage.  Additionally, there's been a drop in the percentage of kids under five who get treated by a health professional for diarrhea, and the data on post-natal care is pretty incomplete, but it's clear that it's a big problem all over the country.\n\nC-section rates are still pretty low at 4%, and that's got some major implications.  The rate is 7% in cities, but only 2% in rural areas, which shows that healthcare services are mostly focused on city areas.  There's also a huge gap in access to healthcare between the richest and poorest families - 27% to be exact.  This means the poor are having a hard time getting the care they need, probably because they can't afford it.\n\nSo, the big question is how to make things better, starting with getting more healthcare services available.  Should Indonesia focus on developing special programs or just making the overall healthcare system stronger?  It's clear that special programs can get fast results, but they also have some big drawbacks.  One problem is that when you invest a lot in one area, other areas might get left behind.  Another issue is that all these separate programs can get really confusing and make a lot of extra paperwork.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate details and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  Two novels that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Instead of following the typical Victorian style, these novels incorporate a sense of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which helps to deepen our understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions. These atypical elements give us insight into their inner workings, making them feel more real and relatable.\n\nAs Fagin's character in Oliver Twist was walking between Sikes and Crackit, arguing, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was still there; the words they were saying echoed in his mind, and when he snapped out of it, he found himself talking to them.  Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire and was whisked away by an unseen force.  Through this disorienting experience, a nagging sense of pain lingered, wearing him down and tormenting him.\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests itself through dream sequences or dreamlike states.  In Oliver Twist, these bizarre events give us a glimpse into Oliver's inner world, revealing what hurts him and how he perceives the events unfolding around him.  When Oliver is shot in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if it's a dream, while struggling to find help.  The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over his situation, as well as his dire circumstances, which is evident in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses, and he feels his despair wash over him again, this time laced with fear rather than surprise.  With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises as to who is responsible for his misfortune, since it certainly wasn't him.  This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his life, and that he's unable to even attempt to take charge of an event's outcome, even when his life is on the line.  A growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and lose his ability to react.\n\nThe day after the shooting passed quickly – it was over before it began – and night fell again, a long and dreadful silence that seemed to last forever, yet was over in what felt like an instant.",
            "A couple years back, I worked with a pretty cool after-school program where I helped Elementary school kids with their homework and whatever they were struggling with in class. My thing was reading and English, though. One of the instructors asked me to work with a little dude named Adrian, who was having a super tough time reading. I figured something was up; it was weird because he knew some letters super well, but others were a total mystery to him. I'm pretty sure he was of Latin background, and he spoke English like a pro, but I was still confused. We struggled through that until the day I met his mom. I was hanging out with him while the rest of the group went on a field trip, and his mom showed up. She only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish skills are basically non-existent, but we managed to communicate somehow. It hit me like a ton of bricks then: Adrian could totally read, but he just didn't know the English alphabet super well. I don't know if that realization helped him much, but I hope he's doing way better now.\n\nI'm telling this story because it highlights the problem of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as it seems, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can be super tough for them too. We all agree that this is a problem, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: just some extra tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciation. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of these things alone will fix it. We need to combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is actually a pretty great idea, not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. Apparently, kids in two-way bilingual education programs do way better in school. A lot of people freak out about this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we made this the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from it. So how do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's a bit unrealistic. What we could do is have special bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to help out.",
            "Most of us are told from a young age that there's something greater than us out there - something we can't fully comprehend. Some of us attend Sunday school, others go to Temple, and some search within themselves for answers. Many of us stick to the faith passed down by our parents, but some of us reject it entirely, thinking there's nothing beyond what we can see in our own little world. We might change our minds and try a different value system later on. Whatever path we choose, we're on a journey to figure out who we are based on our own unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us out of the dark and into the light.\n\nMy dad told me that cardinals are his favorite bird when I asked. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain pounding on the tin roof, the sound echoing off the wet plants by the edge of the porch. He was staring out into the rain, a look that was both searching and remembering. He'd lost a lot of weight lately, and his old clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair was thinner, too. I felt scared and alone, and I didn't know how to talk to him about how much I'd miss him without making it too real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nThat was the last time I saw my dad. He passed away in December, just five days before my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation hadn't made him feel better, but had kept him alive for a few more months longer than the doctors said he'd make it. I wondered what the point was in suffering so long if it didn't get any easier. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago. I didn't say any prayers that night because I didn't want to ask for anything. I just wanted to remember my dad the way he was, not the way he left.\n\nI didn't watch him die because I couldn't bear to see the person who made me leave this life behind. I wanted to remember him for who he was, not how he went. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. I curled up in a ball in bed for three days, waiting for the news. No one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is a bit of an irony, an oxymoron combining \"old\" and \"new,\" as Ian Watt so cleverly points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. Throughout history, the Gothic mode has been praised and bashed, with some people thinking it's all superficial and others finding depth in its \"terrible sublime\" qualities (Burke). When Horace Walpole created the original \"Gothic Novel,\" The Castle of Otranto, he mixed elements from ancient romances and modern novels to invent a fresh way of writing. He called it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew inspiration from medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, even though it was initially seen as old-fashioned or unsophisticated compared to the modern world. The blend of the theatrical and the new format of the novel, which lets readers see the characters' inner thoughts, is what made Gothic novels last and stay relevant, becoming both outdated and new to readers from different time periods.\n\nOne of the key Gothic ideas is the concept of Chivalry. In The Castle of Otranto, the medieval idea of chivalry, which was meant to create a proper knight, was taken and transformed. Chivalry was important to Gothic writers because it represented the ideal knight – brave, honorable, and competent – and they saw a lack of those qualities in their own time. By using chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" was idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the future of Gothic to Romantic) and used to try to improve the present. When Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto, he was living through a tumultuous time and was worried about the future. Feeling let down by politics and unfairly accused, he might have thought that the supposed good nature of people in the gothic era was lost in modern society. This idea is clear in characters like Frederic, who's described as:\n\nThe description of Frederic includes many chivalric images; he's a prince who's suffered, been affected by tragedy, and supposedly killed by infidels. This exaggerated portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" introduces the Gothic trope of excess, which will become a recurring theme (66).",
            "So, you want to know about supply chain management? It's basically the whole process of getting stuff from the person who wants it (the customer) all the way back to the raw materials that make it. It's like a big chain of events that happens really fast. The term supply chain management was invented by Keith Oliver back in 1982. He said it's all about planning, implementing, and controlling the whole process so you can satisfy customers quickly and efficiently. There are six main parts to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give the best customer service ever.\n\nProduction is the very first step in the process. It's like the foundation of the whole thing. You need to figure out when, why, where, and how you're going to make the stuff. To do that, you have to know what the customer wants, so you look at the market. The market is like a big indicator of what people are into. Once you know what they want, you can decide what to make and how much of it. After that, you figure out where to make it and which factory is best for quality and quantity. You also have to make sure the customer is happy, or else it's all pointless.\n\nThe next step is scheduling work and taking care of the equipment. This is super important because if you don't plan everything out, it can cost you a lot of time and money in the long run. I know this from my old job at Wal-Mart and Target. We had a super specific plan for everything, from how the uniforms looked to when the shipments came in. It made everything run smoothly and nobody got confused.\n\nThe second key element is supply. This is all about deciding what you're good at and who you should partner with. Let's say you make a bunch of different products and each one needs a different setup. You have to decide which one is best for each part of the process. You might even outsource some of the work to other companies to save time and money. The goal is to be fast and flexible while keeping costs low.",
            "I was walking down the street the other day and saw this crazy sign being held by Ellen Page, star of Juno. It read, \"Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\" I thought it was pretty wild. Burma, or Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia where the government is super strict. They took over in 1962 after a big power struggle. Last year, the people there started protesting, led by monks who wore these orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution, and at first, the government was kinda cool with it, but things quickly escalated into a full-blown conflict. The military started attacking the monks and their monasteries, and anyone who was seen as a threat was arrested or worse. Foreign journalists were even killed, like this Japanese dude named Kenji Nagai. We're not even sure how many people died, but some reports say thousands.\n\nThis isn't new, though. Governments have been trying to shut down dissent for ages. The ancient Romans thought their emperors were gods, and the Japanese still think their emperors are, like, actual gods. Our current president talks to some crazy dude named Ted Haggard, who's like, the leader of some super right-wing group. It's like, what's the difference between them and the Chinese government, which killed all these people in Tiananmen Square in '89? The official story says a few hundred died, but other reports say it was way more, like 2,000-3,000. And then there was the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia groups killed all these Tutsis and moderates. Hitler's whole \"Third Reich\" thing was pretty much the same deal.",
            "Duke Ellington’s impact on jazz is super big because he was around for so long and was so creative with his orchestra. Some of his songs, like the ones for this project, don't even have him on the piano, but as a composer, Ellington was a master at writing music that made each band member shine. He created this framework where soloists could just go wild and improvise, and at the same time, he'd write pieces that highlighted each band member's style. This way, he made the whole orchestra sound super cool and original. Ellington was also really good at understanding how each player sounded alone, and how they fit together in the group, which allowed him to write some of the most genius and amazing jazz pieces ever.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about how Ellington used voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in his whole career, and it's a good example of this in his song Creole Love Call. It's a slow, bluesy piece where he used voice to add some extra texture and color, without even needing lyrics. This song also shows how Ellington was great at making his soloists sound awesome, which he did in a lot of his music. The song has six different parts, and each one is like a mini-story. \n\nChorus 1: It starts with the voice and the reeds talking to each other, with the voice being super smooth and melodic at first, but then getting a bit rougher at the end.\nChorus 2: Then there's a muted trumpet solo that takes the basic melody and makes it sound even better, with some extra notes that make it sound really cool.\nChorus 3: After that, there's a clarinet solo that's super fast and high-pitched, with a piano phrase that's really funky.\nChorus 4: The next part is like a big echo of the first chorus, but with the brass and reed sections talking to each other.\nChorus 5: The final part is the most intense, with the reeds starting to talk back, and the brass section making some really cool rhythms.\nChorus 6: The last part goes back to the first chorus, but this time the voice is using a special technique called the \"growl\" to sound like it's playing an instrument.\nThe last part is just a quick tag with a vocal run and some weird, dissonant sounds from a trombone.\n\nThis is just one example of how Ellington used voice to add some extra flavor to his music. In his song Hot and Bothered, he combines his skill at making the orchestra sound tight with his ear for making sounds that sound really cool. In that song, he has a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, where they use both vocal and instrumental parts to make something really rich and cool. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) takes this idea even further, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone, and it sounds amazing.",
            "I've had this thing inside me for a while now - this feeling that something's missing. It started when I was 14, right when I was getting into the whole teenage scene. Now I'm 17, and it's still there. I've come to realize I'm looking for someone, not just something, but I just can't seem to find anyone I'm into. Some guys have tried to get my attention, and they've all gone through the usual awkward stages, but none of them have been able to hold my interest. I've spent years trying to figure out what's going on with this, and I've come up with a bunch of ideas, but nothing that really makes sense. So I just keep living life, still trying to figure it out.\n\nAt home, things are pretty chill. My parents are super laid-back and rarely argue about anything. The only times they do get into a fight are when they disagree with my independent streak. I'm the calm and collected daughter of two super mellow parents, but I'm like the complete opposite - I'm all about living life to the fullest and being true to myself. But today was different. I was walking around the house trying to find some new ideas, when I heard my mom let out a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. I ran in there, freaking out, and saw my mom on the ground, clearly in agony. She was saying \"Ow\" over and over, and I knew I had to act fast. I rushed to her side and helped her up. She told me to take her to the hospital - I could tell she was in a lot of pain. I got her to the car and drove her there myself.\n\nWhen we got to the hospital, the smell of disinfectant and sickness hit me, but I was too worried about my mom to feel scared. I helped her onto a rolling bed and called for the doctors. They took her in right away, and I was left sitting there, worried sick.\n\nApparently, my mom had slipped off a stool while trying to grab a vase from the top shelf. I was relieved when the doctors took her in and started checking her out. Now I'm just waiting and hoping everything turns out okay.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high score on the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\" scale, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet that consists of higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and monounsaturated fats, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate amounts of alcohol are allowed.\n\nPast studies showed that following the Med diet was associated with a lower risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and an intervention study found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, these previous studies didn't focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study involved 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years old, who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a research project following 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The authors calculated the aMed diet score six times from 1984 to 2004 using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" that assessed participants' nutrient intake during the previous year. More than 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year study period. These questionnaires were validated through other studies. The researchers verified reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke by reviewing medical records, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records weren't available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the study, with around 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. Age, smoking status, body mass index, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each questionnaire, and starting in 1986, the participants' leisure-time physical activity was also evaluated.\n\nTo reduce random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, the researchers averaged together the aMed scores from repeated questionnaires over time (averaging scores from two prior years). The study adjusted for potential \"confounders\" (factors that could affect the results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study found that a higher aMed diet score was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in the women. Over the course of 20 years, the researchers identified 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women who scored highest on the aMed diet were less likely to experience both CHD and stroke compared to those who scored lowest (with a relative risk of 0.71).",
            "So, let's talk about this super crazy financial crisis that hit the United States back in 2007. It was like, a total nightmare – unemployment went up, the housing market went down, and all these huge corporations were left in shambles. We're still dealing with the aftermath, so it's time to figure out what happened and how to stop it from happening again. In a nutshell, the financial crisis was caused by some pretty selfish and clueless politicians who pushed banks and companies to give out these sketchy sub-prime loans to people who couldn't really afford them. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were forced to buy up and package these bad loans into these super complex financial things called CDOs and CDSs. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were like, \"uh-oh, we don't have enough money!\" and they tried to pawn off the problem onto these repackaged mortgages they'd already sold, and then onto the rest of the economy.\n\nIt all started back in 1999 when Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he relaxed some lending rules, which set the stage for this whole sub-prime mess that happened seven years later. Steven Holmes from the New York Times was like a total genius and predicted this whole thing would go down. He said, \"Hey, Fannie Mae is under pressure from the government to give out more loans to low-income people, and also from its stockholders who just want more profits.\" And then he nailed it: \"But if there's an economic downturn, Fannie Mae will be in big trouble and the government will have to bail it out, just like they did with the savings and loan industry in the 80s.\" Yeah, that's exactly what happened.\n\nA bunch of other factors contributed to the economy going haywire. There were all these new, super complicated mortgage things like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs that tied up the whole economy with the housing market. This made households and financial markets super vulnerable to even small changes in housing prices. And, well, the housing bubble burst, and all these financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were like, \"Oh no, what do we do?\" The top five investment banks were stuck with $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which is like, a huge chunk of the USA's GDP. In the end, some of these banks got sold for a steal, while others got dismantled or forced to become \"normal\" banks with lots of rules to follow. Fannie and Freddie were in huge trouble too, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and the government had to step in and take control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition - the villain of the writer's world.  It's that part in your story where you try to take off like a superhero, but end up face-planting into a pool of boring text that puts your readers to sleep or makes them vow to never come back to your site.  I know Dr. Merlin has been known to scream at her computer when she gets stuck in Exposition Limbo, and not in the cool, edgy way.\n\nExposition is the nemesis that every writer needs to conquer.  Even if you know the \"Show, don't tell\" rule, you're still likely to find yourself stuck in a sea of unnecessary details that don't move the plot forward.\n\nExposition is when you dump a ton of backstory, history, or info onto your readers without giving them a chance to breathe.  It's like the character in your story telling another character their entire life story in one breath - as seen in those epic tales like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, it's you, the author, doing the telling instead.\n\nTo illustrate this, imagine reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved at a certain time and place, gets married in style, and then has her husband brutally murdered in front of her.  You wouldn't expect this whole sequence to take two whole pages, right?  And you certainly wouldn't expect the husband and wife to only get two lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to spend some quality time developing the husband's character, showing how much he loves his wife through his words and actions, and revealing how she's changed and grown because of him.  This would make his death even more impactful and your connection to the heroine deeper.\n\nIn short, you'd want to add some meat to the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  As a writer, it's your job to provide that meat.  Sometimes it's tempting to rush through certain parts, but don't be tempted - give your readers what they want and need to care about your story.",
            "I just watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about some serious stuff in Ashley, Ohio - a dude named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. They only showed a quick bit on this, like two minutes, 'cause it was still developing. All they said was that he had stabbed her multiple times and got arrested. I think they handled it pretty fairly. \n\tNext up was a story about a shooting in Sharon Woods. Some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot, but they didn't have any suspects or arrests. The SWAT team was investigating. This story felt kinda short, and I think it might've been because the victim was a black kid from a black neighborhood. I've noticed this pattern before - when a minority gets hurt, the media usually doesn't give it much airtime. But if a white person gets hurt, it's huge news. \n\tThe next story was about a Med-Flight helicopter getting a .22 caliber bullet hole in it. They said they think it happened somewhere specific, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-grand reward for any tips that help catch the shooter. \n\tThen there was a story about some rain and thunderstorms coming on Saturday. They said the weekend was gonna be in the mid-to-low eighties, but it was a pretty short clip - I think they just wanted to keep us watching. \n\tThey also did a piece on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. They said the perp was a dark-skinned black guy wearing a hoodie, and they spent a weird amount of time emphasizing how dark he was. \n\tLastly, they had a story about Rene Rodriguez, a Texas dude who was convicted of running a big marijuana operation from Texas to Ohio. He got sentenced to 300 months in prison, which I thought was a weird way to say 25 years. They also mentioned he's Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant.",
            "There's a bond between brothers that's like a fortress, unbreakable and unshakable. It's a bond that holds a bunch of complicated emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. When you have a brother, you kinda get them, you know? They're like a mirror image of yourself, and they can only see themselves when they look at you. But it's when things get really tough that you find out what's really going on in that bond. It's then that you see the good and the bad, and it's not always easy to deal with. When you can look a brother in the eye and see your own reflection staring back at you, you're forced to confront who you really are and what you're really made of. It's in their actions and the consequences of those actions that you see what someone's really like. This theme is explored in \"The Scarlet Ibis\", where two brothers are on a wild adventure that goes totally wrong. Their journey is like a rollercoaster of emotions, with bitter disappointment and intense pride clashing in the end. Only one of them gets out alive, but the other brother's spirit lives on.\n\nThe story is all about how one brother feels, especially about pride. He's got this huge ego and he wants his little brother, Doodle, to be someone he can teach all the cool stuff to, like how to hold his breath and run fast. But Doodle's got a weak heart, and it's like his whole dream is crushed. The big brother's got a mix of emotions, from anger to love, and it's hard to say which one's stronger. He even thinks about doing something crazy, but when Doodle smiles, he starts to feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It shows that deep down, he really loves his little bro. The story's all about how this complicated bond between brothers works, and how it can drive you crazy, but also how it can be super strong.",
            "So, the brain is basically a super cool, super advanced machine that can do all sorts of crazy stuff. As technology has gotten better and better, people have come up with new ways to describe how the brain works. At first, it was like a piece of wax, then a scroll, then a book, and now it's like a super powerful computer. However, these comparisons aren't perfect and can sometimes lead to wrong conclusions.\n\nSo, let's start with the basics. The brain takes in information from our senses, which turn things like touch, sound, and light into electrical signals. It then processes this info in two different ways: bottom-up and top-down. Think of bottom-up like putting together a puzzle – it starts with simple pieces of info like color, shape, and edges, and then puts them together to figure out what you're seeing. Top-down is like using what you already know to help you make sense of things faster. For example, if you see a picture of a black box on a white background, top-down processing can help you figure out it's a box, not a hole in the background.\n\nOnce the brain has processed some info, it decides which signals are important and sends them to the right places. It's like having a filter that says, \"Hey, don't worry about those individual blades of grass, but let's pay attention to your name when someone says it really loudly.\" There are lots of steps to processing, and attention plays a big role in deciding what's important and what's not.\n\nBut before the brain can process info, it has to store it somehow. There are different kinds of memory, like short-term and long-term, and they work in different ways. When we first get info, it gets encoded, or put into the brain in a way that makes sense. This encoding depends on what kind of info it is – like how words look, sound, or mean. Once it's stored, the brain has to keep it around. Scientists think that short-term memory might be like a temporary electrical signal, while long-term memory is stored in special proteins.\n\nThere are all sorts of theories about how the brain organizes information. Some are based on how people remember things, some on computer science, and some on brain science. One cool theory is the semantic network, where ideas are connected to each other like a web. For example, the idea of a \"chair\" is linked to a \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of both technology and the capitalistic system that supports it in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this world, people are conditioned to prioritize community and instant happiness above all else. The citizens are basically pawns in a larger game, forced to conform to the World Controller's ideology. By looking at the book through a Marxist lens, you can see that Huxley is basically saying that this is a bad idea. He uses words and ideas from Marxism, like homogeny and reification, to show that he thinks this system is messed up.\n\nThe way Huxley uses satire to criticize capitalism is pretty cool. He's talking about something called false consciousness, which is like when people don't know how they're really connected to the people around them, especially in terms of money. In Brave New World, people are so focused on their own stuff that they can't see the bigger picture. The World Controller is basically controlling everyone, making them think that all they need to do is consume and indulge in stuff. This is super obvious in how the lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are controlled through hypnopædia. They don't really have any control over their own lives. They're just following what they're told. This is basically an example of hegemony, which is when a group of people is controlled by a smaller group of people. The people in control are the ones who get to decide what's best for everyone else, and the lower classes just go along with it. They're basically buying into this system that's set up to keep them down.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are really superficial. People don't really care about each other, they just care about how they look and what they can get out of each other. It's like Huxley is saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and their ability to be themselves. Love and strong emotions don't exist in this world, and people are just going through the motions. The way the characters interact with each other is really shallow, like when the guys talk about the women just because of how they look, or when the women talk about their shallow relationships. This is all a commentary on how people are just following the rules and not really thinking for themselves. They're all just going along with what the system tells them to do, which is basically a Marxist idea about how the working class is brainwashed into thinking they're better than everyone else as long as they keep consuming and following the rules.",
            "I've been attending University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters, and navigating the campus can be a real pain. Like many others, I've had my share of struggles getting around. During my freshman year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room, basically as far east as you can get on campus, except for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It would take me up to 25 minutes to get to places like Willard building near the center of campus on foot, especially when the weather was bad, which it often is in State College. I talked to an alum who's only a bit older than me, and they told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by huge empty spaces. Now those areas are filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, getting from one place to another is becoming more and more of a challenge. On a college campus, the best solution to this problem is the humble bicycle. But just having a bike isn't enough; students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently talked to a friend who got back into biking after a few years off, and he said it's crazy he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for you, it's also super efficient. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergrads, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest move I made this year was buying a bike. Every day I have class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with my bike, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always the easiest road to navigate, bike or not. There are some good things about walking too, but personally, I don't have time for it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take me an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week, which is just too much time to waste."
