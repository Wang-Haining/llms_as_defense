            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I'm planning on pursuing a degree in social work with the ultimate goal of working for the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can help kids who've been mistreated or neglected and support families in need. Some values that'll guide me in this career path are service, respect, and being committed to improving relationships between people and myself. I genuinely believe that these values aren't just crucial for social workers, but also for me as a person.\n\nGrowing up, I've always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which path to take. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed a lot of people running away from their problems and some using less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. I wanted to make a change, so I decided to major in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still unsure of my future. One summer, I met a sixteen-year-old kid who had come to my friend's place to escape his abusive home life. The next day, he called the cops, so I went to his house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and explained my concerns, telling them about my degree in Psychology. They asked me to talk to the parents, and when I did, they seemed pretty nervous and made excuses for their son's behavior. That experience made me realize that I really want to work in social work, helping families like that one.\n\nAnother important value for social work is social justice. We claim that everyone's an individual, but in reality, we're all about following the crowd. If we mourn people who are different, then why do we try to fit in? I'm all about being myself and not limiting myself to what others think is normal. I've always stood up for what I believe in – like when I colored my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that express me, got my ears pierced, joined the GSBA, and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fighting for it.",
            "This paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on genetic information passed down through heredity and medical factors affecting health, while the sociocultural model examines environmental connections and their effects on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. Our review explores these models and digs into the research chosen to better understand and explain them. A critique of the research and its findings highlights their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental health issue, or a sleep disorder stemming from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders tied to another mental disorder are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulties maintaining adequate or quality sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. The sociocultural implications of these disorders are vast, as they can significantly impact daily life, including work, education, and routine tasks.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited factors, and physical aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. When the GABAA receptor is activated, it promotes sleep, while inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. An issue or absence with this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. The sociocultural significance of this study lies in the potential genetic inheritance of the receptor, which could naturally regulate sleep and disrupt it if altered. This can have far-reaching consequences for daily life, including school, work, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This paper explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects how the brain processes sound. First, we'll define CAPD and explain what it means for people who have it. Then, we'll discuss the signs that point to a diagnosis of CAPD, known as \"red flags\". Lastly, we'll talk about ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can help a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD is a disorder where the brain doesn't work properly when it comes to processing sound. It's not about being deaf or hearing impaired, but about the brain not being able to separate sounds or filter out background noise like it should. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain has trouble translating what they hear into something that makes sense.\n\nThe idea of CAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers started studying kids with communication problems. In 1954, a team in Italy was already developing tests for these kids, and by 1961, a scientist named Kimura came up with a way to understand how the brain processes multiple sounds at once. A big conference in 1977 got everyone talking about CAPD and sparked more research.\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble in different areas, like not being able to tell where sounds are coming from or hearing two sounds at the same time. They might have trouble recognizing patterns, like when someone's voice changes or when sounds get mixed up. They might even have trouble figuring out the order of sounds. Other issues include trouble with understanding sarcasm, getting stuck on one sound while another sound is playing, or making sense of sound clues.\n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors use a mix of observing how they behave and testing their hearing skills. This can involve questionnaires, watching how they respond to different sounds, and more in-depth tests that record how the ear responds to sound. Unfortunately, there's no one test that works perfectly for everyone, and there's no known cause for CAPD. Some tests give people a bunch of sounds at once and ask them to pick out certain ones, while others use special equipment to see how the ear responds to sound signals.",
            "It seems like the play Twelfth Night says that using disguises can be super helpful in keeping a secret for a long time, but in the end, you're gonna have to give it up or risk losing yourself in the process. The thing is, it's really hard to stop deceiving people without hurting those around you. Some might not even care that you lied, but others can get pretty mad when they find out. So, it's like, you have to choose between keeping your own identity or keeping your friends and family on your side.  In Twelfth Night, the whole thing with disguising yourself as the opposite gender gets even more complicated because it brings up a lot of other questions. For example, why do people feel like they need to change who they really are just to fit in? In Viola's case, she's just trying to protect herself from bad stuff, so she pretends to be a guy. And it works at first, but it also cuts her off from the people who could help her.\n\nAs Viola is trying to avoid getting hurt, she becomes so good at pretending that Olivia starts to think she's actually a guy named Sebastian, and falls in love with her. Viola's also dealing with some weird feelings for Orsino, who's also into her, but thinks she's a boy. I guess this might seem progressive, but it's kinda like Twelfth Night is saying that deception can help people figure out their real feelings. Like, maybe Olivia and Orsino are hiding some stuff about themselves that Viola/Cesario makes them face. For instance, is Olivia into Cesario because he's a guy, or is she actually into girls in secret? I don't think it's the second one, because Olivia's character seems to be making fun of people who judge others based on looks. We can tell because Olivia goes from having a crush on Cesario to thinking of him as her brother in, like, two seconds.",
            "People have noticed that German colonial rule was pretty brutal, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocides in German South West Africa. But let's be real, it's hard to sum up an entire colonial empire with just a few words. German colonial rule was super varied, both in terms of its policies and how it was run, and it covered a huge amount of different geography. When it comes to education, the German colonies were all over the place, too. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a bunch of super smart and literate Africans. German eduction efforts in places like Kamerun and other colonies even got some good reviews from people writing back then. \n\nBut South West Africa (now Namibia) was a different story altogether. Unlike in East Africa, where the government was all about setting up schools and educating the locals, in South West Africa, the job of educating the natives was pretty much left to missionary groups that didn't have much support from the government. That being said, the government did invest a lot in educating Europeans in the colony and even supported missionary schools more. These educational policies had some long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule was over. Meanwhile, other German colonies had a bunch of literate and educated Africans, but in South West Africa, the majority of the population was basically untouched and illiterate. There were a bunch of social, economic, and political factors that contributed to this different experience. This paper is trying to explore those factors and dive deeper into how settlers and colonial officials felt about native Africans.\n\nThere's a whole lot of research on education in the German colonial empire, but most of it is in German and from the early 20th century. These early studies mostly focused on describing the educational systems in the colonies. Later, more English-language studies came out that compared education in the different German colonies and got into the nitty-gritty details. These studies showed just how different the educational systems were in each colony. The most important study on this topic is probably Cohen's look at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compared the two colonies and figured out what made their educational systems so different. He thinks it's because South West Africa had a big settler population, which made their education system unique.\n\nCompared to the other colonies, South West Africa had a pretty mild climate, except for all the desert. This made it a more comfortable place for Europeans to live, which is why there were almost 15,000 of them there by 1913. In contrast, only 5,336 settlers lived in the next biggest colony, East Africa.",
            "There are so many genres of popular music now that it's a real challenge to make a definitive list. It gets even worse because even the main genres like rock, country, and jazz have tons of sub-genres within them. Heavy Metal, which started about 40 years ago, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. It's diverse because it can express a wide range of emotions, mostly on the darker side. And when people first started messing around with it, they realized just how flexible it was and started creating their own sub-genres, which just kept branching out even more. Today it's tough to figure out what heavy metal even is because there are so many different niches, and it's incorporated ideas from other genres. To understand heavy metal today, you have to understand what it's all about and why it's a movement and not just a genre.\n\nHeavy metal is basically a movement all about darkness. It's like the ultimate \"more-is-better\" thing – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more showmanship. And it's not just about raw emotion; the musicians in metal bands know their stuff and it shows in their music. Another cool thing about heavy metal is that it's heavily influenced by psychedelic substances. The psychedelic scene back in the 70s was a wild time and it led to some crazy, trippy music. People used the drugs as a way to get their creativity flowing, and a lot of those songs reflect the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Later metal bands took some of that dark, intense vibe from the Romantic Era and ran with it. You can see it in the lyrics of songs like Helter Skelter, which is actually considered one of the first heavy metal songs ever. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier side, and the Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy and intense. They put it on The White Album, and now it's a classic example of the darker side of music.",
            "I was reading about this dude Henri Rousseau and how he was making his own dreams come true - literally and figuratively - back in the day. His painting, \"The Dream\" from 1910, isn't just about some chick in awe of this fantastical land she's visiting in her dreams, it's also about Rousseau's own hopes and aspirations as an artist. He started off wanting people to recognize him, accept him, and give him props as a painter, but he was stuck in a weird internal struggle. See, he wanted to either play by the rules and do what other artists were doing so he'd get noticed by the art world crowd, or just be himself and forge his own path. \"The Dream\" is like the ultimate representation of this internal conflict that Rousseau faced his whole career.\n\nTo really get what's going on with this painting, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life. He was born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, and his dad was this tinsmith who had a pretty good life. Rousseau didn't get any formal art training; instead, he worked for the town as a toll service guy until he was 40. He got called a \"customs inspector,\" but that's not exactly what he did. After losing his wife and eight kids, he turned to painting to escape his pain and start fresh. Unlike other artists of his time who painted all sappy and romantic about peasants, Rousseau was a true folk painter who just wanted to live the average guy's life.\n\nIt's not surprising that Rousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world, given that he was basically a self-taught painter who started late in life, and there were all these other talented artists around at the same time. He didn't get any real recognition until around the same time that Matisse was building his rep as an artist. Jan Gordon, the author of Modern French Painters, said that while Matisse was trying to avoid painting something boring, Rousseau was all about painting something so normal that people would think he was a \"real\" artist. It's pretty deep, man.",
            "A lot of deep thinkers have said that ethics and aesthetics are super connected, like two peas in a pod. I think there's a reason for this. John Keats said it best in that one poem, \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we know comes from learning or experiencing stuff, but it seems like we actually get ethics and aesthetics without needing a teacher to tell us about it. Both ethics and aesthetics are about describing, not dictating - like trying to figure out why a work of art is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than making up a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. \n\nTo get to the point, you can't fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful just by talking about it. Trying to analyze the Mona Lisa might be all about stuff like the foreground and background, but those things don't really tell you why it's so amazing. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say something like, \"There's just something about it,\" and then give a more complicated explanation. I think that's because art and morals can't be reduced to just describing their qualities. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" and I think that's true for ethics too. No matter how much you describe the properties of a work of literature, there's still something left that's hard to put into words. I think that's the same with ethics - it's like this mysterious, otherworldly thing that we can experience but can't fully explain. \n\nI think that's why ethics and art are so closely connected - we experience them both at this deep, unexplainable level. This is especially true for literature, as McKean said, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. It's like it's a part of life itself.\" We all experience life with values, and that's why literature is important to us because of the values we find there.",
            "Germany's strong presence in the world today is really something to be reckoned with. It's a country with its own unique culture that stretches from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from Köln on the Rhine River through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It shouldn't be a surprise that Germany's culture has roots from all over since it's made up of different tribes and sources. \n\nThe land where the Germans originated is called Germania, but its name's meaning is a total mystery. Some experts think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. However, others believe it might have come from the Gauls themselves, who used the word 'Germanus' to describe their neighbors. Julius Caesar first used this word to distinguish between the Gauls he conquered and the Germanic tribes he fought against. In his book about the Gallic Wars, he wrote that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly battling the Gauls in almost daily fights. But where exactly the name 'German' came from is still a debate - some say it's from the spear they used in battle, the 'ger', while others think it might be from the Old Irish word 'garim', which means 'to shout', implying the Germans were pretty loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' back in AD 98. He described the Germans as being aboriginal, not mixed with other races, and living on ships when they wanted to leave their homeland. He wondered why anyone would leave a place like Rome for a wild and harsh land like Germania, unless it was their home. So, the Romans didn't exactly conquer Germania, but they did send out their soldiers to trade and fight there. The Germanic tribes started appearing in the early first century and lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I was just staring blankly at something in front of me, my mind not really paying attention. I was in a pretty robotic state, just taking it all in without thinking about it too much. My thoughts were zipping in and out so fast I couldn't really catch any of them - it was like my brain was just going through the motions. It was actually kind of weird, like I didn't really have any real thoughts of my own, just a bunch of stuff happening in my head.\n\nRecently I picked up this art book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain after some advice from an artist I was working with. I've wanted to draw since I was like six and this book teaches you all the basics, from what a pencil even is to how the brain works when you're looking at lines. One trick it shows you is to draw a square around whatever you're looking at to make it simpler. It's like turning a super complicated picture into something you can actually handle.\n\nAt the time, I was staring at this bowl of fruit and just couldn't get my brain to think about it in a more simple way. I was so overwhelmed that I just stood there staring in awe. I guess you could say the great artists like Picasso went through different phases - blue, green, all that stuff. If I wanted to be a \"real\" artist, I guess this was the start of my picture, my story, my thing - which I thought of as Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up my pencil and started to draw, my hand moving over the paper, but then I kind of snapped out of it and smacked my hand on the toilet handle. I was trying to, uh, take care of some business, but this brown package was stuck and not going anywhere. I had to use some pretty creative language to describe it. Finally, after a few more attempts, I managed to get it to move. I was still in a pretty calm state, so I just stood there for a second, then I started wrapping the toilet paper around my hand like a mummy. I know it sounds weird, but I was just in this really peaceful, introspective place. I stood up, bent down, and then my hand went into the toilet like I was putting a big turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving...",
            "I went to the dentist and got five teeth pulled so I can get braces by Thursday, but it turns out I don't have any teeth left for them to glue on! The laughing gas really got to me, and I started seeing double everywhere. It was just like that episode of The Simpsons where Lisa gets braces and laughing gas – I kept feeling like I was in the scene where she dreams about The Beatles. The whole time I was numb, I kept hearing my inner voice singing 'I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons!' over and over again. I don't really remember much from the procedure except for the weird needle dream and the last two teeth getting pulled. When I got home, I felt like a chipmunk – I hate being numb, especially when I lost feeling in most of my face, including my ear. Now that's all over, and I'm looking forward to some Tofutti ice cream and sweet potato mush – AlexD suggested I try liquid prime ribs, but I'm not so sure. I have to go through the pain again for braces on Thursday, and I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nI tried to dye my hair blue today in art class, but it didn't work on my dark hair, so I have to highlight it first. I'm hoping to get it done before the Styx concert tomorrow. I used a Sharpie to dye a strand of my hair blue, and surprisingly, it turned out really well, but it dried out my hair a bit. I'm not sure if it'll wash out, so I might have to dye it a lighter blue color. My advisor, Brian, is a Gunker almost, just like Sporko, and he's really knowledgeable about hair dye. I drew him as a rock star on Wednesday, and he's going to help me with my hair tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow is the last day of portrait camp, but I'll be back for the landscape class soon – maybe the 14th or 17th. I'll need all the luck I can get for my hair and the concert.\n\nNow, let's talk about something serious – teenagers are dying behind the wheel. It's a deadly trend that's hard to ignore. Several factors contribute to this problem, including the fact that the teen brain isn't ready for the hazards of driving. Inexperience is another major factor – it not only causes fatal accidents but also increases the risk of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road. And if teens are driving with their peers, which they often do, the risks are even higher. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nStates like California have tried to increase safety by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers. But these measures are just stopgap solutions – the real issue is that young drivers are, by all statistical markers, not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, and his research suggests that people under 19 or 20 tend to take risks for the thrill of it. It makes sense to delay driving until this tendency has leveled out. If we keep issuing licenses to young teens, we'll keep seeing deadly accidents and the death toll will rise to staggering proportions. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's kids will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation to address this issue would be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes, but no one under 18 could get a driver's license. A provisional permit could still be issued before the full license, and a certain number of practical training hours would be required. The number of hours could be based on what most states currently require – like California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country. It's not a new idea, but it's one that's long overdue.",
            "So, I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films and decided to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. These movies are pretty cool because they use some seriously creative editing to create illusions. I mainly focused on studying the poetry behind most of these trick films and figuring out how some of the later ones evolved from the early ones. Generally, trick films from around that time stick to a pretty basic structure – they're set-bound, stuck within a frontal proscenium, don't feature any camera movement, and use long and medium shots. However, some films from the early 1900s started experimenting and breaking these rules by introducing new elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that all these trick films have in common is that they're filmed within a set on a frontal proscenium stage. The camera never moves from its spot, which is pretty common for early films and was actually inspired by theatre and vaudeville/magic acts. But one of the downsides of using a stage is that actors in trick films can only move left or right, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Take the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), for example, where the actors come in from the right side and just walk back and forth along the horizontal axis, even when they're out of frame, the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nThe way these films are composed also means that shots are mostly long shots and occasionally medium shots, but never close-ups. This is similar to how theatre and vaudeville work, where you see the whole performance at once. Since actors never move towards the camera, you never get close-ups. Most early trick films also follow a pretty simple rule: one conceptual shot is equal to one film, which is why most of them are pretty short – around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It's not exactly a compelling narrative either, mostly just short tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single shot might actually be several physical shots joined together to create an illusion, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a close look reveals where the physical shot with Mary's fake severed head starts, even though the whole film is one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "So, I'm telling you about John Taylor of Caroline, this guy who was a total die-hard Republican. He was all about his farm work, but that and his short stint in politics made him a legend for speaking his mind on personal freedoms and government stuff. His big thing was preserving and promoting agriculture, and that influenced how he thought about pretty much everything, including the government and the law. He was all about keeping it real and not letting the government get too big or powerful.\n\nTaylor thought the US had a chance to create the ultimate system since we didn't have any old traditions holding us back. He was all about the natural rights of people and how they're all connected - if one gets taken away, they all do, and it makes the rest less valuable. He said that in a normal state of nature, the strong and mean guys are the ones who get ahead, but that's not how it should be in a civilized society.\n\nTo make a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should be made up of good and bad stuff, like how people are. He was super strict about his idea of good and evil and said that as long as the government is run by humans, it'll have its own set of good and bad qualities. He thought good principles were about protecting private property, helping out farmers, and keeping capitalism in check. He believed a government with good principles would work fairly no matter who's in charge, even if they're just trying to do what's good for themselves. But he also thought that self-interest is just a normal part of being human, and it's only bad when it hurts others. He said a good government needs to keep an eye on people's natural bad tendencies and make sure they don't get out of control.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of other Republicans back then, wanted the government to interpret the Constitution really strictly. He wanted a super small government with only the powers that the Constitution says it has. He knew that a big government is expensive and might turn into a dictatorship, but he also thought that just following the letter of the law without thinking about the people who wrote it could be bad too. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was like a blueprint for the US, because it says we're a bunch of independent states, not just one country.",
            "Going back to the graph, it's pretty clear that the number of commuter log submissions dropped dramatically in the third month of the project. It was pretty discouraging, and I'm still trying to figure out why that happened. Winter had just hit the New England campus, which probably explains some of the decline in people biking or walking to school. At the same time, it was the end of the fall semester, and people were super busy finishing up their schoolwork and dealing with grades. Filling out the commuter log just slipped their minds, I guess. Plus, December is the start of the holiday season, and everyone was either busy or on winter break, so it's no wonder that the log submissions were way down. Classes didn't resume until late January, which maybe explains the low numbers for that month too. But the low numbers in February still don't make sense. We were worried that people's initial enthusiasm for the project would wear off over time, and that's exactly what happened. We tried to combat this with Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did end up boosting log submissions for that month. So, we faced a couple of major challenges: keeping people engaged when they naturally lose interest, and dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that come with higher ed. \n\nAnother big problem is that people love driving their cars because it's so convenient and independent, which is just part of our culture. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we need to offer some serious incentives. We gave out gift cards to local places, but it would have been cool to see how bigger prizes, like a free bike or hybrid car, would have affected participation. That might have helped us avoid that dip in engagement. The prizes we offered didn't change over time, and while the gift cards were nice at first, announcing bigger prizes in December and January might have made a huge difference. We might have seen way higher participation rates instead of declining ones.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a super flexible security that's like a stock, but tracks an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets like an index fund.  You get the benefits of owning a single stock, like selling short and buying on margin, and the diversification of an index fund, but with lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund.  The downside is that you'll have to pay a commission on trades, just like with stocks.  On the plus side, there are tons of ETFs to choose from.  But, it's always smart to double-check the benefits, like diversification, to make sure they're really there and how much they're worth.  For this project, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is as good as owning a diversified portfolio of those 10 stocks.  We also want to know if there's a better way to mix and match those stocks for a better return and lower risk.\n\nTo make things simpler, we're only looking at the top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  These are the stocks that are included below.  To figure out how well these 10 stocks represent the entire ETF, we're calculating their Beta and Return as if they were the only stocks in the portfolio.  We're using the current percentages of the holdings to do this.  The chart below shows the results.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a return that's 6.11% higher than the ETF, which is a 16% increase.  It also shows that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is .12 lower than the ETF's Beta.  So far, it looks like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could be a better bet, but we need to make sure the difference is real and not just a fluke.  To do this, we're looking at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and comparing it to the ETF's standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's favorite poems is Dream-Land. In Dream-Land, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\", which he likely got from Virgil. But there's a catch - Virgil might not have been the first person to use this term. It's also possible that Poe borrowed it from another source, especially since he was super into German authors. \n\nThis is significant because it shows just how familiar Poe was with Goethe's writing. Some people, like Karl J. Arndt, think that Poe was even copying Goethe's style. Arndt wrote about this in his book Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. \n\nYou can find a whole poem called \"The King of Thulé\" in the second part of Goethe's famous poetic drama Faust. It's about a king who's really upset after his wife dies and gives him a special goblet. He starts drinking a lot and crying, and eventually decides it's time to die. He gives away all his stuff except the goblet and then jumps off a cliff. Sounds pretty similar to the King of Thule in Dream-Land, right? Maybe it's like a darker version of Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nFaust was also made into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thulé in The Pit and the Pendulum. Poe actually mentions Thulé twice in his writing - once in The Pit and the Pendulum and twice in Dream-Land. You could say that \"The King of Thule\" and Dream-Land are like two poems that go together. In Dream-Land, the speaker talks about how dark and lonely Thulé is, and how he's haunted by dead friends. It's like he's stepping into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a huge deal, and Poe must have known about him because of his respect for Tennyson. Poe said that he admired Tennyson, and Tennyson was really into Goethe. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in all the reproductions that were happening after the original publication. So, it's no surprise that Poe was influenced by Goethe's style.",
            "I've been wondering if a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could get punitive damages under California law if the store manager was really careless. He was told about the spill twice, but he didn't clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. A judge might not dismiss the customer's claim right away. To get punitive damages, the customer will have to show that the manager was super reckless and knew how bad his actions would be. The customer can argue that the manager should have known this because a bunch of other customers had slipped and fallen at the store before, and he still didn't do anything about it. Even though this isn't the strongest reason, it's a pretty good one, considering that six people had slipped and fallen in the store that year, and the manager still didn't take care of the problem.\n\nIt turns out that the manager, Paul Martin, was really relaxed about cleaning up the spill. On October 13th, one of his employees, Rich Wayne, told him about it, but Martin said he was on a break and didn't have time for customer complaints. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reminded him an hour later, and he gave the same response. An hour after that, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got really hurt. Before that, five other people had slipped and fallen in the store that year. Now Palmer is suing the store for money to cover her medical bills and some extra money to teach the store a lesson. We're thinking about whether to ask the judge to throw out that part of the lawsuit.\n\nIn California, a customer can get punitive damages if the store did something really bad on purpose or was super reckless and didn't care about the consequences. The law says that if the store didn't mean to hurt the customer, but still did something really bad, it's like they did it on purpose. This can happen if the store knew what they were doing would hurt someone, but they went ahead and did it anyway. A court said that's what happened in a case called Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the store was aware of the risks and still didn't do anything to prevent them.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, which got me thinking about how people view the religion.  One thing that really stuck out was the debate over whether Islam is actually a hostile faith - a question that's even more relevant now than back then.  Looking back on what's happened since 9/11, I've seen the media's attitude swing from being super negative to being super tolerant of Islam in the US.  I mean, can you imagine a presidential candidate with a Muslim background like Barack Obama in 2001?  It's crazy.\n\nWhat really got me was reading the Prophet's biography.  From what I knew, I thought Muhammad was all about forcing people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a totally different picture - he's more like a martyr who's humble and misunderstood.  People come to him because they're convinced by his teachings, not because he's forcing them to join.  It's weird, because there are some pretty cool similarities between Jesus and Muhammad's alleged miracles, like the time Muhammad fed a group of people with some mutton and milk.  But it's always bugging me that the writers of the biography seem to be trying to make Muhammad out to be this humble guy who doesn't need to prove anything.  It's like they're trying to take credit for Jesus' life and message by linking it to Muhammad.  \n \nI also have some issues with the way the stories in the biography are presented.  A lot of them are second-hand or third-hand accounts, which just makes me think they're not entirely trustworthy.  It's like they're trying to prove that people converted to Islam of their own free will, but it comes across as kinda suspicious.  What really gets my goat is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, godly guy who's humble and wise.  But the historical record says otherwise - and I wonder if Muslims today know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It appears that Jesus' teachings and the beliefs he held during his lifetime got lost in the shuffle as Christianity continued to evolve after he was gone.  If you look at the history of Christianity in general terms, you can see a pattern where the original teachings have gradually drifted away.  Nowadays, it's more and more clear that people are becoming more open-minded and there's a growing trend of progress.  While traditionalists will resist any change from what they were taught, their numbers might not be enough to sway the masses.  Within Christianity, a deeper understanding of history will grow over the coming years, and people will start to differentiate between the ideas that were added to the religion over time and what Jesus originally intended.  It might take a long time, decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  There will be a major shift in the way Christianity has been progressing.  The trend will reverse itself, moving backward until all that's left is the original stuff that Jesus brought to the world on behalf of God, before other thinkers started making their own claims.  When this shift starts spreading through the US and Europe, a lot of people will begin to worship in the same way they did back in Jesus' time, following his ideas alone.  The church as an institution will still be a major force, but because the theological clock will be turned back, the huge variety in Christianity will start to shrink into more and more uniformity of beliefs and practices.  Instead of seeing lots of differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, people will start to notice more and more similarities.  History is full of great reversals like this - think about how Christians used to be persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but then the empire became a Christian institution, or how our country went from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  A similar big reversal is coming in the Christian world, undoing history to get back to the source, and in the process, undoing the diversity that's developed over time.  A crucial part of this process will be understanding Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than taking them as literal statements.  So, what happened since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking way back into history, we can see that the only thing that existed was Judaism, which is the foundation for the Christian religion.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already at the core of Judaism.  But even back then, the Jewish population wasn't a single, unified group - they split into different factions, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of regular people.",
            "I think that The Jungle really brings out how selfish and self-centered people are deep down. They only care about themselves and making their own lives awesome, but they never think about anyone below them. This is shown in many ways in The Jungle. The owners and managers of the big factories are a total example of this. All they care about is making their companies huge and powerful. They don't even think about anyone or anything that gets in their way or gets harmed because of their stuff. Upton Sinclair is really good at painting a picture of just how bad the pollution from these factories is in his book. He says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's trying to show just how much damage all this pollution is causing. The owners don't care if anyone gets hurt. They don't care about all the smoke coming out of the factories or the gross stuff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also didn't care about their employees at all. They would do anything to make or save a little more money. \"So from the top to bottom the place is just a huge mix of jealousies and hatreds; there's no loyalty or decency anywhere, there's no place where a person counts for anything against a dollar\". They made their employees work super long hours and then would just get rid of loads of people without any notice or help finding a new job. During the time The Jungle is set in, there were hardly any laws to protect workers' safety or well-being. This let the managers and owners do whatever they wanted, making their employees speed up and work in terrible conditions. The people who lived and worked in Packingtown were basically expected to deal with the awful conditions, both on the job and at home. There were no organizations or agencies to help the workers. There were unions, but they often made more money off the poor workers than they helped them. The workers were treated so badly and had no way to escape the system of Packingtown that they were basically treated like slaves. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "A lot of authors use different techniques in their writing to get a specific emotion or attitude across to their readers. Some of these techniques work way better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of The Great Gatsby, uses a lot of these techniques in his novel. Sometimes, he pairs words together in a way that doesn't usually go together to create a certain vibe about a subject. Other times, he gives a certain meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. \n\nOne technique Fitzgerald uses often is building up a meaning for colors and then later using that meaning to remind readers of a particular feeling around an important thing. He does this with colors like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald starts giving meaning to white and gray and then later uses that meaning to create a certain feeling about something.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white and gray is all about uniformity and sameness. He shows this by using these colors a lot at the beginning of the novel. For example, everyone is always wearing white. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\", and even the settings are described with white and gray: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\". The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick gives his impression of Gatsby's party. Fitzgerald even defines these colors by using them to describe everyday, unimportant things like buildings, people, and names. \n\nAfter Fitzgerald has built up the meaning of white and gray, he starts using them to show how unimportant or boring something is. He does this by using these colors to describe Daisy, who used to be a bigger character, but now feels more like just a boring addition to the story. Fitzgerald does this by describing Daisy wearing white or gray, like when she's dressed in white in a little white roadster. The readers start to see her as just a part of the uniform, something that Gatsby wants and longs for. He does this again and again to make this point about Daisy being a boring addition. For example, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and she's wearing white again before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is super fertile due to its pleasant, sunny climate. They grow all sorts of yummy stuff like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a huge demand for organic food in the area, with lots of people waiting months to get their hands on it. People also love buying organic eggs and milk. Many of these farms even let you come and explore their operations, hike, or go birdwatching - it's like getting a free mini-vacation. This type of farm can help the landowner get government cash while keeping the land nice and healthy, which is awesome because it lets people visit and learn stuff.\n\nNot only does this type of farming make a bunch of money, but it also brings in all sorts of cool wildlife because they don't use yucky chemicals. However, it's way more work and can be more expensive than regular farming because you have to get rid of pests and weeds the hard way and manually fertilize the soil. You also might lose more crops, and a small farm can't compete with those giant, industrial farms when it comes to efficiency. They also have to do extra stuff like planting special crops to keep the soil healthy and removing invasive species, which costs more time and money.\n\nThis land I chose for this example is in an awesome spot near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan is all over the area, and they're still reviewing it. It's home to over a hundred species of plants and animals, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, which are all in danger of disappearing. This land has been home to Native Americans for a super long time and was later used for cattle ranching and selling cordwood in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it probably used to be used for grazing and wood production for a while.\n\nI picked a piece of land from a real estate site and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might be able to do to make farming more affordable and still save the wildlife. I chose an organic farm in the same area as a model of what someone might try to do with this land.",
            "Culture's impact on a negotiation is significant. Culture isn't just what it is, but also what it isn't and what it signifies. It's not a single, unified thing, nor is it the same across the board. General statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are way too broad and pretty simplistic. It's more productive for a negotiator to understand the importance of a culture to the specific negotiation at hand and how that culture's attitude will affect the discussion. When you encounter a foreign culture, you experience it in a way that relates to your own, which leads to comparisons.\n\nGetting to know a foreign culture or mindset can involve studying its history, understanding its biases, or learning about its traditions. Rather than judging or trying to change it, you need to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when negotiating. If you're in a weaker position, showing respect for the other culture and its traditions can really help you break down any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture isn't just about national or international differences. Companies often have their own unique corporate culture, which can vary greatly from one company to another. For instance, some companies might expect employees to work long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. Look at how different companies in the same country can have distinct corporate cultures, from dress codes to communication styles to hiring practices. Some companies might even have different corporate cultures within the same company, depending on the region or location.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is also key, because it helps you understand the \"why\" behind it. If saving face or maintaining harmony are important in a culture, you can bet that a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company or superior to get ahead in a negotiation. On the other hand, a negotiator from a culture that values a tough bargain won't necessarily settle for a quick agreement. Knowing these generalities beforehand is crucial before sitting down at the negotiating table. However, it's also really helpful to learn something about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation go smoothly.",
            "There's this famous phrase from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" It's actually the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. We're also gonna look at Thomas Aquinas, and since their ideas pretty much support the same concept, we'll assume they're both right about God being the one from the Bible. If their God wasn't from the Bible, it'd be hard to compare their arguments since they're really trying to prove one specific version of God exists. So, we're gonna start by thinking they both believe in the same God.\n\nTo get a feel for their ideas, let's look at St. Anselm's first. Anselm says that we can figure out God by looking inside ourselves. He thinks that since we can't really imagine a world without God, it's proof that God exists in our minds. This idea can get a bit confusing, but basically, Anselm's saying that we can know God just by thinking about what we already know to be true. That's kinda like having faith – it's not about needing proof, it's about trusting what's inside your head. This is a big deal in Christianity because it's about trusting in something that might not be proven.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas took a different approach. He thinks we can prove God exists using logic and facts, no faith needed. This would actually be pretty cool for spreading the word of Christianity because people wouldn't need to believe something just because they're told to – they could believe it because it makes sense. Aquinas came up with five separate arguments to show that God must exist because of the way the world works: change, cause and effect, things that are temporary, levels of perfection, and things working together in harmony. Each one basically says that since we can see how all these things need a creator, we can know God must be that creator without even seeing God.",
            "Sometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would eventually be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, this prince made the choice to leave behind worldly life and achieve enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism. Over time, the teachings have led to the formation of the most traditional form of Buddhism, which is often referred to as Theravada. As the religion has aged – it's now around 2500 years old – it's undergone a lot of changes. This is clear when looking at countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada community has developed unique traditions and celebrations, like the water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is observed by both monks and lay followers, but interestingly, it wasn't something that Buddha himself ever taught about. The differences between past and present can be seen in both the surface-level customs and the core teachings of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its guiding principles over the years, both when influenced by external forces, like those from outside the Buddhist community, and internal ones, like changes within the community itself.\n\nTo make sense of this discussion, it's essential to understand some key concepts that will be used throughout. 'Internal' refers to forces generated by members of the Buddhist community, regardless of whether they're monks or lay followers. 'External' forces come from outside the Buddhist community. A 'hostile' force is one that aims to harm or damage the community, often due to a negative perception of Buddhism. A 'benign' force, on the other hand, doesn't intend to harm or help the community, but may end up doing so as a byproduct.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to explore the fundamentals of Theravada Buddhism – the core teachings that it's built upon. Buddhists find refuge in the 'triple gem': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the three baskets (Tripitaka) of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas (Buddhist teachings), the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the more abstract, metaphysical concepts of Buddhism, such as the idea that there is no permanent soul (Anatta), that life is marked by inherent suffering (Dukkha), and that everything is impermanent (Anicca). Recognizing these concepts is crucial in breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), will cease when one achieves enlightenment. In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for living are outlined. For lay followers, there are five basic principles to follow (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral behavior, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, must adhere to many more rules. The core of Buddhism, however, is the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico were at odds for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, due to a longstanding rivalry. This tension was at its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the US defeated Mexico and took control of Texas and the American Southwest (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). Many other conflicts occurred between the two nations, but they eventually cooled off just before World War I. The initial conflict started with disagreements over issues like religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThis situation isn't unique - many neighboring nations have similar rivalries. When countries share a border, their conflicting interests can lead to the formation of opposing stances between them. The US and Mexico aren't the only example of this; other nations with a history of border disputes often have similar issues. David M. Pletcher notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only Latin American nations that have had long-standing diplomatic troubles with the US (1977, p. 41).\n\nOne major point of contention between the US and Mexico was their religious differences, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm points out that Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries, just as they were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century (2001, p. 86). Like the ideological struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, this rivalry was based on differing values and interests, but in this case, they stemmed from the US and Mexico's contrasting religious preferences. This distrust was inherited from their colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, making it difficult for the two nations to establish friendly relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during this 57-year period, mostly related to territorial issues, such as border raids and frontier problems. Border bandits and outlaws from American towns were a significant problem until the US and Mexico took military action to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). Schmitt notes that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and eventually ended as the US shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (1974, p. 109-110).",
            "It's been 15 years since I was taken down by a sickness that caught me completely off guard. Back then I was working as a nurse because, as a kid, I didn't have the stability and security I craved. People kept saying things like 'You'll always find work - people will always get sick' so I picked nursing over my true passions, which were science and journalism. Even though I had dreams of being both, it was easier to rely on a steady income. \n\nI'm now 46 and single, broke, and unable to work because of this illness. I've been living off Social Security Disability for 15 years, and to this day, I have nothing that's truly mine. Each day feels like a struggle, an assault on my sense of security, safety, and confidence. Nothing feels secure anymore, but one thing I know for sure - if it weren't for my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. Even when disaster strikes, you don't feel as strong as you thought you'd be.\n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected emergencies, big and small. No matter how prepared you are, some things are just too overwhelming to handle on your own. The U.S. needs to stop putting all its eggs in the government basket, which is crumbling anyway. Instead, I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, to ask for help without hesitation.\n\nThe U.S. Conservatives keep talking about rugged individualism, but the truth is, our ancestors' success in tough times wasn't about going it alone - it was about compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources. The pioneers who trekked across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by themselves.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have a disaster kit stocked with first aid supplies, water purifiers, and emergency essentials. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, and canned goods. If you have the means and resources for a small farm, that's a great idea too. But while you're at it, take the time to know your neighbors - it might just save you in a pinch.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there any rules or limitations that affect the direction of evolutionary change? Even back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that zoologists had barely started to think about describing simple organic shapes using math. Nowadays, it's still pretty much the same. Lately, scientists have tried using math to figure out how mollusks' skeletons grow and change over time. Our research is focused on using math to understand how animals like Prunum change and grow. We're combining math with experiments to learn more about how evolution works.\n\nWe looked at X-ray pictures of Prunum shells to find patterns that we could use to create models of how shells might change over time. We fed this data into a computer program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995) and used it to imagine how shells could be different. These ideas are being combined with other studies to help us understand how big changes happened in this group of animals.\n\nIf you think about a shell as a tube that moves through space over time, it's kind of like a big spiral staircase. The different turns of the shell are called whorls, and they're connected by a line called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, and the other whorls are called the spire. The pointy top of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles - apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. A way to count the whorls is to look at the shell from the top and draw a line where the first suture starts. Then, we count the whorls from that line, estimating a quarter of a whorl if it's not a whole number.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through space and time as the animal builds its shell. We can track the path of these holes by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. This path can be represented mathematically and graphically. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how it affects the way the shell grows.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant deaths in Indonesia hasn't really changed over the past ten years.  It's weird, because the country is doing pretty well in other areas like water and sanitation, but when it comes to keeping babies and moms safe, they're way behind where they need to be by 2015. I'm gonna get into the reasons later, but basically, it's time to make the whole health system stronger instead of just focusing on individual programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress with getting medical workers at births, with 72% of births meeting this target now. But it's a little misleading because they include midwives who can't do much if something goes wrong, so a lot of moms still die from things like bleeding after delivery. Plus, it's not like they're getting better care for the little kids either - in fact, they're getting worse. We don't have all the info on post-birth care, but it's pretty clear that's another problem area.\n\nC-sections are still way too low, only 4%, and it's even worse in rural areas where it's only 2%. That shows how uneven healthcare is around the country, with mostly rich people getting the good stuff. And to make things worse, there's a huge gap in healthcare access between the poor and the rich - it's like a 27% difference. So, the poor people are basically stuck without access to healthcare because they can't afford it.\n\nNow we have to figure out how to fix this, and the main question is whether to focus on improving specific programs or strengthening the whole health system. It's tempting to do the specific programs because they're more focused, but they also have some major drawbacks. For one thing, it's hard to get funding for other areas when someone's getting a lot of attention for one thing. And with too many programs going on at once, you end up with a bunch of duplicate services and a huge mess of paperwork and supplies.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the high society of the time.  However, two novels that stray from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels feature an element of mystery and a penchant for the bizarre, which is unusual for the period, and this adds depth to the characters; giving insight into their motives and emotions.  \n\nAnd then, a jumble of confusing ideas started racing through his mind.  He was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing loudly; the words they said were still echoing in his ears; and when he suddenly snapped back to reality, he realized he was talking to them.  Then, the sound of gunfire startled him, and he was bombarded by a cacophony of screams and shouts.  Everything around him was a blur, and he felt an overwhelming sense of pain that refused to subside.\n\nThese two novels often use mystery through dreamlike states, though the content and purpose varies in each case.  In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal Oliver's innermost thoughts, his fears, and his awareness of the harsh reality around him.  When Oliver is shot in the end, the scene is revisited in chapter 28, and he relives it vividly, as if it were a dream, while desperately trying to find help.  The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as his dire circumstances, which are evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses; he's unaware of the 'unseen force' that's taking him away.  His despair is replayed before him, now constant and linked with fear rather than shock.  With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises as to whose actions led to his misfortune, since it was certainly not his own.  This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, not even his own life, as he fails to even attempt to take control of an event's outcome.  A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin had broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and lose his ability to react.  Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\nThe day passed all too quickly – it was gone before he knew it – and night fell again, long and oppressive in its silence, but brief in its fleeting moments.",
            "I used to work at an after-school program where I helped elementary students with their schoolwork. My specialty was English and reading, but I tried to assist them in whatever subjects they were struggling with. I was asked to work with this kid named Adrian, who was having some serious trouble reading. At first, I thought he was just having a tough time, but it turned out that something weird was going on - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly, but others were way off. I knew he was of Latino descent, but he spoke perfect English, which was really weird. We struggled to figure out what was going on until the day I met his mom. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish, and I was barely learning it at the time. We managed to communicate somehow, but it hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized that Adrian knew how to read just fine - he just didn't know the English alphabet. I don't know if that insight really helped him much, but I hope he's doing okay now.\n\nI share that story to highlight the problem of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think - even if a kid speaks perfect English, reading can still be super tough. Everyone agrees that this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: one-on-one tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no single answer. Some people swear by the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or a combination of all of the above. The key is to try a bit of everything.\n\nThe dual language system is a great idea - not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. It's been shown that kids in these programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of people are scared that it's a waste of resources, but that's not true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from them. So, how do we make it happen? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But we can definitely have special aides, tutors, or whatever, who are bilingual. It's not that hard.",
            "Most of us are led to believe that there's something much bigger than ourselves out there, something we can barely wrap our heads around. We're often sent to places like Sunday school or Temple to learn about it, or we search within for answers on our own. Some people just go along with the religions their parents taught them, while others totally reject the idea that there's anything more to life than what they can see and touch. We might adopt one set of values, only to later switch to another. Wherever we go, we're trying to figure out who we are and what we believe through our own special ways of looking at spirituality. We're on a quest to find the light in the dark and guide ourselves out of the shadows and into the sunlight.\n\nMy dad told me that cardinals are his favorite bird when I asked him, and we sat on our porch listening to the rain pound against the tin roof. The gutters were overflowing, drowning the plants along the porch edge. He stared out at the rain, lost in thought, his eyes half searching, half remembering. He'd lost a lot of weight over the past few months, and his clothes hung loose on his body. His hair was thinning out, too. He didn't want to talk about how sick he was, and I was too scared to bring it up. If we talked about it, it would make it feel more real. So I just hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my birthday. The chemo and radiation had kept him alive for a few more months, but it was just prolonging the suffering. I couldn't help but wonder, what was the point of it all? I stopped going to church, and at night, I just lay awake, wondering if God was even listening. I knew that if God was real, he'd stopped caring about me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to see my dad die, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the man who created me slip away. I wanted to remember him for who he was, not how he died. And I knew my dad would've wanted it that way too. So I curled up in a ball and waited for the news. Nobody even bothered calling me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is actually an oxymoron, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements, as Ian Watt so astutely points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This style has been met with both praise and criticism, with some dismissing it as lacking depth, while others hail its ability to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). At the time of its creation, Horace Walpole's \"A Gothic Story\" (as he called it) blended old theatrical elements with new, modern ideas to give birth to the Gothic genre. The Gothic style borrowed heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already seen as old-fashioned and unsophisticated compared to the more modern societal and literary advancements of the time. It was this unexpected mix of the old and the new that allowed the Gothic genre to endure and remain fresh to readers even centuries later.\n\nOne of the most significant features of Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry, which was a major part of medieval culture. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole took this concept and adapted it to suit his story, creating a knight-like character that embodied the qualities that were seen as lacking in his own time. Walpole was writing in a tumultuous era, and his work reflects his fears about the state of society. He may have believed that the morality and goodness that were once associated with the Gothic era had been lost in the present, leading him to idealize and romanticize the past. This is evident in the character of Frederic, who is described as a prince, a sufferer, and a gallant knight. His portrayal is a classic example of the chivalric ideals that were prominent in medieval culture, and it sets the stage for the excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The process of moving goods from the customer's order to the final product delivery is called supply chain management. This concept was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver back in 1982. He described it as a series of processes that work together to deliver customer needs efficiently. There are six main components to a well-functioning supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these elements to provide top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst up is production, the foundation of the entire supply chain process. It's where you figure out when, why, where, and how products get made. To succeed, managers need to know what customers want, and they can find that out by studying the market. Once they've got a handle on customer demand, they can decide what products to make, how many, and where to produce them. They've got to choose a production location that'll meet customer needs for both volume and quality. Next, they focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment to keep things running smoothly.\n\nGetting production right is huge – every detail matters. If you mess up, it can cost a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, my past experience working at Wal-Mart and Target taught me that having clear processes in place is key. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, every step should be outlined to avoid confusion and miscommunication.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves making strategic decisions about a company's capabilities and partnerships. This might involve deciding which production divisions to use for a single product or outsourcing certain tasks to other companies. The goal is to create velocity – delivering quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "It's this sign I saw that really caught my attention: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". I was walking down the street and Ellen Page from that movie Juno was standing there holding a weird sign with Sharpie writing on it. Burma is this country in Southeast Asia where a super strict government took over in 1962 and hasn't really changed since. There was this huge protest in 2007, it was called the Saffron Revolution, because they wore these bright orange robes, and it was the first time people had protested in like a decade. But things escalated quickly and the government started getting really violent. They rounded up all the journalists and even killed a Japanese photographer just for being there. The government said like 13 people died, but this army colonel said that's way off and that there were actually thousands.\n\nIt's not like this is new or anything. For as long as we've had civilization, governments have been trying to shut down any dissent and keep everyone in line. Even ancient Roman emperors thought they were chosen by the gods and could control everything. Japanese emperors thought they were gods too, and our current president, I'm pretty sure, has weekly meetings with some dude from the Republic Party, Ted Haggard. There have been some really crazy events like that, like the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989 where students and intellectuals were killed by the government, and the Rwandan genocide in the 90s where the government killed tons of people just because of who they were. And then there's the whole Hitler thing, but that's pretty self explanatory.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his long career and incredible musical abilities. His piano playing might not be super obvious in many of the songs we're looking at, but as a composer, Ellington was amazing at writing complex pieces that let individual band members shine. He'd create the foundation for a soloist to improvise freely, and also write tightly orchestrated parts that made the most of each band member's style. By doing this, Ellington helped bring out the unique tone of the entire orchestra, making each piece its own. He was a master at understanding how the different band members sounded individually and how they worked together, which is why he wrote some of the most groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's innovative sound and techniques, using Creole Love Call as an example of how he used voice like a jazz instrument throughout his career. This was basically an early experiment with using vocal textures and colors without worrying about lyrics. It also shows Ellington's skill at complementing the style of his soloists, which is something he did really well his whole career. This slow, bluesy twelve-bar piece is a great example - it's got six different sections, each one showcasing the band's different sounds:\n\nThe first chorus is a call-and-response thing with voice and reeds, where the voice starts off smooth and gets rougher towards the end. The second chorus has a muted trumpet solo that adds some extra flavor to the basic melody. The third chorus is a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a simple piano phrase. The fourth chorus is like a big echo of the first one, with the brass and reed sections trading calls and responses. The fifth chorus is the climax, with the reeds taking over the call-and-response and the brass and rhythm sections adding some syncopated rhythms. And the sixth chorus is like the first one, but this time the voice gets all growly and does some instrumental-style soloing.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color to his music is just one example of the cool stuff he did. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his tight orchestration skills with his ear for tone, using a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich sound. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), he made great use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "There was this huge emptiness inside her that she just couldn't shake off. It was a feeling she's had ever since she was 14 and still lingered on at 17. It started as a craving for something, but she had no idea what. She figured out that it wasn't just about things, but about people, specifically - but no one had ever caught her eye. Some guys had tried to get her attention, but every attempt just felt forced. She often found herself wondering what could be the reason behind this crazy desire. Over the years, she'd come up with some theories, but none of them really made sense to her. So, she just kept on living, always questioning her feelings.\n\nAt home, everything was usually chill. She had pretty cool parents who hardly ever argued. When they did, it was usually about her wanting to be her own person. That's because she was super outgoing and fun, like the complete opposite of her calm parents. Today, though, was a different story. As she was looking for some inspiration, she heard a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen and her mom's voice. She rushed in to find her mom on the ground, looking like she was in a lot of pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she frantically asked as she ran to her side and put a hand on her to help. Her mom said \"Ow... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital\" in a really short breath. She could tell her mom was in a lot of pain, so she helped her get off the ground and into the car.\n\nThe hospital had that weird smell of disinfectant and illness, but she was too worried about her mom to feel scared. She quickly grabbed a wheelchair and rushed in to get help. A bunch of worried faces showed up, but her mind was just on her mom. They got her mom onto a bed and took her to see a doctor. Her daughter was left to sit and stress.\n\nApparently, her mom fell off a step stool while trying to get a vase from a super high cabinet. That's how she ended up in the hospital.",
            "This study aimed to figure out if sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), which can be measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", would help lower the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is an adjusted version of the Med diet that's loaded with more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less saturated fat and animal products. It also allows for some booze.\n\nWe already knew from prior studies that eating the Med diet was linked to lower heart disease risk and death, but those studies didn't focus on stroke alone. This study looked at 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who were part of a huge study of female nurses in the US. The researchers tracked their eating habits over 20 years using special questionnaires. About 95% of the women stuck with the study the whole time, and the questionnaires were double-checked to make sure they were accurate.\n\nThe researchers found out what happened to the women over the years by looking at their medical records, death certificates, and hospital info. They even made some educated guesses when they couldn't find the records. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like weight, smoking, exercise, and whether the women took aspirin or vitamins.\n\nTo get a better idea of the women's eating habits over time, the researchers added up their aMed scores from six different questionnaires. Then they adjusted for things that could mess up the results, like age, smoking, and weight. They used a special method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how the aMed diet score affected the women's risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study showed that women who ate the Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Over 20 years, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 heart disease deaths. Women with the highest aMed scores were 29% less likely to get heart disease or stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "It's been over a decade since the US hit rock bottom in 2007, and the aftermath of the financial crisis is still causing waves. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market tanked, and some of America's biggest corporations were left to pick up the pieces. So the question on everyone's mind is: how did this mess happen in the first place? In a nutshell, it all came down to some pretty shady and clueless decision-making by politicians who basically strong-armed banks into giving out sub-prime loans to people who couldn't afford them. At the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being pushed to buy up these dodgy mortgages and package them into some crazy financial instruments that nobody really understood. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were left high and dry and had no choice but to pass the buck to all the other financial institutions they'd sold these toxic assets to.\n\nIt all started brewing back in the Clinton era, when the President was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to boost his popularity, so he relaxed some of the lending rules, which ended up setting the stage for the sub-prime disaster to come. Steve Holmes from the New York Times was onto it back in 1999, warning that Fannie Mae was taking on too much risk by pushing mortgage loans to low-income folks and that it might all come crashing down in an economic downturn. And boy, was he right.\n\nThe economy was like a house of cards, with all these fancy new mortgage types - adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations - that just made things worse. It was like a game of financial Jenga, where everyone was over-leveraging themselves in the housing market, and when the bubble burst, it was game over. The top five investment banks were stuck with a whopping $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which was basically a third of the US GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers went under, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to sell out to become commercial banks with tighter regulations. Fannie and Freddie were in even worse shape, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and the government had to step in to take control in 2008.",
            "But then there's that infamous part of your story, the expositional stretch where you're supposed to flex your writing muscles, but end up putting everyone to sleep instead.  You know, the spot where your readers are either nodding off or frantically hitting the \"Back\" button, cursing your name in the process.  Dr. Merlin sometimes finds herself yelling at her monitor when she gets stuck in this rut, and it's not even the good kind of yelling.\n\nExposition isn't exactly your BFF.\n\nOf course, you probably already know the \"Show, don't tell\" mantra, but Dr. Merlin still manages to get herself stuck in long, meandering passages where nothing much happens – or worse, too much happens.  It's like that pesky devil on your shoulder, urging you to get all the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the other devil telling you to spill every single juicy detail about each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially just telling the audience what's going on in simple, straightforward language.  It's like the movie version, where one character lays it all out for another in a long, rambling monologue (think \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\").  In fiction, you're the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example.  You're reading a story and you're hit with a barrage of info about the heroine: she met her beloved at such-and-such a place, they got hitched in a fancy wedding, and her hubby got whacked right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect that whole sequence to take up two whole pages, with the couple only getting a couple of lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing how much he loved the heroine through his words and actions.  You'd also want to see how much her life changed and improved with him around – especially if the story later reveals that's exactly what happened.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and understand the heroine's feelings, making you more invested in her story as a whole.\n\nIn short, you'd want some substance to go along with the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that extra oomph.  It can be tempting to rush through certain parts, but resist the urge.  Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, works the graveyard shift at a gas station, has been married twice, doesn't have kids, and dreams of owning the gas station one day – all while secretly craving Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched the news from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first thing that caught my attention was a live report from NBC 4 in the morning. They had a story about a guy in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife (they didn't mention her name, but that's not the point). The dude looked pretty sinister in his mug shot - I could tell it was evil written all over his face. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still developing, which I thought was just right. They mentioned that he'd stabbed her multiple times and was under arrest, but that was about it.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting that happened in the Sharon Woods area - some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot and was in pretty bad shape. There were no suspects or arrests yet, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was real short, and I'm guessing it was because the victim was a minority and the neighborhood was a minority one too. I've noticed before that the media doesn't give the same attention to crimes involving minorities as they do to crimes involving white people. For example, if a white kid goes missing, the media is all over it, but if a minority person is a victim, it's like it barely makes the news.\n\nThey also had a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They had some details about where it might have happened and what kind of bullet was used - a .22 caliber from a rifle, I think. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that could lead to the shooter's arrest.\n\nNext up was a story about the weather forecast for the weekend, which sounded pretty typical for Columbus - rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with highs in the mid to low eighties. They made it clear that this was just a teaser to keep us watching, so we'd stick around.\n\nThey also had a report on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They said the perpetrator was a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. What struck me was how much they emphasized his race and how dark he was - it seemed a bit excessive, if you ask me.\n\nThe last story I remember was about Rene Rodriguez, a guy who'd been convicted of being a big-time marijuana dealer from Texas. He'd been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute weed to Ohio from Texas. I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve by saying \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" - maybe they thought it sounded harsher or something. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's something unbreakable between brothers – a connection that can't be broken or undone. This bond is made up of tons of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty – to name just a few. Brothers know each other in a way that nobody else does, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. In tough times, this bond really shows its true colors, whether it's good or bad. But with these emotions comes a price. Part of understanding this bond is dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you can stare a brother in the face and see your own reflection staring back, you see yourself as you really are, not as others see you. It's in their actions and the results of those actions that you find out who they really are. In the classic novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this idea, and all the crazy emotions that come with it. The two boys go on a wild adventure through a super vivid landscape, but it all ends in disaster. A huge mix of bitter disappointment and intense pride comes to a head, and only one brother makes it out alive. The author conveys this theme through the characters' actions, especially the main guy, Doodle, and their interactions with each other. The narrator also plays a key role by showing us how the protagonist feels about the world and how that affects his decisions.\n\nFor the protagonist, it all comes down to one main emotion: pride. From the very beginning, when he and his little brother Doodle first go on an adventure, to their final, disastrous trip, he's always feeling resentful towards Doodle. He wanted a brother who could keep up with him and learn all the cool stuff he knew, like holding his breath and climbing trees. He wanted someone to share his fun with, like racing to the top of a big pine tree and perching in the branches. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, so it was pretty unlikely he'd ever be able to do any of those things. The protagonist's dreams were crushed when that reality hit him. He even had thoughts of getting rid of Doodle, which is pretty messed up. But when Doodle smiles at him, all his anger melts away and he feels a surge of love. This shows that his anger wasn't as strong as he thought. Deep down, he's got a soft spot for his little bro.",
            "The brain is a super cool, super complicated machine that processes info all the time. As technology got way more advanced, people started using more and more fancy metaphors to describe the brain too. First, they compared it to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now it's like a computer. But, it's super important to keep in mind that these metaphors aren't perfect and can lead to some pretty wacky conclusions.\n\nSo, here's how the brain works: it gets all this sensory info from our eyes, ears, and other stuff, and turns it into electrical signals. Then, the brain starts messing with this info over and over in different ways. There are two main kinds of processing: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, your brain puts together tiny pieces of info like color and shape to figure out that it's a box. But then, your brain also uses what it already knows to help you figure out what you're looking at even faster.\n\nBut, there's another step - the brain decides how important the info is and whether you should be paying attention to it or not. Like, you're walking down the street and you see a bunch of blades of grass, but your brain doesn't make you notice them because they're not super important. But, if someone calls out your name in a crowded room, your brain is all like, \"Hey, I should pay attention to that!\"\n\nNow, for the brain to work, it needs to store info somehow. There are different types of memory, like short-term and long-term, and sensory memory. When we first get info, we need to encode it, which is like translating it into a language the brain can understand. For example, if you see a word, your brain can figure out what it looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means. Then, the brain has to keep that info stored somehow. Scientists think that short-term memory works because it's like a special electrical signal that loops through a bunch of neurons for a little while. Long-term memory, on the other hand, might be stored in the structure of special proteins in the brain.\n\nThere are a bunch of different theories about how the brain stores knowledge, some based on how people remember things, some based on computer science, and some based on brain stuff. One theory is that the brain is like a big network with nodes that represent ideas and concepts, and the nodes are all connected because they're related. For example, if you think of the word \"chair,\" your brain might also think of \"table,\" which might remind you of \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and the effects of the capitalistic system in his dystopian novel Brave New World. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, who dictates their ideology. By looking at the book through the lens of Marxist theory, we can see that Huxley is questioning the growth of these systems. Marxist ideas like homogeny and reification are sprinkled throughout the novel, showing that Huxley is saying that these systems have some major flaws.\n\nCapitalism is also criticized in the novel through the concept of false consciousness. This is where people are kept in the dark about the real relationship between different classes in society, and they're more worried about their own gain. It's like the World Controller has a tight grip on the common folks, making them want to buy, spend, and indulge in stuff. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are basically robots, doing what they're told without any free will of their own. They're conditioned with hypnopædia to be obsessed with consuming and spending. The World Controller is behind all of this, making the lower classes think they're part of the system, when really they're just pawns.\n\nThe idea of hegemony is also used in the novel, where a small group of people are in control of the whole society. The lower classes are completely clueless about this, they're just 'buying into' an ideology that helps keep the system going. The upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, know what's going on, but they just go along with it. But not everyone is like that, some characters like Bernard see through the system, but they're the exception.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are basically non-existent. The characters are pretty shallow, even the main ones, and they don't really have any depth. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and individuality. Love and strong emotions are non-existent, and people just go through the motions. It's all pretty superficial, with guys commenting on girls' looks and girls talking about their sex lives. The fact that everyone's okay with their place in society shows how capitalism is affecting people's lives. They're all just following the rules and doing what they're told, like the proletariat in Marxist theory, who are told they're better than everyone else as long as they keep consuming and obeying.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for like two and a half years now, which is basically four and a half semesters of trying to navigate this campus. For many of us, getting around here can be a major pain. My freshman year, I was stuck in East Halls dorm, which is basically as far east as you can go without hitting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Going to classes in places like the Willard building, which is literally in the middle of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when it's all gross outside. I talked to an alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, East Halls was basically its own separate entity from the rest of the school. There used to be this huge empty space between it and the rest of campus, but now it's all been filled in with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder and harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? On a college campus, it's gotta be the bicycle. But, let's be real, having a bike isn't enough - students need to actually ride them, and the campus needs to be set up to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend who just got back into biking after a few years off, and he was saying how he had no idea why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" he said. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for your body, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and get 30 miles or more out of it - all while getting some exercise. I now live off campus, which is basically as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I've got class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. Riding a bike cuts that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always the easiest road to travel on, bike or no bike. I've gotta say, walking has its pros, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up way too much of my time. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's just more time than I can spare."

Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",

Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I'm planning on pursuing a degree in social work with the ultimate goal of working for the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can help kids who've been mistreated or neglected and support families in need. Some values that'll guide me in this career path are service, respect, and being committed to improving relationships between people and myself. I genuinely believe that these values aren't just crucial for social workers, but also for me as a person.\n\nGrowing up, I've always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which path to take. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed a lot of people running away from their problems and some using less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. I wanted to make a change, so I decided to major in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still unsure of my future. One summer, I met a sixteen-year-old kid who had come to my friend's place to escape his abusive home life. The next day, he called the cops, so I went to his house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and explained my concerns, telling them about my degree in Psychology. They asked me to talk to the parents, and when I did, they seemed pretty nervous and made excuses for their son's behavior. That experience made me realize that I really want to work in social work, helping families like that one.\n\nAnother important value for social work is social justice. We claim that everyone's an individual, but in reality, we're all about following the crowd. If we mourn people who are different, then why do we try to fit in? I'm all about being myself and not limiting myself to what others think is normal. I've always stood up for what I believe in – like when I colored my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that express me, got my ears pierced, joined the GSBA, and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fighting for it.",
            "This paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on genetic information passed down through heredity and medical factors affecting health, while the sociocultural model examines environmental connections and their effects on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. Our review explores these models and digs into the research chosen to better understand and explain them. A critique of the research and its findings highlights their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental health issue, or a sleep disorder stemming from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders tied to another mental disorder are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulties maintaining adequate or quality sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. The sociocultural implications of these disorders are vast, as they can significantly impact daily life, including work, education, and routine tasks.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited factors, and physical aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. When the GABAA receptor is activated, it promotes sleep, while inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. An issue or absence with this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. The sociocultural significance of this study lies in the potential genetic inheritance of the receptor, which could naturally regulate sleep and disrupt it if altered. This can have far-reaching consequences for daily life, including school, work, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This paper explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects how the brain processes sound. First, we'll define CAPD and explain what it means for people who have it. Then, we'll discuss the signs that point to a diagnosis of CAPD, known as \"red flags\". Lastly, we'll talk about ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can help a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD is a disorder where the brain doesn't work properly when it comes to processing sound. It's not about being deaf or hearing impaired, but about the brain not being able to separate sounds or filter out background noise like it should. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain has trouble translating what they hear into something that makes sense.\n\nThe idea of CAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers started studying kids with communication problems. In 1954, a team in Italy was already developing tests for these kids, and by 1961, a scientist named Kimura came up with a way to understand how the brain processes multiple sounds at once. A big conference in 1977 got everyone talking about CAPD and sparked more research.\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble in different areas, like not being able to tell where sounds are coming from or hearing two sounds at the same time. They might have trouble recognizing patterns, like when someone's voice changes or when sounds get mixed up. They might even have trouble figuring out the order of sounds. Other issues include trouble with understanding sarcasm, getting stuck on one sound while another sound is playing, or making sense of sound clues.\n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors use a mix of observing how they behave and testing their hearing skills. This can involve questionnaires, watching how they respond to different sounds, and more in-depth tests that record how the ear responds to sound. Unfortunately, there's no one test that works perfectly for everyone, and there's no known cause for CAPD. Some tests give people a bunch of sounds at once and ask them to pick out certain ones, while others use special equipment to see how the ear responds to sound signals.",
            "It seems like the play Twelfth Night says that using disguises can be super helpful in keeping a secret for a long time, but in the end, you're gonna have to give it up or risk losing yourself in the process. The thing is, it's really hard to stop deceiving people without hurting those around you. Some might not even care that you lied, but others can get pretty mad when they find out. So, it's like, you have to choose between keeping your own identity or keeping your friends and family on your side.  In Twelfth Night, the whole thing with disguising yourself as the opposite gender gets even more complicated because it brings up a lot of other questions. For example, why do people feel like they need to change who they really are just to fit in? In Viola's case, she's just trying to protect herself from bad stuff, so she pretends to be a guy. And it works at first, but it also cuts her off from the people who could help her.\n\nAs Viola is trying to avoid getting hurt, she becomes so good at pretending that Olivia starts to think she's actually a guy named Sebastian, and falls in love with her. Viola's also dealing with some weird feelings for Orsino, who's also into her, but thinks she's a boy. I guess this might seem progressive, but it's kinda like Twelfth Night is saying that deception can help people figure out their real feelings. Like, maybe Olivia and Orsino are hiding some stuff about themselves that Viola/Cesario makes them face. For instance, is Olivia into Cesario because he's a guy, or is she actually into girls in secret? I don't think it's the second one, because Olivia's character seems to be making fun of people who judge others based on looks. We can tell because Olivia goes from having a crush on Cesario to thinking of him as her brother in, like, two seconds.",
            "People have noticed that German colonial rule was pretty brutal, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocides in German South West Africa. But let's be real, it's hard to sum up an entire colonial empire with just a few words. German colonial rule was super varied, both in terms of its policies and how it was run, and it covered a huge amount of different geography. When it comes to education, the German colonies were all over the place, too. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a bunch of super smart and literate Africans. German eduction efforts in places like Kamerun and other colonies even got some good reviews from people writing back then. \n\nBut South West Africa (now Namibia) was a different story altogether. Unlike in East Africa, where the government was all about setting up schools and educating the locals, in South West Africa, the job of educating the natives was pretty much left to missionary groups that didn't have much support from the government. That being said, the government did invest a lot in educating Europeans in the colony and even supported missionary schools more. These educational policies had some long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule was over. Meanwhile, other German colonies had a bunch of literate and educated Africans, but in South West Africa, the majority of the population was basically untouched and illiterate. There were a bunch of social, economic, and political factors that contributed to this different experience. This paper is trying to explore those factors and dive deeper into how settlers and colonial officials felt about native Africans.\n\nThere's a whole lot of research on education in the German colonial empire, but most of it is in German and from the early 20th century. These early studies mostly focused on describing the educational systems in the colonies. Later, more English-language studies came out that compared education in the different German colonies and got into the nitty-gritty details. These studies showed just how different the educational systems were in each colony. The most important study on this topic is probably Cohen's look at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compared the two colonies and figured out what made their educational systems so different. He thinks it's because South West Africa had a big settler population, which made their education system unique.\n\nCompared to the other colonies, South West Africa had a pretty mild climate, except for all the desert. This made it a more comfortable place for Europeans to live, which is why there were almost 15,000 of them there by 1913. In contrast, only 5,336 settlers lived in the next biggest colony, East Africa.",
            "There are so many genres of popular music now that it's a real challenge to make a definitive list. It gets even worse because even the main genres like rock, country, and jazz have tons of sub-genres within them. Heavy Metal, which started about 40 years ago, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. It's diverse because it can express a wide range of emotions, mostly on the darker side. And when people first started messing around with it, they realized just how flexible it was and started creating their own sub-genres, which just kept branching out even more. Today it's tough to figure out what heavy metal even is because there are so many different niches, and it's incorporated ideas from other genres. To understand heavy metal today, you have to understand what it's all about and why it's a movement and not just a genre.\n\nHeavy metal is basically a movement all about darkness. It's like the ultimate \"more-is-better\" thing – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more showmanship. And it's not just about raw emotion; the musicians in metal bands know their stuff and it shows in their music. Another cool thing about heavy metal is that it's heavily influenced by psychedelic substances. The psychedelic scene back in the 70s was a wild time and it led to some crazy, trippy music. People used the drugs as a way to get their creativity flowing, and a lot of those songs reflect the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Later metal bands took some of that dark, intense vibe from the Romantic Era and ran with it. You can see it in the lyrics of songs like Helter Skelter, which is actually considered one of the first heavy metal songs ever. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier side, and the Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy and intense. They put it on The White Album, and now it's a classic example of the darker side of music.",
            "I was reading about this dude Henri Rousseau and how he was making his own dreams come true - literally and figuratively - back in the day. His painting, \"The Dream\" from 1910, isn't just about some chick in awe of this fantastical land she's visiting in her dreams, it's also about Rousseau's own hopes and aspirations as an artist. He started off wanting people to recognize him, accept him, and give him props as a painter, but he was stuck in a weird internal struggle. See, he wanted to either play by the rules and do what other artists were doing so he'd get noticed by the art world crowd, or just be himself and forge his own path. \"The Dream\" is like the ultimate representation of this internal conflict that Rousseau faced his whole career.\n\nTo really get what's going on with this painting, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life. He was born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, and his dad was this tinsmith who had a pretty good life. Rousseau didn't get any formal art training; instead, he worked for the town as a toll service guy until he was 40. He got called a \"customs inspector,\" but that's not exactly what he did. After losing his wife and eight kids, he turned to painting to escape his pain and start fresh. Unlike other artists of his time who painted all sappy and romantic about peasants, Rousseau was a true folk painter who just wanted to live the average guy's life.\n\nIt's not surprising that Rousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world, given that he was basically a self-taught painter who started late in life, and there were all these other talented artists around at the same time. He didn't get any real recognition until around the same time that Matisse was building his rep as an artist. Jan Gordon, the author of Modern French Painters, said that while Matisse was trying to avoid painting something boring, Rousseau was all about painting something so normal that people would think he was a \"real\" artist. It's pretty deep, man.",
            "A lot of deep thinkers have said that ethics and aesthetics are super connected, like two peas in a pod. I think there's a reason for this. John Keats said it best in that one poem, \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we know comes from learning or experiencing stuff, but it seems like we actually get ethics and aesthetics without needing a teacher to tell us about it. Both ethics and aesthetics are about describing, not dictating - like trying to figure out why a work of art is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than making up a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. \n\nTo get to the point, you can't fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful just by talking about it. Trying to analyze the Mona Lisa might be all about stuff like the foreground and background, but those things don't really tell you why it's so amazing. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say something like, \"There's just something about it,\" and then give a more complicated explanation. I think that's because art and morals can't be reduced to just describing their qualities. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" and I think that's true for ethics too. No matter how much you describe the properties of a work of literature, there's still something left that's hard to put into words. I think that's the same with ethics - it's like this mysterious, otherworldly thing that we can experience but can't fully explain. \n\nI think that's why ethics and art are so closely connected - we experience them both at this deep, unexplainable level. This is especially true for literature, as McKean said, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. It's like it's a part of life itself.\" We all experience life with values, and that's why literature is important to us because of the values we find there.",
            "Germany's strong presence in the world today is really something to be reckoned with. It's a country with its own unique culture that stretches from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from Köln on the Rhine River through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It shouldn't be a surprise that Germany's culture has roots from all over since it's made up of different tribes and sources. \n\nThe land where the Germans originated is called Germania, but its name's meaning is a total mystery. Some experts think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. However, others believe it might have come from the Gauls themselves, who used the word 'Germanus' to describe their neighbors. Julius Caesar first used this word to distinguish between the Gauls he conquered and the Germanic tribes he fought against. In his book about the Gallic Wars, he wrote that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly battling the Gauls in almost daily fights. But where exactly the name 'German' came from is still a debate - some say it's from the spear they used in battle, the 'ger', while others think it might be from the Old Irish word 'garim', which means 'to shout', implying the Germans were pretty loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' back in AD 98. He described the Germans as being aboriginal, not mixed with other races, and living on ships when they wanted to leave their homeland. He wondered why anyone would leave a place like Rome for a wild and harsh land like Germania, unless it was their home. So, the Romans didn't exactly conquer Germania, but they did send out their soldiers to trade and fight there. The Germanic tribes started appearing in the early first century and lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I was just staring blankly at something in front of me, my mind not really paying attention. I was in a pretty robotic state, just taking it all in without thinking about it too much. My thoughts were zipping in and out so fast I couldn't really catch any of them - it was like my brain was just going through the motions. It was actually kind of weird, like I didn't really have any real thoughts of my own, just a bunch of stuff happening in my head.\n\nRecently I picked up this art book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain after some advice from an artist I was working with. I've wanted to draw since I was like six and this book teaches you all the basics, from what a pencil even is to how the brain works when you're looking at lines. One trick it shows you is to draw a square around whatever you're looking at to make it simpler. It's like turning a super complicated picture into something you can actually handle.\n\nAt the time, I was staring at this bowl of fruit and just couldn't get my brain to think about it in a more simple way. I was so overwhelmed that I just stood there staring in awe. I guess you could say the great artists like Picasso went through different phases - blue, green, all that stuff. If I wanted to be a \"real\" artist, I guess this was the start of my picture, my story, my thing - which I thought of as Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up my pencil and started to draw, my hand moving over the paper, but then I kind of snapped out of it and smacked my hand on the toilet handle. I was trying to, uh, take care of some business, but this brown package was stuck and not going anywhere. I had to use some pretty creative language to describe it. Finally, after a few more attempts, I managed to get it to move. I was still in a pretty calm state, so I just stood there for a second, then I started wrapping the toilet paper around my hand like a mummy. I know it sounds weird, but I was just in this really peaceful, introspective place. I stood up, bent down, and then my hand went into the toilet like I was putting a big turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving...",
            "I went to the dentist and got five teeth pulled so I can get braces by Thursday, but it turns out I don't have any teeth left for them to glue on! The laughing gas really got to me, and I started seeing double everywhere. It was just like that episode of The Simpsons where Lisa gets braces and laughing gas – I kept feeling like I was in the scene where she dreams about The Beatles. The whole time I was numb, I kept hearing my inner voice singing 'I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons!' over and over again. I don't really remember much from the procedure except for the weird needle dream and the last two teeth getting pulled. When I got home, I felt like a chipmunk – I hate being numb, especially when I lost feeling in most of my face, including my ear. Now that's all over, and I'm looking forward to some Tofutti ice cream and sweet potato mush – AlexD suggested I try liquid prime ribs, but I'm not so sure. I have to go through the pain again for braces on Thursday, and I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nI tried to dye my hair blue today in art class, but it didn't work on my dark hair, so I have to highlight it first. I'm hoping to get it done before the Styx concert tomorrow. I used a Sharpie to dye a strand of my hair blue, and surprisingly, it turned out really well, but it dried out my hair a bit. I'm not sure if it'll wash out, so I might have to dye it a lighter blue color. My advisor, Brian, is a Gunker almost, just like Sporko, and he's really knowledgeable about hair dye. I drew him as a rock star on Wednesday, and he's going to help me with my hair tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow is the last day of portrait camp, but I'll be back for the landscape class soon – maybe the 14th or 17th. I'll need all the luck I can get for my hair and the concert.\n\nNow, let's talk about something serious – teenagers are dying behind the wheel. It's a deadly trend that's hard to ignore. Several factors contribute to this problem, including the fact that the teen brain isn't ready for the hazards of driving. Inexperience is another major factor – it not only causes fatal accidents but also increases the risk of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road. And if teens are driving with their peers, which they often do, the risks are even higher. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nStates like California have tried to increase safety by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers. But these measures are just stopgap solutions – the real issue is that young drivers are, by all statistical markers, not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, and his research suggests that people under 19 or 20 tend to take risks for the thrill of it. It makes sense to delay driving until this tendency has leveled out. If we keep issuing licenses to young teens, we'll keep seeing deadly accidents and the death toll will rise to staggering proportions. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's kids will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation to address this issue would be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes, but no one under 18 could get a driver's license. A provisional permit could still be issued before the full license, and a certain number of practical training hours would be required. The number of hours could be based on what most states currently require – like California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country. It's not a new idea, but it's one that's long overdue.",
            "So, I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films and decided to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. These movies are pretty cool because they use some seriously creative editing to create illusions. I mainly focused on studying the poetry behind most of these trick films and figuring out how some of the later ones evolved from the early ones. Generally, trick films from around that time stick to a pretty basic structure – they're set-bound, stuck within a frontal proscenium, don't feature any camera movement, and use long and medium shots. However, some films from the early 1900s started experimenting and breaking these rules by introducing new elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that all these trick films have in common is that they're filmed within a set on a frontal proscenium stage. The camera never moves from its spot, which is pretty common for early films and was actually inspired by theatre and vaudeville/magic acts. But one of the downsides of using a stage is that actors in trick films can only move left or right, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Take the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), for example, where the actors come in from the right side and just walk back and forth along the horizontal axis, even when they're out of frame, the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nThe way these films are composed also means that shots are mostly long shots and occasionally medium shots, but never close-ups. This is similar to how theatre and vaudeville work, where you see the whole performance at once. Since actors never move towards the camera, you never get close-ups. Most early trick films also follow a pretty simple rule: one conceptual shot is equal to one film, which is why most of them are pretty short – around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It's not exactly a compelling narrative either, mostly just short tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single shot might actually be several physical shots joined together to create an illusion, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a close look reveals where the physical shot with Mary's fake severed head starts, even though the whole film is one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "So, I'm telling you about John Taylor of Caroline, this guy who was a total die-hard Republican. He was all about his farm work, but that and his short stint in politics made him a legend for speaking his mind on personal freedoms and government stuff. His big thing was preserving and promoting agriculture, and that influenced how he thought about pretty much everything, including the government and the law. He was all about keeping it real and not letting the government get too big or powerful.\n\nTaylor thought the US had a chance to create the ultimate system since we didn't have any old traditions holding us back. He was all about the natural rights of people and how they're all connected - if one gets taken away, they all do, and it makes the rest less valuable. He said that in a normal state of nature, the strong and mean guys are the ones who get ahead, but that's not how it should be in a civilized society.\n\nTo make a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should be made up of good and bad stuff, like how people are. He was super strict about his idea of good and evil and said that as long as the government is run by humans, it'll have its own set of good and bad qualities. He thought good principles were about protecting private property, helping out farmers, and keeping capitalism in check. He believed a government with good principles would work fairly no matter who's in charge, even if they're just trying to do what's good for themselves. But he also thought that self-interest is just a normal part of being human, and it's only bad when it hurts others. He said a good government needs to keep an eye on people's natural bad tendencies and make sure they don't get out of control.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of other Republicans back then, wanted the government to interpret the Constitution really strictly. He wanted a super small government with only the powers that the Constitution says it has. He knew that a big government is expensive and might turn into a dictatorship, but he also thought that just following the letter of the law without thinking about the people who wrote it could be bad too. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was like a blueprint for the US, because it says we're a bunch of independent states, not just one country.",
            "Going back to the graph, it's pretty clear that the number of commuter log submissions dropped dramatically in the third month of the project. It was pretty discouraging, and I'm still trying to figure out why that happened. Winter had just hit the New England campus, which probably explains some of the decline in people biking or walking to school. At the same time, it was the end of the fall semester, and people were super busy finishing up their schoolwork and dealing with grades. Filling out the commuter log just slipped their minds, I guess. Plus, December is the start of the holiday season, and everyone was either busy or on winter break, so it's no wonder that the log submissions were way down. Classes didn't resume until late January, which maybe explains the low numbers for that month too. But the low numbers in February still don't make sense. We were worried that people's initial enthusiasm for the project would wear off over time, and that's exactly what happened. We tried to combat this with Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did end up boosting log submissions for that month. So, we faced a couple of major challenges: keeping people engaged when they naturally lose interest, and dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that come with higher ed. \n\nAnother big problem is that people love driving their cars because it's so convenient and independent, which is just part of our culture. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we need to offer some serious incentives. We gave out gift cards to local places, but it would have been cool to see how bigger prizes, like a free bike or hybrid car, would have affected participation. That might have helped us avoid that dip in engagement. The prizes we offered didn't change over time, and while the gift cards were nice at first, announcing bigger prizes in December and January might have made a huge difference. We might have seen way higher participation rates instead of declining ones.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a super flexible security that's like a stock, but tracks an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets like an index fund.  You get the benefits of owning a single stock, like selling short and buying on margin, and the diversification of an index fund, but with lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund.  The downside is that you'll have to pay a commission on trades, just like with stocks.  On the plus side, there are tons of ETFs to choose from.  But, it's always smart to double-check the benefits, like diversification, to make sure they're really there and how much they're worth.  For this project, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is as good as owning a diversified portfolio of those 10 stocks.  We also want to know if there's a better way to mix and match those stocks for a better return and lower risk.\n\nTo make things simpler, we're only looking at the top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  These are the stocks that are included below.  To figure out how well these 10 stocks represent the entire ETF, we're calculating their Beta and Return as if they were the only stocks in the portfolio.  We're using the current percentages of the holdings to do this.  The chart below shows the results.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a return that's 6.11% higher than the ETF, which is a 16% increase.  It also shows that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is .12 lower than the ETF's Beta.  So far, it looks like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could be a better bet, but we need to make sure the difference is real and not just a fluke.  To do this, we're looking at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and comparing it to the ETF's standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's favorite poems is Dream-Land. In Dream-Land, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\", which he likely got from Virgil. But there's a catch - Virgil might not have been the first person to use this term. It's also possible that Poe borrowed it from another source, especially since he was super into German authors. \n\nThis is significant because it shows just how familiar Poe was with Goethe's writing. Some people, like Karl J. Arndt, think that Poe was even copying Goethe's style. Arndt wrote about this in his book Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. \n\nYou can find a whole poem called \"The King of Thulé\" in the second part of Goethe's famous poetic drama Faust. It's about a king who's really upset after his wife dies and gives him a special goblet. He starts drinking a lot and crying, and eventually decides it's time to die. He gives away all his stuff except the goblet and then jumps off a cliff. Sounds pretty similar to the King of Thule in Dream-Land, right? Maybe it's like a darker version of Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nFaust was also made into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thulé in The Pit and the Pendulum. Poe actually mentions Thulé twice in his writing - once in The Pit and the Pendulum and twice in Dream-Land. You could say that \"The King of Thule\" and Dream-Land are like two poems that go together. In Dream-Land, the speaker talks about how dark and lonely Thulé is, and how he's haunted by dead friends. It's like he's stepping into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a huge deal, and Poe must have known about him because of his respect for Tennyson. Poe said that he admired Tennyson, and Tennyson was really into Goethe. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in all the reproductions that were happening after the original publication. So, it's no surprise that Poe was influenced by Goethe's style.",
            "I've been wondering if a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could get punitive damages under California law if the store manager was really careless. He was told about the spill twice, but he didn't clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. A judge might not dismiss the customer's claim right away. To get punitive damages, the customer will have to show that the manager was super reckless and knew how bad his actions would be. The customer can argue that the manager should have known this because a bunch of other customers had slipped and fallen at the store before, and he still didn't do anything about it. Even though this isn't the strongest reason, it's a pretty good one, considering that six people had slipped and fallen in the store that year, and the manager still didn't take care of the problem.\n\nIt turns out that the manager, Paul Martin, was really relaxed about cleaning up the spill. On October 13th, one of his employees, Rich Wayne, told him about it, but Martin said he was on a break and didn't have time for customer complaints. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reminded him an hour later, and he gave the same response. An hour after that, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got really hurt. Before that, five other people had slipped and fallen in the store that year. Now Palmer is suing the store for money to cover her medical bills and some extra money to teach the store a lesson. We're thinking about whether to ask the judge to throw out that part of the lawsuit.\n\nIn California, a customer can get punitive damages if the store did something really bad on purpose or was super reckless and didn't care about the consequences. The law says that if the store didn't mean to hurt the customer, but still did something really bad, it's like they did it on purpose. This can happen if the store knew what they were doing would hurt someone, but they went ahead and did it anyway. A court said that's what happened in a case called Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the store was aware of the risks and still didn't do anything to prevent them.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, which got me thinking about how people view the religion.  One thing that really stuck out was the debate over whether Islam is actually a hostile faith - a question that's even more relevant now than back then.  Looking back on what's happened since 9/11, I've seen the media's attitude swing from being super negative to being super tolerant of Islam in the US.  I mean, can you imagine a presidential candidate with a Muslim background like Barack Obama in 2001?  It's crazy.\n\nWhat really got me was reading the Prophet's biography.  From what I knew, I thought Muhammad was all about forcing people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a totally different picture - he's more like a martyr who's humble and misunderstood.  People come to him because they're convinced by his teachings, not because he's forcing them to join.  It's weird, because there are some pretty cool similarities between Jesus and Muhammad's alleged miracles, like the time Muhammad fed a group of people with some mutton and milk.  But it's always bugging me that the writers of the biography seem to be trying to make Muhammad out to be this humble guy who doesn't need to prove anything.  It's like they're trying to take credit for Jesus' life and message by linking it to Muhammad.  \n \nI also have some issues with the way the stories in the biography are presented.  A lot of them are second-hand or third-hand accounts, which just makes me think they're not entirely trustworthy.  It's like they're trying to prove that people converted to Islam of their own free will, but it comes across as kinda suspicious.  What really gets my goat is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, godly guy who's humble and wise.  But the historical record says otherwise - and I wonder if Muslims today know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It appears that Jesus' teachings and the beliefs he held during his lifetime got lost in the shuffle as Christianity continued to evolve after he was gone.  If you look at the history of Christianity in general terms, you can see a pattern where the original teachings have gradually drifted away.  Nowadays, it's more and more clear that people are becoming more open-minded and there's a growing trend of progress.  While traditionalists will resist any change from what they were taught, their numbers might not be enough to sway the masses.  Within Christianity, a deeper understanding of history will grow over the coming years, and people will start to differentiate between the ideas that were added to the religion over time and what Jesus originally intended.  It might take a long time, decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  There will be a major shift in the way Christianity has been progressing.  The trend will reverse itself, moving backward until all that's left is the original stuff that Jesus brought to the world on behalf of God, before other thinkers started making their own claims.  When this shift starts spreading through the US and Europe, a lot of people will begin to worship in the same way they did back in Jesus' time, following his ideas alone.  The church as an institution will still be a major force, but because the theological clock will be turned back, the huge variety in Christianity will start to shrink into more and more uniformity of beliefs and practices.  Instead of seeing lots of differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, people will start to notice more and more similarities.  History is full of great reversals like this - think about how Christians used to be persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but then the empire became a Christian institution, or how our country went from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  A similar big reversal is coming in the Christian world, undoing history to get back to the source, and in the process, undoing the diversity that's developed over time.  A crucial part of this process will be understanding Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than taking them as literal statements.  So, what happened since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking way back into history, we can see that the only thing that existed was Judaism, which is the foundation for the Christian religion.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already at the core of Judaism.  But even back then, the Jewish population wasn't a single, unified group - they split into different factions, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of regular people.",
            "I think that The Jungle really brings out how selfish and self-centered people are deep down. They only care about themselves and making their own lives awesome, but they never think about anyone below them. This is shown in many ways in The Jungle. The owners and managers of the big factories are a total example of this. All they care about is making their companies huge and powerful. They don't even think about anyone or anything that gets in their way or gets harmed because of their stuff. Upton Sinclair is really good at painting a picture of just how bad the pollution from these factories is in his book. He says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's trying to show just how much damage all this pollution is causing. The owners don't care if anyone gets hurt. They don't care about all the smoke coming out of the factories or the gross stuff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also didn't care about their employees at all. They would do anything to make or save a little more money. \"So from the top to bottom the place is just a huge mix of jealousies and hatreds; there's no loyalty or decency anywhere, there's no place where a person counts for anything against a dollar\". They made their employees work super long hours and then would just get rid of loads of people without any notice or help finding a new job. During the time The Jungle is set in, there were hardly any laws to protect workers' safety or well-being. This let the managers and owners do whatever they wanted, making their employees speed up and work in terrible conditions. The people who lived and worked in Packingtown were basically expected to deal with the awful conditions, both on the job and at home. There were no organizations or agencies to help the workers. There were unions, but they often made more money off the poor workers than they helped them. The workers were treated so badly and had no way to escape the system of Packingtown that they were basically treated like slaves. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "A lot of authors use different techniques in their writing to get a specific emotion or attitude across to their readers. Some of these techniques work way better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of The Great Gatsby, uses a lot of these techniques in his novel. Sometimes, he pairs words together in a way that doesn't usually go together to create a certain vibe about a subject. Other times, he gives a certain meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. \n\nOne technique Fitzgerald uses often is building up a meaning for colors and then later using that meaning to remind readers of a particular feeling around an important thing. He does this with colors like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald starts giving meaning to white and gray and then later uses that meaning to create a certain feeling about something.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white and gray is all about uniformity and sameness. He shows this by using these colors a lot at the beginning of the novel. For example, everyone is always wearing white. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\", and even the settings are described with white and gray: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\". The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick gives his impression of Gatsby's party. Fitzgerald even defines these colors by using them to describe everyday, unimportant things like buildings, people, and names. \n\nAfter Fitzgerald has built up the meaning of white and gray, he starts using them to show how unimportant or boring something is. He does this by using these colors to describe Daisy, who used to be a bigger character, but now feels more like just a boring addition to the story. Fitzgerald does this by describing Daisy wearing white or gray, like when she's dressed in white in a little white roadster. The readers start to see her as just a part of the uniform, something that Gatsby wants and longs for. He does this again and again to make this point about Daisy being a boring addition. For example, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and she's wearing white again before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is super fertile due to its pleasant, sunny climate. They grow all sorts of yummy stuff like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a huge demand for organic food in the area, with lots of people waiting months to get their hands on it. People also love buying organic eggs and milk. Many of these farms even let you come and explore their operations, hike, or go birdwatching - it's like getting a free mini-vacation. This type of farm can help the landowner get government cash while keeping the land nice and healthy, which is awesome because it lets people visit and learn stuff.\n\nNot only does this type of farming make a bunch of money, but it also brings in all sorts of cool wildlife because they don't use yucky chemicals. However, it's way more work and can be more expensive than regular farming because you have to get rid of pests and weeds the hard way and manually fertilize the soil. You also might lose more crops, and a small farm can't compete with those giant, industrial farms when it comes to efficiency. They also have to do extra stuff like planting special crops to keep the soil healthy and removing invasive species, which costs more time and money.\n\nThis land I chose for this example is in an awesome spot near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan is all over the area, and they're still reviewing it. It's home to over a hundred species of plants and animals, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, which are all in danger of disappearing. This land has been home to Native Americans for a super long time and was later used for cattle ranching and selling cordwood in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it probably used to be used for grazing and wood production for a while.\n\nI picked a piece of land from a real estate site and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might be able to do to make farming more affordable and still save the wildlife. I chose an organic farm in the same area as a model of what someone might try to do with this land.",
            "Culture's impact on a negotiation is significant. Culture isn't just what it is, but also what it isn't and what it signifies. It's not a single, unified thing, nor is it the same across the board. General statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are way too broad and pretty simplistic. It's more productive for a negotiator to understand the importance of a culture to the specific negotiation at hand and how that culture's attitude will affect the discussion. When you encounter a foreign culture, you experience it in a way that relates to your own, which leads to comparisons.\n\nGetting to know a foreign culture or mindset can involve studying its history, understanding its biases, or learning about its traditions. Rather than judging or trying to change it, you need to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when negotiating. If you're in a weaker position, showing respect for the other culture and its traditions can really help you break down any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture isn't just about national or international differences. Companies often have their own unique corporate culture, which can vary greatly from one company to another. For instance, some companies might expect employees to work long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. Look at how different companies in the same country can have distinct corporate cultures, from dress codes to communication styles to hiring practices. Some companies might even have different corporate cultures within the same company, depending on the region or location.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is also key, because it helps you understand the \"why\" behind it. If saving face or maintaining harmony are important in a culture, you can bet that a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company or superior to get ahead in a negotiation. On the other hand, a negotiator from a culture that values a tough bargain won't necessarily settle for a quick agreement. Knowing these generalities beforehand is crucial before sitting down at the negotiating table. However, it's also really helpful to learn something about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation go smoothly.",
            "There's this famous phrase from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" It's actually the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. We're also gonna look at Thomas Aquinas, and since their ideas pretty much support the same concept, we'll assume they're both right about God being the one from the Bible. If their God wasn't from the Bible, it'd be hard to compare their arguments since they're really trying to prove one specific version of God exists. So, we're gonna start by thinking they both believe in the same God.\n\nTo get a feel for their ideas, let's look at St. Anselm's first. Anselm says that we can figure out God by looking inside ourselves. He thinks that since we can't really imagine a world without God, it's proof that God exists in our minds. This idea can get a bit confusing, but basically, Anselm's saying that we can know God just by thinking about what we already know to be true. That's kinda like having faith – it's not about needing proof, it's about trusting what's inside your head. This is a big deal in Christianity because it's about trusting in something that might not be proven.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas took a different approach. He thinks we can prove God exists using logic and facts, no faith needed. This would actually be pretty cool for spreading the word of Christianity because people wouldn't need to believe something just because they're told to – they could believe it because it makes sense. Aquinas came up with five separate arguments to show that God must exist because of the way the world works: change, cause and effect, things that are temporary, levels of perfection, and things working together in harmony. Each one basically says that since we can see how all these things need a creator, we can know God must be that creator without even seeing God.",
            "Sometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would eventually be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, this prince made the choice to leave behind worldly life and achieve enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism. Over time, the teachings have led to the formation of the most traditional form of Buddhism, which is often referred to as Theravada. As the religion has aged – it's now around 2500 years old – it's undergone a lot of changes. This is clear when looking at countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada community has developed unique traditions and celebrations, like the water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is observed by both monks and lay followers, but interestingly, it wasn't something that Buddha himself ever taught about. The differences between past and present can be seen in both the surface-level customs and the core teachings of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its guiding principles over the years, both when influenced by external forces, like those from outside the Buddhist community, and internal ones, like changes within the community itself.\n\nTo make sense of this discussion, it's essential to understand some key concepts that will be used throughout. 'Internal' refers to forces generated by members of the Buddhist community, regardless of whether they're monks or lay followers. 'External' forces come from outside the Buddhist community. A 'hostile' force is one that aims to harm or damage the community, often due to a negative perception of Buddhism. A 'benign' force, on the other hand, doesn't intend to harm or help the community, but may end up doing so as a byproduct.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to explore the fundamentals of Theravada Buddhism – the core teachings that it's built upon. Buddhists find refuge in the 'triple gem': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the three baskets (Tripitaka) of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas (Buddhist teachings), the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the more abstract, metaphysical concepts of Buddhism, such as the idea that there is no permanent soul (Anatta), that life is marked by inherent suffering (Dukkha), and that everything is impermanent (Anicca). Recognizing these concepts is crucial in breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), will cease when one achieves enlightenment. In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for living are outlined. For lay followers, there are five basic principles to follow (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral behavior, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, must adhere to many more rules. The core of Buddhism, however, is the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico were at odds for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, due to a longstanding rivalry. This tension was at its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the US defeated Mexico and took control of Texas and the American Southwest (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). Many other conflicts occurred between the two nations, but they eventually cooled off just before World War I. The initial conflict started with disagreements over issues like religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThis situation isn't unique - many neighboring nations have similar rivalries. When countries share a border, their conflicting interests can lead to the formation of opposing stances between them. The US and Mexico aren't the only example of this; other nations with a history of border disputes often have similar issues. David M. Pletcher notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only Latin American nations that have had long-standing diplomatic troubles with the US (1977, p. 41).\n\nOne major point of contention between the US and Mexico was their religious differences, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm points out that Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries, just as they were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century (2001, p. 86). Like the ideological struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, this rivalry was based on differing values and interests, but in this case, they stemmed from the US and Mexico's contrasting religious preferences. This distrust was inherited from their colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, making it difficult for the two nations to establish friendly relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during this 57-year period, mostly related to territorial issues, such as border raids and frontier problems. Border bandits and outlaws from American towns were a significant problem until the US and Mexico took military action to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). Schmitt notes that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and eventually ended as the US shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (1974, p. 109-110).",
            "It's been 15 years since I was taken down by a sickness that caught me completely off guard. Back then I was working as a nurse because, as a kid, I didn't have the stability and security I craved. People kept saying things like 'You'll always find work - people will always get sick' so I picked nursing over my true passions, which were science and journalism. Even though I had dreams of being both, it was easier to rely on a steady income. \n\nI'm now 46 and single, broke, and unable to work because of this illness. I've been living off Social Security Disability for 15 years, and to this day, I have nothing that's truly mine. Each day feels like a struggle, an assault on my sense of security, safety, and confidence. Nothing feels secure anymore, but one thing I know for sure - if it weren't for my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. Even when disaster strikes, you don't feel as strong as you thought you'd be.\n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected emergencies, big and small. No matter how prepared you are, some things are just too overwhelming to handle on your own. The U.S. needs to stop putting all its eggs in the government basket, which is crumbling anyway. Instead, I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, to ask for help without hesitation.\n\nThe U.S. Conservatives keep talking about rugged individualism, but the truth is, our ancestors' success in tough times wasn't about going it alone - it was about compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources. The pioneers who trekked across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by themselves.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have a disaster kit stocked with first aid supplies, water purifiers, and emergency essentials. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, and canned goods. If you have the means and resources for a small farm, that's a great idea too. But while you're at it, take the time to know your neighbors - it might just save you in a pinch.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there any rules or limitations that affect the direction of evolutionary change? Even back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that zoologists had barely started to think about describing simple organic shapes using math. Nowadays, it's still pretty much the same. Lately, scientists have tried using math to figure out how mollusks' skeletons grow and change over time. Our research is focused on using math to understand how animals like Prunum change and grow. We're combining math with experiments to learn more about how evolution works.\n\nWe looked at X-ray pictures of Prunum shells to find patterns that we could use to create models of how shells might change over time. We fed this data into a computer program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995) and used it to imagine how shells could be different. These ideas are being combined with other studies to help us understand how big changes happened in this group of animals.\n\nIf you think about a shell as a tube that moves through space over time, it's kind of like a big spiral staircase. The different turns of the shell are called whorls, and they're connected by a line called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, and the other whorls are called the spire. The pointy top of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles - apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. A way to count the whorls is to look at the shell from the top and draw a line where the first suture starts. Then, we count the whorls from that line, estimating a quarter of a whorl if it's not a whole number.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through space and time as the animal builds its shell. We can track the path of these holes by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. This path can be represented mathematically and graphically. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how it affects the way the shell grows.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant deaths in Indonesia hasn't really changed over the past ten years.  It's weird, because the country is doing pretty well in other areas like water and sanitation, but when it comes to keeping babies and moms safe, they're way behind where they need to be by 2015. I'm gonna get into the reasons later, but basically, it's time to make the whole health system stronger instead of just focusing on individual programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress with getting medical workers at births, with 72% of births meeting this target now. But it's a little misleading because they include midwives who can't do much if something goes wrong, so a lot of moms still die from things like bleeding after delivery. Plus, it's not like they're getting better care for the little kids either - in fact, they're getting worse. We don't have all the info on post-birth care, but it's pretty clear that's another problem area.\n\nC-sections are still way too low, only 4%, and it's even worse in rural areas where it's only 2%. That shows how uneven healthcare is around the country, with mostly rich people getting the good stuff. And to make things worse, there's a huge gap in healthcare access between the poor and the rich - it's like a 27% difference. So, the poor people are basically stuck without access to healthcare because they can't afford it.\n\nNow we have to figure out how to fix this, and the main question is whether to focus on improving specific programs or strengthening the whole health system. It's tempting to do the specific programs because they're more focused, but they also have some major drawbacks. For one thing, it's hard to get funding for other areas when someone's getting a lot of attention for one thing. And with too many programs going on at once, you end up with a bunch of duplicate services and a huge mess of paperwork and supplies.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the high society of the time.  However, two novels that stray from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels feature an element of mystery and a penchant for the bizarre, which is unusual for the period, and this adds depth to the characters; giving insight into their motives and emotions.  \n\nAnd then, a jumble of confusing ideas started racing through his mind.  He was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing loudly; the words they said were still echoing in his ears; and when he suddenly snapped back to reality, he realized he was talking to them.  Then, the sound of gunfire startled him, and he was bombarded by a cacophony of screams and shouts.  Everything around him was a blur, and he felt an overwhelming sense of pain that refused to subside.\n\nThese two novels often use mystery through dreamlike states, though the content and purpose varies in each case.  In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal Oliver's innermost thoughts, his fears, and his awareness of the harsh reality around him.  When Oliver is shot in the end, the scene is revisited in chapter 28, and he relives it vividly, as if it were a dream, while desperately trying to find help.  The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as his dire circumstances, which are evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses; he's unaware of the 'unseen force' that's taking him away.  His despair is replayed before him, now constant and linked with fear rather than shock.  With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises as to whose actions led to his misfortune, since it was certainly not his own.  This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, not even his own life, as he fails to even attempt to take control of an event's outcome.  A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin had broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and lose his ability to react.  Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\nThe day passed all too quickly – it was gone before he knew it – and night fell again, long and oppressive in its silence, but brief in its fleeting moments.",
            "I used to work at an after-school program where I helped elementary students with their schoolwork. My specialty was English and reading, but I tried to assist them in whatever subjects they were struggling with. I was asked to work with this kid named Adrian, who was having some serious trouble reading. At first, I thought he was just having a tough time, but it turned out that something weird was going on - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly, but others were way off. I knew he was of Latino descent, but he spoke perfect English, which was really weird. We struggled to figure out what was going on until the day I met his mom. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish, and I was barely learning it at the time. We managed to communicate somehow, but it hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized that Adrian knew how to read just fine - he just didn't know the English alphabet. I don't know if that insight really helped him much, but I hope he's doing okay now.\n\nI share that story to highlight the problem of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think - even if a kid speaks perfect English, reading can still be super tough. Everyone agrees that this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: one-on-one tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no single answer. Some people swear by the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or a combination of all of the above. The key is to try a bit of everything.\n\nThe dual language system is a great idea - not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. It's been shown that kids in these programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of people are scared that it's a waste of resources, but that's not true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from them. So, how do we make it happen? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But we can definitely have special aides, tutors, or whatever, who are bilingual. It's not that hard.",
            "Most of us are led to believe that there's something much bigger than ourselves out there, something we can barely wrap our heads around. We're often sent to places like Sunday school or Temple to learn about it, or we search within for answers on our own. Some people just go along with the religions their parents taught them, while others totally reject the idea that there's anything more to life than what they can see and touch. We might adopt one set of values, only to later switch to another. Wherever we go, we're trying to figure out who we are and what we believe through our own special ways of looking at spirituality. We're on a quest to find the light in the dark and guide ourselves out of the shadows and into the sunlight.\n\nMy dad told me that cardinals are his favorite bird when I asked him, and we sat on our porch listening to the rain pound against the tin roof. The gutters were overflowing, drowning the plants along the porch edge. He stared out at the rain, lost in thought, his eyes half searching, half remembering. He'd lost a lot of weight over the past few months, and his clothes hung loose on his body. His hair was thinning out, too. He didn't want to talk about how sick he was, and I was too scared to bring it up. If we talked about it, it would make it feel more real. So I just hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my birthday. The chemo and radiation had kept him alive for a few more months, but it was just prolonging the suffering. I couldn't help but wonder, what was the point of it all? I stopped going to church, and at night, I just lay awake, wondering if God was even listening. I knew that if God was real, he'd stopped caring about me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to see my dad die, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the man who created me slip away. I wanted to remember him for who he was, not how he died. And I knew my dad would've wanted it that way too. So I curled up in a ball and waited for the news. Nobody even bothered calling me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is actually an oxymoron, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements, as Ian Watt so astutely points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This style has been met with both praise and criticism, with some dismissing it as lacking depth, while others hail its ability to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). At the time of its creation, Horace Walpole's \"A Gothic Story\" (as he called it) blended old theatrical elements with new, modern ideas to give birth to the Gothic genre. The Gothic style borrowed heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already seen as old-fashioned and unsophisticated compared to the more modern societal and literary advancements of the time. It was this unexpected mix of the old and the new that allowed the Gothic genre to endure and remain fresh to readers even centuries later.\n\nOne of the most significant features of Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry, which was a major part of medieval culture. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole took this concept and adapted it to suit his story, creating a knight-like character that embodied the qualities that were seen as lacking in his own time. Walpole was writing in a tumultuous era, and his work reflects his fears about the state of society. He may have believed that the morality and goodness that were once associated with the Gothic era had been lost in the present, leading him to idealize and romanticize the past. This is evident in the character of Frederic, who is described as a prince, a sufferer, and a gallant knight. His portrayal is a classic example of the chivalric ideals that were prominent in medieval culture, and it sets the stage for the excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The process of moving goods from the customer's order to the final product delivery is called supply chain management. This concept was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver back in 1982. He described it as a series of processes that work together to deliver customer needs efficiently. There are six main components to a well-functioning supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these elements to provide top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst up is production, the foundation of the entire supply chain process. It's where you figure out when, why, where, and how products get made. To succeed, managers need to know what customers want, and they can find that out by studying the market. Once they've got a handle on customer demand, they can decide what products to make, how many, and where to produce them. They've got to choose a production location that'll meet customer needs for both volume and quality. Next, they focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment to keep things running smoothly.\n\nGetting production right is huge – every detail matters. If you mess up, it can cost a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, my past experience working at Wal-Mart and Target taught me that having clear processes in place is key. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, every step should be outlined to avoid confusion and miscommunication.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves making strategic decisions about a company's capabilities and partnerships. This might involve deciding which production divisions to use for a single product or outsourcing certain tasks to other companies. The goal is to create velocity – delivering quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "It's this sign I saw that really caught my attention: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". I was walking down the street and Ellen Page from that movie Juno was standing there holding a weird sign with Sharpie writing on it. Burma is this country in Southeast Asia where a super strict government took over in 1962 and hasn't really changed since. There was this huge protest in 2007, it was called the Saffron Revolution, because they wore these bright orange robes, and it was the first time people had protested in like a decade. But things escalated quickly and the government started getting really violent. They rounded up all the journalists and even killed a Japanese photographer just for being there. The government said like 13 people died, but this army colonel said that's way off and that there were actually thousands.\n\nIt's not like this is new or anything. For as long as we've had civilization, governments have been trying to shut down any dissent and keep everyone in line. Even ancient Roman emperors thought they were chosen by the gods and could control everything. Japanese emperors thought they were gods too, and our current president, I'm pretty sure, has weekly meetings with some dude from the Republic Party, Ted Haggard. There have been some really crazy events like that, like the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989 where students and intellectuals were killed by the government, and the Rwandan genocide in the 90s where the government killed tons of people just because of who they were. And then there's the whole Hitler thing, but that's pretty self explanatory.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his long career and incredible musical abilities. His piano playing might not be super obvious in many of the songs we're looking at, but as a composer, Ellington was amazing at writing complex pieces that let individual band members shine. He'd create the foundation for a soloist to improvise freely, and also write tightly orchestrated parts that made the most of each band member's style. By doing this, Ellington helped bring out the unique tone of the entire orchestra, making each piece its own. He was a master at understanding how the different band members sounded individually and how they worked together, which is why he wrote some of the most groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's innovative sound and techniques, using Creole Love Call as an example of how he used voice like a jazz instrument throughout his career. This was basically an early experiment with using vocal textures and colors without worrying about lyrics. It also shows Ellington's skill at complementing the style of his soloists, which is something he did really well his whole career. This slow, bluesy twelve-bar piece is a great example - it's got six different sections, each one showcasing the band's different sounds:\n\nThe first chorus is a call-and-response thing with voice and reeds, where the voice starts off smooth and gets rougher towards the end. The second chorus has a muted trumpet solo that adds some extra flavor to the basic melody. The third chorus is a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a simple piano phrase. The fourth chorus is like a big echo of the first one, with the brass and reed sections trading calls and responses. The fifth chorus is the climax, with the reeds taking over the call-and-response and the brass and rhythm sections adding some syncopated rhythms. And the sixth chorus is like the first one, but this time the voice gets all growly and does some instrumental-style soloing.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color to his music is just one example of the cool stuff he did. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his tight orchestration skills with his ear for tone, using a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich sound. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), he made great use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "There was this huge emptiness inside her that she just couldn't shake off. It was a feeling she's had ever since she was 14 and still lingered on at 17. It started as a craving for something, but she had no idea what. She figured out that it wasn't just about things, but about people, specifically - but no one had ever caught her eye. Some guys had tried to get her attention, but every attempt just felt forced. She often found herself wondering what could be the reason behind this crazy desire. Over the years, she'd come up with some theories, but none of them really made sense to her. So, she just kept on living, always questioning her feelings.\n\nAt home, everything was usually chill. She had pretty cool parents who hardly ever argued. When they did, it was usually about her wanting to be her own person. That's because she was super outgoing and fun, like the complete opposite of her calm parents. Today, though, was a different story. As she was looking for some inspiration, she heard a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen and her mom's voice. She rushed in to find her mom on the ground, looking like she was in a lot of pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she frantically asked as she ran to her side and put a hand on her to help. Her mom said \"Ow... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital\" in a really short breath. She could tell her mom was in a lot of pain, so she helped her get off the ground and into the car.\n\nThe hospital had that weird smell of disinfectant and illness, but she was too worried about her mom to feel scared. She quickly grabbed a wheelchair and rushed in to get help. A bunch of worried faces showed up, but her mind was just on her mom. They got her mom onto a bed and took her to see a doctor. Her daughter was left to sit and stress.\n\nApparently, her mom fell off a step stool while trying to get a vase from a super high cabinet. That's how she ended up in the hospital.",
            "This study aimed to figure out if sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), which can be measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", would help lower the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is an adjusted version of the Med diet that's loaded with more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less saturated fat and animal products. It also allows for some booze.\n\nWe already knew from prior studies that eating the Med diet was linked to lower heart disease risk and death, but those studies didn't focus on stroke alone. This study looked at 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who were part of a huge study of female nurses in the US. The researchers tracked their eating habits over 20 years using special questionnaires. About 95% of the women stuck with the study the whole time, and the questionnaires were double-checked to make sure they were accurate.\n\nThe researchers found out what happened to the women over the years by looking at their medical records, death certificates, and hospital info. They even made some educated guesses when they couldn't find the records. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like weight, smoking, exercise, and whether the women took aspirin or vitamins.\n\nTo get a better idea of the women's eating habits over time, the researchers added up their aMed scores from six different questionnaires. Then they adjusted for things that could mess up the results, like age, smoking, and weight. They used a special method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how the aMed diet score affected the women's risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study showed that women who ate the Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Over 20 years, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 heart disease deaths. Women with the highest aMed scores were 29% less likely to get heart disease or stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "It's been over a decade since the US hit rock bottom in 2007, and the aftermath of the financial crisis is still causing waves. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market tanked, and some of America's biggest corporations were left to pick up the pieces. So the question on everyone's mind is: how did this mess happen in the first place? In a nutshell, it all came down to some pretty shady and clueless decision-making by politicians who basically strong-armed banks into giving out sub-prime loans to people who couldn't afford them. At the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being pushed to buy up these dodgy mortgages and package them into some crazy financial instruments that nobody really understood. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were left high and dry and had no choice but to pass the buck to all the other financial institutions they'd sold these toxic assets to.\n\nIt all started brewing back in the Clinton era, when the President was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to boost his popularity, so he relaxed some of the lending rules, which ended up setting the stage for the sub-prime disaster to come. Steve Holmes from the New York Times was onto it back in 1999, warning that Fannie Mae was taking on too much risk by pushing mortgage loans to low-income folks and that it might all come crashing down in an economic downturn. And boy, was he right.\n\nThe economy was like a house of cards, with all these fancy new mortgage types - adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations - that just made things worse. It was like a game of financial Jenga, where everyone was over-leveraging themselves in the housing market, and when the bubble burst, it was game over. The top five investment banks were stuck with a whopping $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which was basically a third of the US GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers went under, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to sell out to become commercial banks with tighter regulations. Fannie and Freddie were in even worse shape, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and the government had to step in to take control in 2008.",
            "But then there's that infamous part of your story, the expositional stretch where you're supposed to flex your writing muscles, but end up putting everyone to sleep instead.  You know, the spot where your readers are either nodding off or frantically hitting the \"Back\" button, cursing your name in the process.  Dr. Merlin sometimes finds herself yelling at her monitor when she gets stuck in this rut, and it's not even the good kind of yelling.\n\nExposition isn't exactly your BFF.\n\nOf course, you probably already know the \"Show, don't tell\" mantra, but Dr. Merlin still manages to get herself stuck in long, meandering passages where nothing much happens – or worse, too much happens.  It's like that pesky devil on your shoulder, urging you to get all the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the other devil telling you to spill every single juicy detail about each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially just telling the audience what's going on in simple, straightforward language.  It's like the movie version, where one character lays it all out for another in a long, rambling monologue (think \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\").  In fiction, you're the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example.  You're reading a story and you're hit with a barrage of info about the heroine: she met her beloved at such-and-such a place, they got hitched in a fancy wedding, and her hubby got whacked right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect that whole sequence to take up two whole pages, with the couple only getting a couple of lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing how much he loved the heroine through his words and actions.  You'd also want to see how much her life changed and improved with him around – especially if the story later reveals that's exactly what happened.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and understand the heroine's feelings, making you more invested in her story as a whole.\n\nIn short, you'd want some substance to go along with the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that extra oomph.  It can be tempting to rush through certain parts, but resist the urge.  Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, works the graveyard shift at a gas station, has been married twice, doesn't have kids, and dreams of owning the gas station one day – all while secretly craving Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched the news from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first thing that caught my attention was a live report from NBC 4 in the morning. They had a story about a guy in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife (they didn't mention her name, but that's not the point). The dude looked pretty sinister in his mug shot - I could tell it was evil written all over his face. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still developing, which I thought was just right. They mentioned that he'd stabbed her multiple times and was under arrest, but that was about it.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting that happened in the Sharon Woods area - some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot and was in pretty bad shape. There were no suspects or arrests yet, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was real short, and I'm guessing it was because the victim was a minority and the neighborhood was a minority one too. I've noticed before that the media doesn't give the same attention to crimes involving minorities as they do to crimes involving white people. For example, if a white kid goes missing, the media is all over it, but if a minority person is a victim, it's like it barely makes the news.\n\nThey also had a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They had some details about where it might have happened and what kind of bullet was used - a .22 caliber from a rifle, I think. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that could lead to the shooter's arrest.\n\nNext up was a story about the weather forecast for the weekend, which sounded pretty typical for Columbus - rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with highs in the mid to low eighties. They made it clear that this was just a teaser to keep us watching, so we'd stick around.\n\nThey also had a report on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They said the perpetrator was a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. What struck me was how much they emphasized his race and how dark he was - it seemed a bit excessive, if you ask me.\n\nThe last story I remember was about Rene Rodriguez, a guy who'd been convicted of being a big-time marijuana dealer from Texas. He'd been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute weed to Ohio from Texas. I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve by saying \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" - maybe they thought it sounded harsher or something. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's something unbreakable between brothers – a connection that can't be broken or undone. This bond is made up of tons of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty – to name just a few. Brothers know each other in a way that nobody else does, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. In tough times, this bond really shows its true colors, whether it's good or bad. But with these emotions comes a price. Part of understanding this bond is dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you can stare a brother in the face and see your own reflection staring back, you see yourself as you really are, not as others see you. It's in their actions and the results of those actions that you find out who they really are. In the classic novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this idea, and all the crazy emotions that come with it. The two boys go on a wild adventure through a super vivid landscape, but it all ends in disaster. A huge mix of bitter disappointment and intense pride comes to a head, and only one brother makes it out alive. The author conveys this theme through the characters' actions, especially the main guy, Doodle, and their interactions with each other. The narrator also plays a key role by showing us how the protagonist feels about the world and how that affects his decisions.\n\nFor the protagonist, it all comes down to one main emotion: pride. From the very beginning, when he and his little brother Doodle first go on an adventure, to their final, disastrous trip, he's always feeling resentful towards Doodle. He wanted a brother who could keep up with him and learn all the cool stuff he knew, like holding his breath and climbing trees. He wanted someone to share his fun with, like racing to the top of a big pine tree and perching in the branches. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, so it was pretty unlikely he'd ever be able to do any of those things. The protagonist's dreams were crushed when that reality hit him. He even had thoughts of getting rid of Doodle, which is pretty messed up. But when Doodle smiles at him, all his anger melts away and he feels a surge of love. This shows that his anger wasn't as strong as he thought. Deep down, he's got a soft spot for his little bro.",
            "The brain is a super cool, super complicated machine that processes info all the time. As technology got way more advanced, people started using more and more fancy metaphors to describe the brain too. First, they compared it to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now it's like a computer. But, it's super important to keep in mind that these metaphors aren't perfect and can lead to some pretty wacky conclusions.\n\nSo, here's how the brain works: it gets all this sensory info from our eyes, ears, and other stuff, and turns it into electrical signals. Then, the brain starts messing with this info over and over in different ways. There are two main kinds of processing: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, your brain puts together tiny pieces of info like color and shape to figure out that it's a box. But then, your brain also uses what it already knows to help you figure out what you're looking at even faster.\n\nBut, there's another step - the brain decides how important the info is and whether you should be paying attention to it or not. Like, you're walking down the street and you see a bunch of blades of grass, but your brain doesn't make you notice them because they're not super important. But, if someone calls out your name in a crowded room, your brain is all like, \"Hey, I should pay attention to that!\"\n\nNow, for the brain to work, it needs to store info somehow. There are different types of memory, like short-term and long-term, and sensory memory. When we first get info, we need to encode it, which is like translating it into a language the brain can understand. For example, if you see a word, your brain can figure out what it looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means. Then, the brain has to keep that info stored somehow. Scientists think that short-term memory works because it's like a special electrical signal that loops through a bunch of neurons for a little while. Long-term memory, on the other hand, might be stored in the structure of special proteins in the brain.\n\nThere are a bunch of different theories about how the brain stores knowledge, some based on how people remember things, some based on computer science, and some based on brain stuff. One theory is that the brain is like a big network with nodes that represent ideas and concepts, and the nodes are all connected because they're related. For example, if you think of the word \"chair,\" your brain might also think of \"table,\" which might remind you of \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and the effects of the capitalistic system in his dystopian novel Brave New World. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, who dictates their ideology. By looking at the book through the lens of Marxist theory, we can see that Huxley is questioning the growth of these systems. Marxist ideas like homogeny and reification are sprinkled throughout the novel, showing that Huxley is saying that these systems have some major flaws.\n\nCapitalism is also criticized in the novel through the concept of false consciousness. This is where people are kept in the dark about the real relationship between different classes in society, and they're more worried about their own gain. It's like the World Controller has a tight grip on the common folks, making them want to buy, spend, and indulge in stuff. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are basically robots, doing what they're told without any free will of their own. They're conditioned with hypnopædia to be obsessed with consuming and spending. The World Controller is behind all of this, making the lower classes think they're part of the system, when really they're just pawns.\n\nThe idea of hegemony is also used in the novel, where a small group of people are in control of the whole society. The lower classes are completely clueless about this, they're just 'buying into' an ideology that helps keep the system going. The upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, know what's going on, but they just go along with it. But not everyone is like that, some characters like Bernard see through the system, but they're the exception.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are basically non-existent. The characters are pretty shallow, even the main ones, and they don't really have any depth. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and individuality. Love and strong emotions are non-existent, and people just go through the motions. It's all pretty superficial, with guys commenting on girls' looks and girls talking about their sex lives. The fact that everyone's okay with their place in society shows how capitalism is affecting people's lives. They're all just following the rules and doing what they're told, like the proletariat in Marxist theory, who are told they're better than everyone else as long as they keep consuming and obeying.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for like two and a half years now, which is basically four and a half semesters of trying to navigate this campus. For many of us, getting around here can be a major pain. My freshman year, I was stuck in East Halls dorm, which is basically as far east as you can go without hitting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Going to classes in places like the Willard building, which is literally in the middle of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when it's all gross outside. I talked to an alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, East Halls was basically its own separate entity from the rest of the school. There used to be this huge empty space between it and the rest of campus, but now it's all been filled in with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder and harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? On a college campus, it's gotta be the bicycle. But, let's be real, having a bike isn't enough - students need to actually ride them, and the campus needs to be set up to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend who just got back into biking after a few years off, and he was saying how he had no idea why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" he said. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for your body, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and get 30 miles or more out of it - all while getting some exercise. I now live off campus, which is basically as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I've got class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. Riding a bike cuts that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always the easiest road to travel on, bike or no bike. I've gotta say, walking has its pros, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up way too much of my time. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's just more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.

The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I'm planning on pursuing a degree in social work with the ultimate goal of working for the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can help kids who've been mistreated or neglected and support families in need. Some values that'll guide me in this career path are service, respect, and being committed to improving relationships between people and myself. I genuinely believe that these values aren't just crucial for social workers, but also for me as a person.\n\nGrowing up, I've always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure which path to take. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed a lot of people running away from their problems and some using less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. I wanted to make a change, so I decided to major in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still unsure of my future. One summer, I met a sixteen-year-old kid who had come to my friend's place to escape his abusive home life. The next day, he called the cops, so I went to his house to see if I could help. I talked to the police and explained my concerns, telling them about my degree in Psychology. They asked me to talk to the parents, and when I did, they seemed pretty nervous and made excuses for their son's behavior. That experience made me realize that I really want to work in social work, helping families like that one.\n\nAnother important value for social work is social justice. We claim that everyone's an individual, but in reality, we're all about following the crowd. If we mourn people who are different, then why do we try to fit in? I'm all about being myself and not limiting myself to what others think is normal. I've always stood up for what I believe in – like when I colored my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that express me, got my ears pierced, joined the GSBA, and spoke out against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it. I believe in social justice, and I'll keep fighting for it.",
            "This paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on genetic information passed down through heredity and medical factors affecting health, while the sociocultural model examines environmental connections and their effects on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. Our review explores these models and digs into the research chosen to better understand and explain them. A critique of the research and its findings highlights their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be classified as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder linked to another mental health issue, or a sleep disorder stemming from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders tied to another mental disorder are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia involves difficulties maintaining adequate or quality sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness lasting at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. The sociocultural implications of these disorders are vast, as they can significantly impact daily life, including work, education, and routine tasks.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited factors, and physical aspects of sleep disorders. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. When the GABAA receptor is activated, it promotes sleep, while inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be applied to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. An issue or absence with this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. The sociocultural significance of this study lies in the potential genetic inheritance of the receptor, which could naturally regulate sleep and disrupt it if altered. This can have far-reaching consequences for daily life, including school, work, and mundane tasks that require focus.",
            "This paper explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects how the brain processes sound. First, we'll define CAPD and explain what it means for people who have it. Then, we'll discuss the signs that point to a diagnosis of CAPD, known as \"red flags\". Lastly, we'll talk about ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can help a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD is a disorder where the brain doesn't work properly when it comes to processing sound. It's not about being deaf or hearing impaired, but about the brain not being able to separate sounds or filter out background noise like it should. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain has trouble translating what they hear into something that makes sense.\n\nThe idea of CAPD has been around since the 1950s, when researchers started studying kids with communication problems. In 1954, a team in Italy was already developing tests for these kids, and by 1961, a scientist named Kimura came up with a way to understand how the brain processes multiple sounds at once. A big conference in 1977 got everyone talking about CAPD and sparked more research.\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble in different areas, like not being able to tell where sounds are coming from or hearing two sounds at the same time. They might have trouble recognizing patterns, like when someone's voice changes or when sounds get mixed up. They might even have trouble figuring out the order of sounds. Other issues include trouble with understanding sarcasm, getting stuck on one sound while another sound is playing, or making sense of sound clues.\n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, doctors use a mix of observing how they behave and testing their hearing skills. This can involve questionnaires, watching how they respond to different sounds, and more in-depth tests that record how the ear responds to sound. Unfortunately, there's no one test that works perfectly for everyone, and there's no known cause for CAPD. Some tests give people a bunch of sounds at once and ask them to pick out certain ones, while others use special equipment to see how the ear responds to sound signals.",
            "It seems like the play Twelfth Night says that using disguises can be super helpful in keeping a secret for a long time, but in the end, you're gonna have to give it up or risk losing yourself in the process. The thing is, it's really hard to stop deceiving people without hurting those around you. Some might not even care that you lied, but others can get pretty mad when they find out. So, it's like, you have to choose between keeping your own identity or keeping your friends and family on your side.  In Twelfth Night, the whole thing with disguising yourself as the opposite gender gets even more complicated because it brings up a lot of other questions. For example, why do people feel like they need to change who they really are just to fit in? In Viola's case, she's just trying to protect herself from bad stuff, so she pretends to be a guy. And it works at first, but it also cuts her off from the people who could help her.\n\nAs Viola is trying to avoid getting hurt, she becomes so good at pretending that Olivia starts to think she's actually a guy named Sebastian, and falls in love with her. Viola's also dealing with some weird feelings for Orsino, who's also into her, but thinks she's a boy. I guess this might seem progressive, but it's kinda like Twelfth Night is saying that deception can help people figure out their real feelings. Like, maybe Olivia and Orsino are hiding some stuff about themselves that Viola/Cesario makes them face. For instance, is Olivia into Cesario because he's a guy, or is she actually into girls in secret? I don't think it's the second one, because Olivia's character seems to be making fun of people who judge others based on looks. We can tell because Olivia goes from having a crush on Cesario to thinking of him as her brother in, like, two seconds.",
            "People have noticed that German colonial rule was pretty brutal, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocides in German South West Africa. But let's be real, it's hard to sum up an entire colonial empire with just a few words. German colonial rule was super varied, both in terms of its policies and how it was run, and it covered a huge amount of different geography. When it comes to education, the German colonies were all over the place, too. When the British took over German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a bunch of super smart and literate Africans. German eduction efforts in places like Kamerun and other colonies even got some good reviews from people writing back then. \n\nBut South West Africa (now Namibia) was a different story altogether. Unlike in East Africa, where the government was all about setting up schools and educating the locals, in South West Africa, the job of educating the natives was pretty much left to missionary groups that didn't have much support from the government. That being said, the government did invest a lot in educating Europeans in the colony and even supported missionary schools more. These educational policies had some long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule was over. Meanwhile, other German colonies had a bunch of literate and educated Africans, but in South West Africa, the majority of the population was basically untouched and illiterate. There were a bunch of social, economic, and political factors that contributed to this different experience. This paper is trying to explore those factors and dive deeper into how settlers and colonial officials felt about native Africans.\n\nThere's a whole lot of research on education in the German colonial empire, but most of it is in German and from the early 20th century. These early studies mostly focused on describing the educational systems in the colonies. Later, more English-language studies came out that compared education in the different German colonies and got into the nitty-gritty details. These studies showed just how different the educational systems were in each colony. The most important study on this topic is probably Cohen's look at education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compared the two colonies and figured out what made their educational systems so different. He thinks it's because South West Africa had a big settler population, which made their education system unique.\n\nCompared to the other colonies, South West Africa had a pretty mild climate, except for all the desert. This made it a more comfortable place for Europeans to live, which is why there were almost 15,000 of them there by 1913. In contrast, only 5,336 settlers lived in the next biggest colony, East Africa.",
            "There are so many genres of popular music now that it's a real challenge to make a definitive list. It gets even worse because even the main genres like rock, country, and jazz have tons of sub-genres within them. Heavy Metal, which started about 40 years ago, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past four decades. It's diverse because it can express a wide range of emotions, mostly on the darker side. And when people first started messing around with it, they realized just how flexible it was and started creating their own sub-genres, which just kept branching out even more. Today it's tough to figure out what heavy metal even is because there are so many different niches, and it's incorporated ideas from other genres. To understand heavy metal today, you have to understand what it's all about and why it's a movement and not just a genre.\n\nHeavy metal is basically a movement all about darkness. It's like the ultimate \"more-is-better\" thing – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more showmanship. And it's not just about raw emotion; the musicians in metal bands know their stuff and it shows in their music. Another cool thing about heavy metal is that it's heavily influenced by psychedelic substances. The psychedelic scene back in the 70s was a wild time and it led to some crazy, trippy music. People used the drugs as a way to get their creativity flowing, and a lot of those songs reflect the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Later metal bands took some of that dark, intense vibe from the Romantic Era and ran with it. You can see it in the lyrics of songs like Helter Skelter, which is actually considered one of the first heavy metal songs ever. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier side, and the Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy and intense. They put it on The White Album, and now it's a classic example of the darker side of music.",
            "I was reading about this dude Henri Rousseau and how he was making his own dreams come true - literally and figuratively - back in the day. His painting, \"The Dream\" from 1910, isn't just about some chick in awe of this fantastical land she's visiting in her dreams, it's also about Rousseau's own hopes and aspirations as an artist. He started off wanting people to recognize him, accept him, and give him props as a painter, but he was stuck in a weird internal struggle. See, he wanted to either play by the rules and do what other artists were doing so he'd get noticed by the art world crowd, or just be himself and forge his own path. \"The Dream\" is like the ultimate representation of this internal conflict that Rousseau faced his whole career.\n\nTo really get what's going on with this painting, you gotta know a bit about Rousseau's life. He was born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, and his dad was this tinsmith who had a pretty good life. Rousseau didn't get any formal art training; instead, he worked for the town as a toll service guy until he was 40. He got called a \"customs inspector,\" but that's not exactly what he did. After losing his wife and eight kids, he turned to painting to escape his pain and start fresh. Unlike other artists of his time who painted all sappy and romantic about peasants, Rousseau was a true folk painter who just wanted to live the average guy's life.\n\nIt's not surprising that Rousseau wanted to be accepted by the art world, given that he was basically a self-taught painter who started late in life, and there were all these other talented artists around at the same time. He didn't get any real recognition until around the same time that Matisse was building his rep as an artist. Jan Gordon, the author of Modern French Painters, said that while Matisse was trying to avoid painting something boring, Rousseau was all about painting something so normal that people would think he was a \"real\" artist. It's pretty deep, man.",
            "A lot of deep thinkers have said that ethics and aesthetics are super connected, like two peas in a pod. I think there's a reason for this. John Keats said it best in that one poem, \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we know comes from learning or experiencing stuff, but it seems like we actually get ethics and aesthetics without needing a teacher to tell us about it. Both ethics and aesthetics are about describing, not dictating - like trying to figure out why a work of art is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than making up a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. \n\nTo get to the point, you can't fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful just by talking about it. Trying to analyze the Mona Lisa might be all about stuff like the foreground and background, but those things don't really tell you why it's so amazing. When people talk about their favorite art or literature, they often say something like, \"There's just something about it,\" and then give a more complicated explanation. I think that's because art and morals can't be reduced to just describing their qualities. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\" and I think that's true for ethics too. No matter how much you describe the properties of a work of literature, there's still something left that's hard to put into words. I think that's the same with ethics - it's like this mysterious, otherworldly thing that we can experience but can't fully explain. \n\nI think that's why ethics and art are so closely connected - we experience them both at this deep, unexplainable level. This is especially true for literature, as McKean said, \"What makes literature unique is its moral quality. It's like it's a part of life itself.\" We all experience life with values, and that's why literature is important to us because of the values we find there.",
            "Germany's strong presence in the world today is really something to be reckoned with. It's a country with its own unique culture that stretches from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel, and from Köln on the Rhine River through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It shouldn't be a surprise that Germany's culture has roots from all over since it's made up of different tribes and sources. \n\nThe land where the Germans originated is called Germania, but its name's meaning is a total mystery. Some experts think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as the Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. However, others believe it might have come from the Gauls themselves, who used the word 'Germanus' to describe their neighbors. Julius Caesar first used this word to distinguish between the Gauls he conquered and the Germanic tribes he fought against. In his book about the Gallic Wars, he wrote that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine, constantly battling the Gauls in almost daily fights. But where exactly the name 'German' came from is still a debate - some say it's from the spear they used in battle, the 'ger', while others think it might be from the Old Irish word 'garim', which means 'to shout', implying the Germans were pretty loud. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the origins of the Germans in his book 'De Origine et situ Germanorum' back in AD 98. He described the Germans as being aboriginal, not mixed with other races, and living on ships when they wanted to leave their homeland. He wondered why anyone would leave a place like Rome for a wild and harsh land like Germania, unless it was their home. So, the Romans didn't exactly conquer Germania, but they did send out their soldiers to trade and fight there. The Germanic tribes started appearing in the early first century and lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods and serving in the Roman army.",

My thoughts were zipping in and out so fast I couldn't really catch any of them - it was like my brain was just going through the motions. It was actually kind of weird, like I didn't really have any real thoughts of my own, just a bunch of stuff happening in my head.\n\nRecently I picked up this art book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain after some advice from an artist I was working with. I've wanted to draw since I was like six and this book teaches you all the basics, from what a pencil even is to how the brain works when you're looking at lines. One trick it shows you is to draw a square around whatever you're looking at to make it simpler. It's like turning a super complicated picture into something you can actually handle.\n\nAt the time, I was staring at this bowl of fruit and just couldn't get my brain to think about it in a more simple way. I was so overwhelmed that I just stood there staring in awe. I guess you could say the great artists like Picasso went through different phases - blue, green, all that stuff. If I wanted to be a \"real\" artist, I guess this was the start of my picture, my story, my thing - which I thought of as Work in Brown.\n\nI picked up my pencil and started to draw, my hand moving over the paper, but then I kind of snapped out of it and smacked my hand on the toilet handle. I was trying to, uh, take care of some business, but this brown package was stuck and not going anywhere. I had to use some pretty creative language to describe it. Finally, after a few more attempts, I managed to get it to move. I was still in a pretty calm state, so I just stood there for a second, then I started wrapping the toilet paper around my hand like a mummy. I know it sounds weird, but I was just in this really peaceful, introspective place. I stood up, bent down, and then my hand went into the toilet like I was putting a big turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving...",
            "I went to the dentist and got five teeth pulled so I can get braces by Thursday, but it turns out I don't have any teeth left for them to glue on! The laughing gas really got to me, and I started seeing double everywhere. It was just like that episode of The Simpsons where Lisa gets braces and laughing gas – I kept feeling like I was in the scene where she dreams about The Beatles. The whole time I was numb, I kept hearing my inner voice singing 'I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons! I'm on the Simpsons!' over and over again. I don't really remember much from the procedure except for the weird needle dream and the last two teeth getting pulled. When I got home, I felt like a chipmunk – I hate being numb, especially when I lost feeling in most of my face, including my ear. Now that's all over, and I'm looking forward to some Tofutti ice cream and sweet potato mush – AlexD suggested I try liquid prime ribs, but I'm not so sure. I have to go through the pain again for braces on Thursday, and I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nI tried to dye my hair blue today in art class, but it didn't work on my dark hair, so I have to highlight it first. I'm hoping to get it done before the Styx concert tomorrow. I used a Sharpie to dye a strand of my hair blue, and surprisingly, it turned out really well, but it dried out my hair a bit. I'm not sure if it'll wash out, so I might have to dye it a lighter blue color. My advisor, Brian, is a Gunker almost, just like Sporko, and he's really knowledgeable about hair dye. I drew him as a rock star on Wednesday, and he's going to help me with my hair tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow is the last day of portrait camp, but I'll be back for the landscape class soon – maybe the 14th or 17th. I'll need all the luck I can get for my hair and the concert.\n\nNow, let's talk about something serious – teenagers are dying behind the wheel. It's a deadly trend that's hard to ignore. Several factors contribute to this problem, including the fact that the teen brain isn't ready for the hazards of driving. Inexperience is another major factor – it not only causes fatal accidents but also increases the risk of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road. And if teens are driving with their peers, which they often do, the risks are even higher. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents.\n\nStates like California have tried to increase safety by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers. But these measures are just stopgap solutions – the real issue is that young drivers are, by all statistical markers, not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that 18 is still too young for a regular driver's license, and his research suggests that people under 19 or 20 tend to take risks for the thrill of it. It makes sense to delay driving until this tendency has leveled out. If we keep issuing licenses to young teens, we'll keep seeing deadly accidents and the death toll will rise to staggering proportions. By 2010, the Baby-Boomer's kids will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation to address this issue would be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes, but no one under 18 could get a driver's license. A provisional permit could still be issued before the full license, and a certain number of practical training hours would be required. The number of hours could be based on what most states currently require – like California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country. It's not a new idea, but it's one that's long overdue.",
            "So, I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of old Edison films and decided to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. These movies are pretty cool because they use some seriously creative editing to create illusions. I mainly focused on studying the poetry behind most of these trick films and figuring out how some of the later ones evolved from the early ones. Generally, trick films from around that time stick to a pretty basic structure – they're set-bound, stuck within a frontal proscenium, don't feature any camera movement, and use long and medium shots. However, some films from the early 1900s started experimenting and breaking these rules by introducing new elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that all these trick films have in common is that they're filmed within a set on a frontal proscenium stage. The camera never moves from its spot, which is pretty common for early films and was actually inspired by theatre and vaudeville/magic acts. But one of the downsides of using a stage is that actors in trick films can only move left or right, they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Take the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), for example, where the actors come in from the right side and just walk back and forth along the horizontal axis, even when they're out of frame, the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nThe way these films are composed also means that shots are mostly long shots and occasionally medium shots, but never close-ups. This is similar to how theatre and vaudeville work, where you see the whole performance at once. Since actors never move towards the camera, you never get close-ups. Most early trick films also follow a pretty simple rule: one conceptual shot is equal to one film, which is why most of them are pretty short – around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It's not exactly a compelling narrative either, mostly just short tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single shot might actually be several physical shots joined together to create an illusion, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a close look reveals where the physical shot with Mary's fake severed head starts, even though the whole film is one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "So, I'm telling you about John Taylor of Caroline, this guy who was a total die-hard Republican. He was all about his farm work, but that and his short stint in politics made him a legend for speaking his mind on personal freedoms and government stuff. His big thing was preserving and promoting agriculture, and that influenced how he thought about pretty much everything, including the government and the law. He was all about keeping it real and not letting the government get too big or powerful.\n\nTaylor thought the US had a chance to create the ultimate system since we didn't have any old traditions holding us back. He was all about the natural rights of people and how they're all connected - if one gets taken away, they all do, and it makes the rest less valuable. He said that in a normal state of nature, the strong and mean guys are the ones who get ahead, but that's not how it should be in a civilized society.\n\nTo make a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should be made up of good and bad stuff, like how people are. He was super strict about his idea of good and evil and said that as long as the government is run by humans, it'll have its own set of good and bad qualities. He thought good principles were about protecting private property, helping out farmers, and keeping capitalism in check. He believed a government with good principles would work fairly no matter who's in charge, even if they're just trying to do what's good for themselves. But he also thought that self-interest is just a normal part of being human, and it's only bad when it hurts others. He said a good government needs to keep an eye on people's natural bad tendencies and make sure they don't get out of control.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of other Republicans back then, wanted the government to interpret the Constitution really strictly. He wanted a super small government with only the powers that the Constitution says it has. He knew that a big government is expensive and might turn into a dictatorship, but he also thought that just following the letter of the law without thinking about the people who wrote it could be bad too. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was like a blueprint for the US, because it says we're a bunch of independent states, not just one country.",
            "Going back to the graph, it's pretty clear that the number of commuter log submissions dropped dramatically in the third month of the project. It was pretty discouraging, and I'm still trying to figure out why that happened. Winter had just hit the New England campus, which probably explains some of the decline in people biking or walking to school. At the same time, it was the end of the fall semester, and people were super busy finishing up their schoolwork and dealing with grades. Filling out the commuter log just slipped their minds, I guess. Plus, December is the start of the holiday season, and everyone was either busy or on winter break, so it's no wonder that the log submissions were way down. Classes didn't resume until late January, which maybe explains the low numbers for that month too. But the low numbers in February still don't make sense. We were worried that people's initial enthusiasm for the project would wear off over time, and that's exactly what happened. We tried to combat this with Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did end up boosting log submissions for that month. So, we faced a couple of major challenges: keeping people engaged when they naturally lose interest, and dealing with the holiday and semester breaks that come with higher ed. \n\nAnother big problem is that people love driving their cars because it's so convenient and independent, which is just part of our culture. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we need to offer some serious incentives. We gave out gift cards to local places, but it would have been cool to see how bigger prizes, like a free bike or hybrid car, would have affected participation. That might have helped us avoid that dip in engagement. The prizes we offered didn't change over time, and while the gift cards were nice at first, announcing bigger prizes in December and January might have made a huge difference. We might have seen way higher participation rates instead of declining ones.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a super flexible security that's like a stock, but tracks an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets like an index fund.  You get the benefits of owning a single stock, like selling short and buying on margin, and the diversification of an index fund, but with lower expense ratios than the average mutual fund.  The downside is that you'll have to pay a commission on trades, just like with stocks.  On the plus side, there are tons of ETFs to choose from.  But, it's always smart to double-check the benefits, like diversification, to make sure they're really there and how much they're worth.  For this project, we're taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF is as good as owning a diversified portfolio of those 10 stocks.  We also want to know if there's a better way to mix and match those stocks for a better return and lower risk.\n\nTo make things simpler, we're only looking at the top 10 holdings that make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  These are the stocks that are included below.  To figure out how well these 10 stocks represent the entire ETF, we're calculating their Beta and Return as if they were the only stocks in the portfolio.  We're using the current percentages of the holdings to do this.  The chart below shows the results.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings would have a return that's 6.11% higher than the ETF, which is a 16% increase.  It also shows that the Beta of the top 10 holdings is .12 lower than the ETF's Beta.  So far, it looks like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could be a better bet, but we need to make sure the difference is real and not just a fluke.  To do this, we're looking at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and comparing it to the ETF's standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's favorite poems is Dream-Land. In Dream-Land, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\", which he likely got from Virgil. But there's a catch - Virgil might not have been the first person to use this term. It's also possible that Poe borrowed it from another source, especially since he was super into German authors. \n\nThis is significant because it shows just how familiar Poe was with Goethe's writing. Some people, like Karl J. Arndt, think that Poe was even copying Goethe's style. Arndt wrote about this in his book Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon. \n\nYou can find a whole poem called \"The King of Thulé\" in the second part of Goethe's famous poetic drama Faust. It's about a king who's really upset after his wife dies and gives him a special goblet. He starts drinking a lot and crying, and eventually decides it's time to die. He gives away all his stuff except the goblet and then jumps off a cliff. Sounds pretty similar to the King of Thule in Dream-Land, right? Maybe it's like a darker version of Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nFaust was also made into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thulé in The Pit and the Pendulum. Poe actually mentions Thulé twice in his writing - once in The Pit and the Pendulum and twice in Dream-Land. You could say that \"The King of Thule\" and Dream-Land are like two poems that go together. In Dream-Land, the speaker talks about how dark and lonely Thulé is, and how he's haunted by dead friends. It's like he's stepping into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a huge deal, and Poe must have known about him because of his respect for Tennyson. Poe said that he admired Tennyson, and Tennyson was really into Goethe. Poe would have seen Goethe's work in all the reproductions that were happening after the original publication. So, it's no surprise that Poe was influenced by Goethe's style.",
            "I've been wondering if a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could get punitive damages under California law if the store manager was really careless. He was told about the spill twice, but he didn't clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. A judge might not dismiss the customer's claim right away. To get punitive damages, the customer will have to show that the manager was super reckless and knew how bad his actions would be. The customer can argue that the manager should have known this because a bunch of other customers had slipped and fallen at the store before, and he still didn't do anything about it. Even though this isn't the strongest reason, it's a pretty good one, considering that six people had slipped and fallen in the store that year, and the manager still didn't take care of the problem.\n\nIt turns out that the manager, Paul Martin, was really relaxed about cleaning up the spill. On October 13th, one of his employees, Rich Wayne, told him about it, but Martin said he was on a break and didn't have time for customer complaints. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reminded him an hour later, and he gave the same response. An hour after that, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got really hurt. Before that, five other people had slipped and fallen in the store that year. Now Palmer is suing the store for money to cover her medical bills and some extra money to teach the store a lesson. We're thinking about whether to ask the judge to throw out that part of the lawsuit.\n\nIn California, a customer can get punitive damages if the store did something really bad on purpose or was super reckless and didn't care about the consequences. The law says that if the store didn't mean to hurt the customer, but still did something really bad, it's like they did it on purpose. This can happen if the store knew what they were doing would hurt someone, but they went ahead and did it anyway. A court said that's what happened in a case called Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., where the store was aware of the risks and still didn't do anything to prevent them.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course on Islam at CBC, which got me thinking about how people view the religion.  One thing that really stuck out was the debate over whether Islam is actually a hostile faith - a question that's even more relevant now than back then.  Looking back on what's happened since 9/11, I've seen the media's attitude swing from being super negative to being super tolerant of Islam in the US.  I mean, can you imagine a presidential candidate with a Muslim background like Barack Obama in 2001?  It's crazy.\n\nWhat really got me was reading the Prophet's biography.  From what I knew, I thought Muhammad was all about forcing people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a totally different picture - he's more like a martyr who's humble and misunderstood.  People come to him because they're convinced by his teachings, not because he's forcing them to join.  It's weird, because there are some pretty cool similarities between Jesus and Muhammad's alleged miracles, like the time Muhammad fed a group of people with some mutton and milk.  But it's always bugging me that the writers of the biography seem to be trying to make Muhammad out to be this humble guy who doesn't need to prove anything.  It's like they're trying to take credit for Jesus' life and message by linking it to Muhammad.  \n \nI also have some issues with the way the stories in the biography are presented.  A lot of them are second-hand or third-hand accounts, which just makes me think they're not entirely trustworthy.  It's like they're trying to prove that people converted to Islam of their own free will, but it comes across as kinda suspicious.  What really gets my goat is that they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, godly guy who's humble and wise.  But the historical record says otherwise - and I wonder if Muslims today know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "It appears that Jesus' teachings and the beliefs he held during his lifetime got lost in the shuffle as Christianity continued to evolve after he was gone.  If you look at the history of Christianity in general terms, you can see a pattern where the original teachings have gradually drifted away.  Nowadays, it's more and more clear that people are becoming more open-minded and there's a growing trend of progress.  While traditionalists will resist any change from what they were taught, their numbers might not be enough to sway the masses.  Within Christianity, a deeper understanding of history will grow over the coming years, and people will start to differentiate between the ideas that were added to the religion over time and what Jesus originally intended.  It might take a long time, decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  There will be a major shift in the way Christianity has been progressing.  The trend will reverse itself, moving backward until all that's left is the original stuff that Jesus brought to the world on behalf of God, before other thinkers started making their own claims.  When this shift starts spreading through the US and Europe, a lot of people will begin to worship in the same way they did back in Jesus' time, following his ideas alone.  The church as an institution will still be a major force, but because the theological clock will be turned back, the huge variety in Christianity will start to shrink into more and more uniformity of beliefs and practices.  Instead of seeing lots of differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, people will start to notice more and more similarities.  History is full of great reversals like this - think about how Christians used to be persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but then the empire became a Christian institution, or how our country went from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  A similar big reversal is coming in the Christian world, undoing history to get back to the source, and in the process, undoing the diversity that's developed over time.  A crucial part of this process will be understanding Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than taking them as literal statements.  So, what happened since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking way back into history, we can see that the only thing that existed was Judaism, which is the foundation for the Christian religion.  By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the idea of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already at the core of Judaism.  But even back then, the Jewish population wasn't a single, unified group - they split into different factions, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of regular people.",
            "I think that The Jungle really brings out how selfish and self-centered people are deep down. They only care about themselves and making their own lives awesome, but they never think about anyone below them. This is shown in many ways in The Jungle. The owners and managers of the big factories are a total example of this. All they care about is making their companies huge and powerful. They don't even think about anyone or anything that gets in their way or gets harmed because of their stuff. Upton Sinclair is really good at painting a picture of just how bad the pollution from these factories is in his book. He says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". He's trying to show just how much damage all this pollution is causing. The owners don't care if anyone gets hurt. They don't care about all the smoke coming out of the factories or the gross stuff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also didn't care about their employees at all. They would do anything to make or save a little more money. \"So from the top to bottom the place is just a huge mix of jealousies and hatreds; there's no loyalty or decency anywhere, there's no place where a person counts for anything against a dollar\". They made their employees work super long hours and then would just get rid of loads of people without any notice or help finding a new job. During the time The Jungle is set in, there were hardly any laws to protect workers' safety or well-being. This let the managers and owners do whatever they wanted, making their employees speed up and work in terrible conditions. The people who lived and worked in Packingtown were basically expected to deal with the awful conditions, both on the job and at home. There were no organizations or agencies to help the workers. There were unions, but they often made more money off the poor workers than they helped them. The workers were treated so badly and had no way to escape the system of Packingtown that they were basically treated like slaves. \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "A lot of authors use different techniques in their writing to get a specific emotion or attitude across to their readers. Some of these techniques work way better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of The Great Gatsby, uses a lot of these techniques in his novel. Sometimes, he pairs words together in a way that doesn't usually go together to create a certain vibe about a subject. Other times, he gives a certain meaning to a symbol and then uses it for the same purpose. \n\nOne technique Fitzgerald uses often is building up a meaning for colors and then later using that meaning to remind readers of a particular feeling around an important thing. He does this with colors like gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald starts giving meaning to white and gray and then later uses that meaning to create a certain feeling about something.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald gives to white and gray is all about uniformity and sameness. He shows this by using these colors a lot at the beginning of the novel. For example, everyone is always wearing white. Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\", and even the settings are described with white and gray: Nick wears \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\". The only time people aren't wearing white is when Nick gives his impression of Gatsby's party. Fitzgerald even defines these colors by using them to describe everyday, unimportant things like buildings, people, and names. \n\nAfter Fitzgerald has built up the meaning of white and gray, he starts using them to show how unimportant or boring something is. He does this by using these colors to describe Daisy, who used to be a bigger character, but now feels more like just a boring addition to the story. Fitzgerald does this by describing Daisy wearing white or gray, like when she's dressed in white in a little white roadster. The readers start to see her as just a part of the uniform, something that Gatsby wants and longs for. He does this again and again to make this point about Daisy being a boring addition. For example, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and she's wearing white again before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is super fertile due to its pleasant, sunny climate. They grow all sorts of yummy stuff like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a huge demand for organic food in the area, with lots of people waiting months to get their hands on it. People also love buying organic eggs and milk. Many of these farms even let you come and explore their operations, hike, or go birdwatching - it's like getting a free mini-vacation. This type of farm can help the landowner get government cash while keeping the land nice and healthy, which is awesome because it lets people visit and learn stuff.\n\nNot only does this type of farming make a bunch of money, but it also brings in all sorts of cool wildlife because they don't use yucky chemicals. However, it's way more work and can be more expensive than regular farming because you have to get rid of pests and weeds the hard way and manually fertilize the soil. You also might lose more crops, and a small farm can't compete with those giant, industrial farms when it comes to efficiency. They also have to do extra stuff like planting special crops to keep the soil healthy and removing invasive species, which costs more time and money.\n\nThis land I chose for this example is in an awesome spot near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's 160 acres of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan is all over the area, and they're still reviewing it. It's home to over a hundred species of plants and animals, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, which are all in danger of disappearing. This land has been home to Native Americans for a super long time and was later used for cattle ranching and selling cordwood in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, so it probably used to be used for grazing and wood production for a while.\n\nI picked a piece of land from a real estate site and looked into government programs to see what a small farmer might be able to do to make farming more affordable and still save the wildlife. I chose an organic farm in the same area as a model of what someone might try to do with this land.",
            "Culture's impact on a negotiation is significant. Culture isn't just what it is, but also what it isn't and what it signifies. It's not a single, unified thing, nor is it the same across the board. General statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are way too broad and pretty simplistic. It's more productive for a negotiator to understand the importance of a culture to the specific negotiation at hand and how that culture's attitude will affect the discussion. When you encounter a foreign culture, you experience it in a way that relates to your own, which leads to comparisons.\n\nGetting to know a foreign culture or mindset can involve studying its history, understanding its biases, or learning about its traditions. Rather than judging or trying to change it, you need to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when negotiating. If you're in a weaker position, showing respect for the other culture and its traditions can really help you break down any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's worth noting that culture isn't just about national or international differences. Companies often have their own unique corporate culture, which can vary greatly from one company to another. For instance, some companies might expect employees to work long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. Look at how different companies in the same country can have distinct corporate cultures, from dress codes to communication styles to hiring practices. Some companies might even have different corporate cultures within the same company, depending on the region or location.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is also key, because it helps you understand the \"why\" behind it. If saving face or maintaining harmony are important in a culture, you can bet that a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company or superior to get ahead in a negotiation. On the other hand, a negotiator from a culture that values a tough bargain won't necessarily settle for a quick agreement. Knowing these generalities beforehand is crucial before sitting down at the negotiating table. However, it's also really helpful to learn something about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation go smoothly.",
            "There's this famous phrase from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" It's actually the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. We're also gonna look at Thomas Aquinas, and since their ideas pretty much support the same concept, we'll assume they're both right about God being the one from the Bible. If their God wasn't from the Bible, it'd be hard to compare their arguments since they're really trying to prove one specific version of God exists. So, we're gonna start by thinking they both believe in the same God.\n\nTo get a feel for their ideas, let's look at St. Anselm's first. Anselm says that we can figure out God by looking inside ourselves. He thinks that since we can't really imagine a world without God, it's proof that God exists in our minds. This idea can get a bit confusing, but basically, Anselm's saying that we can know God just by thinking about what we already know to be true. That's kinda like having faith – it's not about needing proof, it's about trusting what's inside your head. This is a big deal in Christianity because it's about trusting in something that might not be proven.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas took a different approach. He thinks we can prove God exists using logic and facts, no faith needed. This would actually be pretty cool for spreading the word of Christianity because people wouldn't need to believe something just because they're told to – they could believe it because it makes sense. Aquinas came up with five separate arguments to show that God must exist because of the way the world works: change, cause and effect, things that are temporary, levels of perfection, and things working together in harmony. Each one basically says that since we can see how all these things need a creator, we can know God must be that creator without even seeing God.",
            "Sometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would eventually be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, this prince made the choice to leave behind worldly life and achieve enlightenment, which led to the establishment of Buddhism. Over time, the teachings have led to the formation of the most traditional form of Buddhism, which is often referred to as Theravada. As the religion has aged – it's now around 2500 years old – it's undergone a lot of changes. This is clear when looking at countries like Sri Lanka, where the Theravada community has developed unique traditions and celebrations, like the water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is observed by both monks and lay followers, but interestingly, it wasn't something that Buddha himself ever taught about. The differences between past and present can be seen in both the surface-level customs and the core teachings of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its guiding principles over the years, both when influenced by external forces, like those from outside the Buddhist community, and internal ones, like changes within the community itself.\n\nTo make sense of this discussion, it's essential to understand some key concepts that will be used throughout. 'Internal' refers to forces generated by members of the Buddhist community, regardless of whether they're monks or lay followers. 'External' forces come from outside the Buddhist community. A 'hostile' force is one that aims to harm or damage the community, often due to a negative perception of Buddhism. A 'benign' force, on the other hand, doesn't intend to harm or help the community, but may end up doing so as a byproduct.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need to explore the fundamentals of Theravada Buddhism – the core teachings that it's built upon. Buddhists find refuge in the 'triple gem': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the three baskets (Tripitaka) of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas (Buddhist teachings), the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules for living, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the more abstract, metaphysical concepts of Buddhism, such as the idea that there is no permanent soul (Anatta), that life is marked by inherent suffering (Dukkha), and that everything is impermanent (Anicca). Recognizing these concepts is crucial in breaking free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), will cease when one achieves enlightenment. In the Vinaya Pitaka, guidelines for living are outlined. For lay followers, there are five basic principles to follow (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral behavior, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks, on the other hand, must adhere to many more rules. The core of Buddhism, however, is the four noble truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The US and Mexico were at odds for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, due to a longstanding rivalry. This tension was at its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the US defeated Mexico and took control of Texas and the American Southwest (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). Many other conflicts occurred between the two nations, but they eventually cooled off just before World War I. The initial conflict started with disagreements over issues like religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThis situation isn't unique - many neighboring nations have similar rivalries. When countries share a border, their conflicting interests can lead to the formation of opposing stances between them. The US and Mexico aren't the only example of this; other nations with a history of border disputes often have similar issues. David M. Pletcher notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only Latin American nations that have had long-standing diplomatic troubles with the US (1977, p. 41).\n\nOne major point of contention between the US and Mexico was their religious differences, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm points out that Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries, just as they were opposed to fascism and communism in the 20th century (2001, p. 86). Like the ideological struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, this rivalry was based on differing values and interests, but in this case, they stemmed from the US and Mexico's contrasting religious preferences. This distrust was inherited from their colonial rulers, the English and Spanish, making it difficult for the two nations to establish friendly relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during this 57-year period, mostly related to territorial issues, such as border raids and frontier problems. Border bandits and outlaws from American towns were a significant problem until the US and Mexico took military action to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). Schmitt notes that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and eventually ended as the US shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (1974, p. 109-110).",
            "It's been 15 years since I was taken down by a sickness that caught me completely off guard. Back then I was working as a nurse because, as a kid, I didn't have the stability and security I craved. People kept saying things like 'You'll always find work - people will always get sick' so I picked nursing over my true passions, which were science and journalism. Even though I had dreams of being both, it was easier to rely on a steady income. \n\nI'm now 46 and single, broke, and unable to work because of this illness. I've been living off Social Security Disability for 15 years, and to this day, I have nothing that's truly mine. Each day feels like a struggle, an assault on my sense of security, safety, and confidence. Nothing feels secure anymore, but one thing I know for sure - if it weren't for my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. Even when disaster strikes, you don't feel as strong as you thought you'd be.\n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected emergencies, big and small. No matter how prepared you are, some things are just too overwhelming to handle on your own. The U.S. needs to stop putting all its eggs in the government basket, which is crumbling anyway. Instead, I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, to ask for help without hesitation.\n\nThe U.S. Conservatives keep talking about rugged individualism, but the truth is, our ancestors' success in tough times wasn't about going it alone - it was about compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources. The pioneers who trekked across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by themselves.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have a disaster kit stocked with first aid supplies, water purifiers, and emergency essentials. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, and canned goods. If you have the means and resources for a small farm, that's a great idea too. But while you're at it, take the time to know your neighbors - it might just save you in a pinch.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there any rules or limitations that affect the direction of evolutionary change? Even back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that zoologists had barely started to think about describing simple organic shapes using math. Nowadays, it's still pretty much the same. Lately, scientists have tried using math to figure out how mollusks' skeletons grow and change over time. Our research is focused on using math to understand how animals like Prunum change and grow. We're combining math with experiments to learn more about how evolution works.\n\nWe looked at X-ray pictures of Prunum shells to find patterns that we could use to create models of how shells might change over time. We fed this data into a computer program called CerioShell (Stone, 1995) and used it to imagine how shells could be different. These ideas are being combined with other studies to help us understand how big changes happened in this group of animals.\n\nIf you think about a shell as a tube that moves through space over time, it's kind of like a big spiral staircase. The different turns of the shell are called whorls, and they're connected by a line called a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, and the other whorls are called the spire. The pointy top of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles - apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. A way to count the whorls is to look at the shell from the top and draw a line where the first suture starts. Then, we count the whorls from that line, estimating a quarter of a whorl if it's not a whole number.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through space and time as the animal builds its shell. We can track the path of these holes by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the hole. This path can be represented mathematically and graphically. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how it affects the way the shell grows.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant deaths in Indonesia hasn't really changed over the past ten years.  It's weird, because the country is doing pretty well in other areas like water and sanitation, but when it comes to keeping babies and moms safe, they're way behind where they need to be by 2015. I'm gonna get into the reasons later, but basically, it's time to make the whole health system stronger instead of just focusing on individual programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress with getting medical workers at births, with 72% of births meeting this target now. But it's a little misleading because they include midwives who can't do much if something goes wrong, so a lot of moms still die from things like bleeding after delivery. Plus, it's not like they're getting better care for the little kids either - in fact, they're getting worse. We don't have all the info on post-birth care, but it's pretty clear that's another problem area.\n\nC-sections are still way too low, only 4%, and it's even worse in rural areas where it's only 2%. That shows how uneven healthcare is around the country, with mostly rich people getting the good stuff. And to make things worse, there's a huge gap in healthcare access between the poor and the rich - it's like a 27% difference. So, the poor people are basically stuck without access to healthcare because they can't afford it.\n\nNow we have to figure out how to fix this, and the main question is whether to focus on improving specific programs or strengthening the whole health system. It's tempting to do the specific programs because they're more focused, but they also have some major drawbacks. For one thing, it's hard to get funding for other areas when someone's getting a lot of attention for one thing. And with too many programs going on at once, you end up with a bunch of duplicate services and a huge mess of paperwork and supplies.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the high society of the time.  However, two novels that stray from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels feature an element of mystery and a penchant for the bizarre, which is unusual for the period, and this adds depth to the characters; giving insight into their motives and emotions.  \n\nAnd then, a jumble of confusing ideas started racing through his mind.  He was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing loudly; the words they said were still echoing in his ears; and when he suddenly snapped back to reality, he realized he was talking to them.  Then, the sound of gunfire startled him, and he was bombarded by a cacophony of screams and shouts.  Everything around him was a blur, and he felt an overwhelming sense of pain that refused to subside.\n\nThese two novels often use mystery through dreamlike states, though the content and purpose varies in each case.  In Oliver Twist, these strange events often reveal Oliver's innermost thoughts, his fears, and his awareness of the harsh reality around him.  When Oliver is shot in the end, the scene is revisited in chapter 28, and he relives it vividly, as if it were a dream, while desperately trying to find help.  The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as his dire circumstances, which are evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms him, numbing all his senses; he's unaware of the 'unseen force' that's taking him away.  His despair is replayed before him, now constant and linked with fear rather than shock.  With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises as to whose actions led to his misfortune, since it was certainly not his own.  This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, not even his own life, as he fails to even attempt to take control of an event's outcome.  A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin had broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and lose his ability to react.  Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save his own life.\n\n\nThe day passed all too quickly – it was gone before he knew it – and night fell again, long and oppressive in its silence, but brief in its fleeting moments.",
            "I used to work at an after-school program where I helped elementary students with their schoolwork. My specialty was English and reading, but I tried to assist them in whatever subjects they were struggling with. I was asked to work with this kid named Adrian, who was having some serious trouble reading. At first, I thought he was just having a tough time, but it turned out that something weird was going on - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly, but others were way off. I knew he was of Latino descent, but he spoke perfect English, which was really weird. We struggled to figure out what was going on until the day I met his mom. She didn't speak a word of English, only Spanish, and I was barely learning it at the time. We managed to communicate somehow, but it hit me like a ton of bricks when I realized that Adrian knew how to read just fine - he just didn't know the English alphabet. I don't know if that insight really helped him much, but I hope he's doing okay now.\n\nI share that story to highlight the problem of language barriers in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think - even if a kid speaks perfect English, reading can still be super tough. Everyone agrees that this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was pretty simple: one-on-one tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no single answer. Some people swear by the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or a combination of all of the above. The key is to try a bit of everything.\n\nThe dual language system is a great idea - not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. It's been shown that kids in these programs outperform their peers academically. A lot of people are scared that it's a waste of resources, but that's not true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from them. So, how do we make it happen? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But we can definitely have special aides, tutors, or whatever, who are bilingual. It's not that hard.",
            "Most of us are led to believe that there's something much bigger than ourselves out there, something we can barely wrap our heads around. We're often sent to places like Sunday school or Temple to learn about it, or we search within for answers on our own. Some people just go along with the religions their parents taught them, while others totally reject the idea that there's anything more to life than what they can see and touch. We might adopt one set of values, only to later switch to another. Wherever we go, we're trying to figure out who we are and what we believe through our own special ways of looking at spirituality. We're on a quest to find the light in the dark and guide ourselves out of the shadows and into the sunlight.\n\nMy dad told me that cardinals are his favorite bird when I asked him, and we sat on our porch listening to the rain pound against the tin roof. The gutters were overflowing, drowning the plants along the porch edge. He stared out at the rain, lost in thought, his eyes half searching, half remembering. He'd lost a lot of weight over the past few months, and his clothes hung loose on his body. His hair was thinning out, too. He didn't want to talk about how sick he was, and I was too scared to bring it up. If we talked about it, it would make it feel more real. So I just hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my birthday. The chemo and radiation had kept him alive for a few more months, but it was just prolonging the suffering. I couldn't help but wonder, what was the point of it all? I stopped going to church, and at night, I just lay awake, wondering if God was even listening. I knew that if God was real, he'd stopped caring about me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to see my dad die, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the man who created me slip away. I wanted to remember him for who he was, not how he died. And I knew my dad would've wanted it that way too. So I curled up in a ball and waited for the news. Nobody even bothered calling me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is actually an oxymoron, combining \"old\" and \"new\" elements, as Ian Watt so astutely points out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This style has been met with both praise and criticism, with some dismissing it as lacking depth, while others hail its ability to evoke the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). At the time of its creation, Horace Walpole's \"A Gothic Story\" (as he called it) blended old theatrical elements with new, modern ideas to give birth to the Gothic genre. The Gothic style borrowed heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already seen as old-fashioned and unsophisticated compared to the more modern societal and literary advancements of the time. It was this unexpected mix of the old and the new that allowed the Gothic genre to endure and remain fresh to readers even centuries later.\n\nOne of the most significant features of Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry, which was a major part of medieval culture. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole took this concept and adapted it to suit his story, creating a knight-like character that embodied the qualities that were seen as lacking in his own time. Walpole was writing in a tumultuous era, and his work reflects his fears about the state of society. He may have believed that the morality and goodness that were once associated with the Gothic era had been lost in the present, leading him to idealize and romanticize the past. This is evident in the character of Frederic, who is described as a prince, a sufferer, and a gallant knight. His portrayal is a classic example of the chivalric ideals that were prominent in medieval culture, and it sets the stage for the excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The process of moving goods from the customer's order to the final product delivery is called supply chain management. This concept was first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver back in 1982. He described it as a series of processes that work together to deliver customer needs efficiently. There are six main components to a well-functioning supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these elements to provide top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst up is production, the foundation of the entire supply chain process. It's where you figure out when, why, where, and how products get made. To succeed, managers need to know what customers want, and they can find that out by studying the market. Once they've got a handle on customer demand, they can decide what products to make, how many, and where to produce them. They've got to choose a production location that'll meet customer needs for both volume and quality. Next, they focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment to keep things running smoothly.\n\nGetting production right is huge – every detail matters. If you mess up, it can cost a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, my past experience working at Wal-Mart and Target taught me that having clear processes in place is key. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, every step should be outlined to avoid confusion and miscommunication.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves making strategic decisions about a company's capabilities and partnerships. This might involve deciding which production divisions to use for a single product or outsourcing certain tasks to other companies. The goal is to create velocity – delivering quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "It's this sign I saw that really caught my attention: \"Hitler is alive in Burma\". I was walking down the street and Ellen Page from that movie Juno was standing there holding a weird sign with Sharpie writing on it. Burma is this country in Southeast Asia where a super strict government took over in 1962 and hasn't really changed since. There was this huge protest in 2007, it was called the Saffron Revolution, because they wore these bright orange robes, and it was the first time people had protested in like a decade. But things escalated quickly and the government started getting really violent. They rounded up all the journalists and even killed a Japanese photographer just for being there. The government said like 13 people died, but this army colonel said that's way off and that there were actually thousands.\n\nIt's not like this is new or anything. For as long as we've had civilization, governments have been trying to shut down any dissent and keep everyone in line. Even ancient Roman emperors thought they were chosen by the gods and could control everything. Japanese emperors thought they were gods too, and our current president, I'm pretty sure, has weekly meetings with some dude from the Republic Party, Ted Haggard. There have been some really crazy events like that, like the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989 where students and intellectuals were killed by the government, and the Rwandan genocide in the 90s where the government killed tons of people just because of who they were. And then there's the whole Hitler thing, but that's pretty self explanatory.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his long career and incredible musical abilities. His piano playing might not be super obvious in many of the songs we're looking at, but as a composer, Ellington was amazing at writing complex pieces that let individual band members shine. He'd create the foundation for a soloist to improvise freely, and also write tightly orchestrated parts that made the most of each band member's style. By doing this, Ellington helped bring out the unique tone of the entire orchestra, making each piece its own. He was a master at understanding how the different band members sounded individually and how they worked together, which is why he wrote some of the most groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's innovative sound and techniques, using Creole Love Call as an example of how he used voice like a jazz instrument throughout his career. This was basically an early experiment with using vocal textures and colors without worrying about lyrics. It also shows Ellington's skill at complementing the style of his soloists, which is something he did really well his whole career. This slow, bluesy twelve-bar piece is a great example - it's got six different sections, each one showcasing the band's different sounds:\n\nThe first chorus is a call-and-response thing with voice and reeds, where the voice starts off smooth and gets rougher towards the end. The second chorus has a muted trumpet solo that adds some extra flavor to the basic melody. The third chorus is a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a simple piano phrase. The fourth chorus is like a big echo of the first one, with the brass and reed sections trading calls and responses. The fifth chorus is the climax, with the reeds taking over the call-and-response and the brass and rhythm sections adding some syncopated rhythms. And the sixth chorus is like the first one, but this time the voice gets all growly and does some instrumental-style soloing.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color to his music is just one example of the cool stuff he did. In Hot and Bothered, he combined his tight orchestration skills with his ear for tone, using a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing to create a rich sound. And in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), he made great use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody.",
            "There was this huge emptiness inside her that she just couldn't shake off. It was a feeling she's had ever since she was 14 and still lingered on at 17. It started as a craving for something, but she had no idea what. She figured out that it wasn't just about things, but about people, specifically - but no one had ever caught her eye. Some guys had tried to get her attention, but every attempt just felt forced. She often found herself wondering what could be the reason behind this crazy desire. Over the years, she'd come up with some theories, but none of them really made sense to her. So, she just kept on living, always questioning her feelings.\n\nAt home, everything was usually chill. She had pretty cool parents who hardly ever argued. When they did, it was usually about her wanting to be her own person. That's because she was super outgoing and fun, like the complete opposite of her calm parents. Today, though, was a different story. As she was looking for some inspiration, she heard a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen and her mom's voice. She rushed in to find her mom on the ground, looking like she was in a lot of pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she frantically asked as she ran to her side and put a hand on her to help. Her mom said \"Ow... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital\" in a really short breath. She could tell her mom was in a lot of pain, so she helped her get off the ground and into the car.\n\nThe hospital had that weird smell of disinfectant and illness, but she was too worried about her mom to feel scared. She quickly grabbed a wheelchair and rushed in to get help. A bunch of worried faces showed up, but her mind was just on her mom. They got her mom onto a bed and took her to see a doctor. Her daughter was left to sit and stress.\n\nApparently, her mom fell off a step stool while trying to get a vase from a super high cabinet. That's how she ended up in the hospital.",
            "This study aimed to figure out if sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), which can be measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", would help lower the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The aMed diet is an adjusted version of the Med diet that's loaded with more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less saturated fat and animal products. It also allows for some booze.\n\nWe already knew from prior studies that eating the Med diet was linked to lower heart disease risk and death, but those studies didn't focus on stroke alone. This study looked at 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who were part of a huge study of female nurses in the US. The researchers tracked their eating habits over 20 years using special questionnaires. About 95% of the women stuck with the study the whole time, and the questionnaires were double-checked to make sure they were accurate.\n\nThe researchers found out what happened to the women over the years by looking at their medical records, death certificates, and hospital info. They even made some educated guesses when they couldn't find the records. They also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like weight, smoking, exercise, and whether the women took aspirin or vitamins.\n\nTo get a better idea of the women's eating habits over time, the researchers added up their aMed scores from six different questionnaires. Then they adjusted for things that could mess up the results, like age, smoking, and weight. They used a special method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how the aMed diet score affected the women's risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe study showed that women who ate the Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Over 20 years, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 heart disease deaths. Women with the highest aMed scores were 29% less likely to get heart disease or stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "It's been over a decade since the US hit rock bottom in 2007, and the aftermath of the financial crisis is still causing waves. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market tanked, and some of America's biggest corporations were left to pick up the pieces. So the question on everyone's mind is: how did this mess happen in the first place? In a nutshell, it all came down to some pretty shady and clueless decision-making by politicians who basically strong-armed banks into giving out sub-prime loans to people who couldn't afford them. At the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being pushed to buy up these dodgy mortgages and package them into some crazy financial instruments that nobody really understood. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were left high and dry and had no choice but to pass the buck to all the other financial institutions they'd sold these toxic assets to.\n\nIt all started brewing back in the Clinton era, when the President was trying to get re-elected. He wanted to boost his popularity, so he relaxed some of the lending rules, which ended up setting the stage for the sub-prime disaster to come. Steve Holmes from the New York Times was onto it back in 1999, warning that Fannie Mae was taking on too much risk by pushing mortgage loans to low-income folks and that it might all come crashing down in an economic downturn. And boy, was he right.\n\nThe economy was like a house of cards, with all these fancy new mortgage types - adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations - that just made things worse. It was like a game of financial Jenga, where everyone was over-leveraging themselves in the housing market, and when the bubble burst, it was game over. The top five investment banks were stuck with a whopping $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, which was basically a third of the US GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers went under, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to sell out to become commercial banks with tighter regulations. Fannie and Freddie were in even worse shape, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and the government had to step in to take control in 2008.",
            "But then there's that infamous part of your story, the expositional stretch where you're supposed to flex your writing muscles, but end up putting everyone to sleep instead.  You know, the spot where your readers are either nodding off or frantically hitting the \"Back\" button, cursing your name in the process.  Dr. Merlin sometimes finds herself yelling at her monitor when she gets stuck in this rut, and it's not even the good kind of yelling.\n\nExposition isn't exactly your BFF.\n\nOf course, you probably already know the \"Show, don't tell\" mantra, but Dr. Merlin still manages to get herself stuck in long, meandering passages where nothing much happens – or worse, too much happens.  It's like that pesky devil on your shoulder, urging you to get all the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the other devil telling you to spill every single juicy detail about each character's childhood).\n\nExposition is essentially just telling the audience what's going on in simple, straightforward language.  It's like the movie version, where one character lays it all out for another in a long, rambling monologue (think \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\").  In fiction, you're the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's take an example.  You're reading a story and you're hit with a barrage of info about the heroine: she met her beloved at such-and-such a place, they got hitched in a fancy wedding, and her hubby got whacked right in front of her.  You wouldn't expect that whole sequence to take up two whole pages, with the couple only getting a couple of lines of dialogue each.  You'd want the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing how much he loved the heroine through his words and actions.  You'd also want to see how much her life changed and improved with him around – especially if the story later reveals that's exactly what happened.  A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and understand the heroine's feelings, making you more invested in her story as a whole.\n\nIn short, you'd want some substance to go along with the bare-bones storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your job to provide that extra oomph.  It can be tempting to rush through certain parts, but resist the urge.  Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, works the graveyard shift at a gas station, has been married twice, doesn't have kids, and dreams of owning the gas station one day – all while secretly craving Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched the news from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first thing that caught my attention was a live report from NBC 4 in the morning. They had a story about a guy in Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife (they didn't mention her name, but that's not the point). The dude looked pretty sinister in his mug shot - I could tell it was evil written all over his face. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still developing, which I thought was just right. They mentioned that he'd stabbed her multiple times and was under arrest, but that was about it.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting that happened in the Sharon Woods area - some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot and was in pretty bad shape. There were no suspects or arrests yet, and the SWAT Team was investigating. This story was real short, and I'm guessing it was because the victim was a minority and the neighborhood was a minority one too. I've noticed before that the media doesn't give the same attention to crimes involving minorities as they do to crimes involving white people. For example, if a white kid goes missing, the media is all over it, but if a minority person is a victim, it's like it barely makes the news.\n\nThey also had a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They had some details about where it might have happened and what kind of bullet was used - a .22 caliber from a rifle, I think. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for any tips that could lead to the shooter's arrest.\n\nNext up was a story about the weather forecast for the weekend, which sounded pretty typical for Columbus - rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, with highs in the mid to low eighties. They made it clear that this was just a teaser to keep us watching, so we'd stick around.\n\nThey also had a report on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They said the perpetrator was a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. What struck me was how much they emphasized his race and how dark he was - it seemed a bit excessive, if you ask me.\n\nThe last story I remember was about Rene Rodriguez, a guy who'd been convicted of being a big-time marijuana dealer from Texas. He'd been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute weed to Ohio from Texas. I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve by saying \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" - maybe they thought it sounded harsher or something. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I'm not sure why that was relevant to the story.",
            "There's something unbreakable between brothers – a connection that can't be broken or undone. This bond is made up of tons of emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty – to name just a few. Brothers know each other in a way that nobody else does, and when they look at their brother, they see a reflection of themselves. In tough times, this bond really shows its true colors, whether it's good or bad. But with these emotions comes a price. Part of understanding this bond is dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you can stare a brother in the face and see your own reflection staring back, you see yourself as you really are, not as others see you. It's in their actions and the results of those actions that you find out who they really are. In the classic novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers explore this idea, and all the crazy emotions that come with it. The two boys go on a wild adventure through a super vivid landscape, but it all ends in disaster. A huge mix of bitter disappointment and intense pride comes to a head, and only one brother makes it out alive. The author conveys this theme through the characters' actions, especially the main guy, Doodle, and their interactions with each other. The narrator also plays a key role by showing us how the protagonist feels about the world and how that affects his decisions.\n\nFor the protagonist, it all comes down to one main emotion: pride. From the very beginning, when he and his little brother Doodle first go on an adventure, to their final, disastrous trip, he's always feeling resentful towards Doodle. He wanted a brother who could keep up with him and learn all the cool stuff he knew, like holding his breath and climbing trees. He wanted someone to share his fun with, like racing to the top of a big pine tree and perching in the branches. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, so it was pretty unlikely he'd ever be able to do any of those things. The protagonist's dreams were crushed when that reality hit him. He even had thoughts of getting rid of Doodle, which is pretty messed up. But when Doodle smiles at him, all his anger melts away and he feels a surge of love. This shows that his anger wasn't as strong as he thought. Deep down, he's got a soft spot for his little bro.",
            "The brain is a super cool, super complicated machine that processes info all the time. As technology got way more advanced, people started using more and more fancy metaphors to describe the brain too. First, they compared it to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now it's like a computer. But, it's super important to keep in mind that these metaphors aren't perfect and can lead to some pretty wacky conclusions.\n\nSo, here's how the brain works: it gets all this sensory info from our eyes, ears, and other stuff, and turns it into electrical signals. Then, the brain starts messing with this info over and over in different ways. There are two main kinds of processing: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, your brain puts together tiny pieces of info like color and shape to figure out that it's a box. But then, your brain also uses what it already knows to help you figure out what you're looking at even faster.\n\nBut, there's another step - the brain decides how important the info is and whether you should be paying attention to it or not. Like, you're walking down the street and you see a bunch of blades of grass, but your brain doesn't make you notice them because they're not super important. But, if someone calls out your name in a crowded room, your brain is all like, \"Hey, I should pay attention to that!\"\n\nNow, for the brain to work, it needs to store info somehow. There are different types of memory, like short-term and long-term, and sensory memory. When we first get info, we need to encode it, which is like translating it into a language the brain can understand. For example, if you see a word, your brain can figure out what it looks like, what it sounds like, or what it means. Then, the brain has to keep that info stored somehow. Scientists think that short-term memory works because it's like a special electrical signal that loops through a bunch of neurons for a little while. Long-term memory, on the other hand, might be stored in the structure of special proteins in the brain.\n\nThere are a bunch of different theories about how the brain stores knowledge, some based on how people remember things, some based on computer science, and some based on brain stuff. One theory is that the brain is like a big network with nodes that represent ideas and concepts, and the nodes are all connected because they're related. For example, if you think of the word \"chair,\" your brain might also think of \"table,\" which might remind you of \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley warns us about the dangers of technology and the effects of the capitalistic system in his dystopian novel Brave New World. In this world, people value community over individuality and are conditioned to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, who dictates their ideology. By looking at the book through the lens of Marxist theory, we can see that Huxley is questioning the growth of these systems. Marxist ideas like homogeny and reification are sprinkled throughout the novel, showing that Huxley is saying that these systems have some major flaws.\n\nCapitalism is also criticized in the novel through the concept of false consciousness. This is where people are kept in the dark about the real relationship between different classes in society, and they're more worried about their own gain. It's like the World Controller has a tight grip on the common folks, making them want to buy, spend, and indulge in stuff. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, are basically robots, doing what they're told without any free will of their own. They're conditioned with hypnopædia to be obsessed with consuming and spending. The World Controller is behind all of this, making the lower classes think they're part of the system, when really they're just pawns.\n\nThe idea of hegemony is also used in the novel, where a small group of people are in control of the whole society. The lower classes are completely clueless about this, they're just 'buying into' an ideology that helps keep the system going. The upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, know what's going on, but they just go along with it. But not everyone is like that, some characters like Bernard see through the system, but they're the exception.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are basically non-existent. The characters are pretty shallow, even the main ones, and they don't really have any depth. Huxley might be saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and individuality. Love and strong emotions are non-existent, and people just go through the motions. It's all pretty superficial, with guys commenting on girls' looks and girls talking about their sex lives. The fact that everyone's okay with their place in society shows how capitalism is affecting people's lives. They're all just following the rules and doing what they're told, like the proletariat in Marxist theory, who are told they're better than everyone else as long as they keep consuming and obeying.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for like two and a half years now, which is basically four and a half semesters of trying to navigate this campus. For many of us, getting around here can be a major pain. My freshman year, I was stuck in East Halls dorm, which is basically as far east as you can go without hitting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Going to classes in places like the Willard building, which is literally in the middle of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when it's all gross outside. I talked to an alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not too long ago, East Halls was basically its own separate entity from the rest of the school. There used to be this huge empty space between it and the rest of campus, but now it's all been filled in with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder and harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? On a college campus, it's gotta be the bicycle. But, let's be real, having a bike isn't enough - students need to actually ride them, and the campus needs to be set up to accommodate cyclists.\n\nI was talking to a friend who just got back into biking after a few years off, and he was saying how he had no idea why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the way to go,\" he said. \"For a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is biking good for your body, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. You can eat a bowl of oatmeal and get 30 miles or more out of it - all while getting some exercise. I now live off campus, which is basically as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I've got class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. Riding a bike cuts that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always the easiest road to travel on, bike or no bike. I've gotta say, walking has its pros, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option, and it would take up way too much of my time. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day, which is over two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's just more time than I can spare."
