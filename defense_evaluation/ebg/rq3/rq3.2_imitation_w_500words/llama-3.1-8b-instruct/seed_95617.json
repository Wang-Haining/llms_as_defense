            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm planning to go into social work and eventually land a job with the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to help out kids who've been through a tough time and offer support to their families. Some values that I think are super important for my career are service, respect, and being ethical - I want to make sure I'm helping people and relationships in the best way possible, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills so I can be the best social worker I can be. These aren't just principles that I think are cool for social workers - they're also really important to me personally.\n\nI've always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure what career path to take. In high school and college, I saw a lot of people dodging their problems or using not-so-great coping mechanisms. After seeing so many people dealing with tough stuff, I decided to study Psychology in college. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still unsure about what to do next. One summer day, I visited a friend and met a 16-year-old kid who was really stressed out. He was trying to escape his abusive parents, and it was pretty eye-opening for me. The next day, I found out he'd called the cops on his parents. I drove over to their place and told the police about my concerns and my degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I asked them about the situation, they seemed really nervous and tried to make excuses for their son's behavior. That experience made me think seriously about going into social work to help kids deal with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is another important value for me in the social work field. We say that every individual matters, but I think people just say that because it sounds good - we tend to follow old ways of thinking rather than being truly unique. That's why I'm not into trying to fit in with everyone else. I've always stood up for what I believe in: coloring my hair weird colors, wearing clothes that show my personality, getting piercings, joining GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I see it. I'm all about social justice and I'm going to keep speaking out against things that aren't right.",
            "This paper examines the intersection of biological and sociocultural models in understanding the sleep disorder, insomnia. The biological model delves into the genetic factors and medical aspects that contribute to the condition, while the sociocultural model explores environmental influences, demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Below is an overview of the research related to each model and how they shed light on the complexities of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health issues, and sleep problems caused by medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, involve difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder, are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep. Insomnia specifically refers to a persistent difficulty in sleeping.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders zeroes in on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects that influence sleep patterns. Research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, as crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study found that mice lacking phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons exhibited disrupted sleep-wake cycles. Activating the GABAA receptor enhanced sleep, while inhibiting it reduced anxiety and induced sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This study implies that a genetic or environmental issue with this receptor could affect a person's ability to sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study suggest that inherited traits could regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor might naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life and tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into three main areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a brief rundown on what CAPD is all about. Next, diagnosis is explained, including the key signs or \"red flags\" that point to the condition. Finally, the paper wraps up with ways that a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, is a condition where the brain can't quite process the sounds we hear, even though we can hear them just fine. So it's not like we're hearing-impaired, but more like our brain has trouble sorting out what we're hearing - like separating words from background noise. This disorder is also known as (C)AP, which refers to the way our central nervous system (CNS) handles auditory information and the brain activity that goes along with it.\n\nCAPD first showed up in research back in the 1950s under the name \"auditory imperception\". It started to gain some attention in the 1950s, when researchers were looking into kids with communication disorders, and the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests to help identify these kids. In the 1960s, Kimura came up with a way to test this condition using a technique called dichotic testing, and came up with a model to explain how the brain works when it comes to hearing sounds.\n\nPeople with CAPD might have a range of problems - they might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from, or distinguishing between different sounds, or even recognizing patterns in sounds. They might struggle to pick up on changes in voice or tone, or have trouble making sense of sound clues. They might even have trouble figuring out the order of sounds. \n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, you need to get a closer look at how they process sound. This can involve observing their listening behavior and testing their auditory skills with a range of tools and techniques, including questionnaires and surveys, and even recording the sounds inside their ears to see how their brain responds. There isn't one single test that's foolproof, and there's no known cause for the condition. Some tests present a bunch of sounds at once and ask the person to pick out specific sounds, while more advanced tests measure how their brain responds to different sounds.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that when you pretend to be someone else for a long time, it can be super helpful in fooling people, but at the end of the day, you've got to let go of that disguise or risk losing yourself completely. The thing is, giving up a deception can be tough because it might make you feel really disconnected from the people around you. So, you're basically stuck with a choice between being true to yourself or keeping your relationships intact. Some people might just shrug it off when they find out they've been tricked, but others will not be so cool about it and might even get really upset about the whole thing.\n\nDeception can be especially tricky when it comes to switching up your gender, because it raises a lot of questions. Like, why would someone feel the need to hide who they really are and pretend to be the opposite gender? In Twelfth Night, Viola's got a pretty obvious reason - she wants to protect herself from people who might try to hurt her. She says, \"I'll take you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) She's saying she needs to pretend to be a man to stay safe.\n\nBut here's the thing, pretending to be a man makes Viola feel cut off from the women around her, and she even gets confused with her twin brother Sebastian, which makes things way more complicated. Olivia starts falling for Cesario (Viola in disguise), and Viola's also got feelings for Orsino, but she's too scared to express them. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261) It's pretty wild to think that Twelfth Night might be showing how pretending to be someone else can help you figure out your real feelings, like what's going on with Olivia and Orsino.\n\nOne thing that's pretty interesting is that Shakespeare might be using Olivia as a commentary on how people judge others based on how they look. I mean, Olivia is really attracted to Cesario at first, but then she totally switches gears and starts seeing Cesario as family instead of a love interest. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) It's like Shakespeare is saying that people might be attracted to things that don't make sense, or that they might be using disguise to explore their own feelings.",
            "People have been talking about how brutal German colonial rule was, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. But it's way more complicated than just saying that - the German colonial empire was super varied in terms of policies and ruling styles, just like the different places it was in. Even education systems across the colonies were pretty different. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that there were tons of educated and literate Africans living there. The Germans had actually done a pretty good job of educating people in some of their other colonies, like Kamerun, if you can believe it. \n\nBut South West Africa (where Namibia is now) was like a whole different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government was involved in educating the locals, in South West Africa, the job was pretty much left to missionary groups that got hardly any help from the government. Although the government did invest in educating Europeans living in the colony, setting up schools and stuff, and also kind of regulating the missionary schools. These education policies had some pretty long-lasting effects in South West Africa, even after the Germans lost control. While other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans, in South West Africa, most people were still pretty much uneducated and illiterate. There were a bunch of different reasons for this, and my paper is going to try to figure out what they were, especially by looking at new research about how the settlers and colonial officials felt about the native Africans.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of books and articles about education in the German colonies out there, but most of them are in German and were written during or right after the time of German colonial rule. Most of them just describe what the education systems were like in the different colonies, but later ones did more detailed studies and comparisons. One of the most important ones is a study by Cohen that compares education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen thinks that the big difference between the two is because South West Africa had a lot of settlers, which affected how the colony was run.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as harsh in terms of climate as some of the other German colonies, but it was still pretty dry, especially in some areas. As a result, the European population there was bigger than in some of the other colonies - by 1913 there were almost 15,000 whites living there, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next biggest settler population, East Africa.",
            "It's hard to list all the different kinds of popular music because the classification has gotten way more complicated over the past 100 years. The thing is, a lot of genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have spawned even more sub and sub-sub genres. Heavy metal rock, which is one of the more diverse and expressive genres, has gotten really crazy in the past 40 years. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly on the darker side, but that's what makes it so unique. People started experimenting with it early on and created their own sub-genres, which led to even more sub-sub-genres. Now it's gotten to the point where it's hard to figure out what heavy metal even is.\n\nBut to understand the metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta know where it came from and why it's a movement, not just a genre. Heavy metal is all about being dark - it's like the 'music of more' with more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more drama. Metal bands are all about being skilled musicians and it shows in their music. Plus, a lot of metal is influenced by psychedelia - a big drug boom in the 70s led to people making crazy music that was out of this world. It's all about the dark, raw emotions that people were feeling, which was new to the music scene back then. Later metal bands even took inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark vibes. Check out these lyrics from Helter Skelter - it's like a wild ride of emotions, almost like a rollercoaster of feelings. Some people even consider it one of the first heavy metal songs ever, and it was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was already on the heavier side. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they added that song to The White Album.",
            "A whole bunch of years before these Surrealist dudes started painting their trippy masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was secretly painting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a painting from 1910, is like a symbol of this, showing a woman who's totally amazed by the awesome things she sees in her dream world. But it's also super personal, representing Rousseau's own hopes and dreams as an artist - he wanted to be famous, have people like his artwork, and be accepted by other artists and art enthusiasts. But here's the thing: he was stuck with a major internal conflict - should he try to be like everyone else and paint like they do, or be true to himself and do his own thing? The Dream is basically Rousseau's artistic struggle in a nutshell: to play it safe and be accepted by the art world, or to be unique and forge his own path.\n\nTo really get what's going on in The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. This guy was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France called Laval. His dad was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who had a pretty comfy life, but Rousseau didn't have any art training - he just worked a regular job until he was 40, and then started painting as a way to cope with the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight kids. After that, he had one kid left, Julia, and was totally heartbroken. He hoped painting would give him a fresh start. Unlike other artists of his time who made a big deal about painting peasants and stuff, Rousseau was more of a folk painter, just making art like regular people do.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition is pretty understandable when you think about it: he was basically a self-taught painter who started way later in life, and was working at the same time as all these other famous artists. It's like, he finally got some respect for his art around the same time that Matisse was starting to become a big deal. According to Jan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were like total opposites - Matisse hated painting boring stuff, while Rousseau just wanted to make something so normal that everyone would like it and accept him as a real artist.",
            "Lots of smart people have said that ethics and beauty are connected, that truth and beauty are basically the same thing. I think there's a reason for this deep connection. As John Keats said in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we know in life comes from school or experience, but we seem to get into ethics and aesthetics in our own way, like Keats said. Both ethics and aesthetics are like trying to describe what makes something beautiful or right, rather than giving a list of rules to follow. We're always talking about why a painting or a book is good, but we can't quite put our finger on it. When someone asks what you like about a favorite work of art or literature, it's usually something like, \"There's just something about it\" before they try to explain it in more detail. I think that art and morals can't be fully explained - they're like something that's too deep to be described. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how hard you try to describe a work of literature, there's still something special about it that can't be captured. I think ethics is the same way. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think that this \"something\" that's hard to put into words is what makes art and morality so powerful, and that's what connects them.\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because they both touch us at a deep, almost unknowable level. We can feel it, but we can't quite explain it. This connection is even stronger with literature. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a powerhouse today, a single country with a unique mix of cultures. From the shadow of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, you can feel the same vibe. It's the same culture that runs through Köln on the Rhine River, right through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Considering all this, it's no big surprise that Germany, as we know it now, is made up of different parts from various tribes. \n\nThe roots of Germany, or Germania, are a topic of heated debate among scholars and historians. One of the most famous theories is that the name comes from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that lived before they crossed the Rhine and fought against the Gauls. However, this is disputed, and some people think the name might have come from a neighborly term in the Gaulish language. Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and fought against tribes that crossed the Rhine often with unclear motives. He might have taken this word from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes that he hadn't conquered yet. \n\nIn his first chapter of the first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine and were constantly at war with the Gauls, fighting almost daily battles. Others think the name Germany might come from the spear called a \"ger\" used in warfare or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud and noisy. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were originally from the region and hadn't mixed with other cultures at all. He thought it was crazy that anyone would leave their home in Asia or Africa for Italy and then move to Germany, with its harsh environment, rough weather, and tough people, unless it was their true home. \n\nIt was the same with the Romans. They would conquer the lands of Germania for resources and occasionally lead a land campaign, but they mostly just returned home to their empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills with the Romans by serving in their army.",
            "I stood there staring blankly in front of me, my mind completely numb to the scene in front of me.  It was like I was a robot, just going through the motions, studying the picture without really thinking about it.  Thoughts kept popping into my head and then quickly disappearing, like they were just passing through.  I felt like I was just along for the ride, not really in control of my own thoughts.\n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was six years old.  So, when an artist friend suggested I get a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, I jumped at the chance.  It's like a tutorial on how to use your brain to draw, teaching you stuff like what a pencil is and how your brain interprets lines.  One of the cool things it teaches is to draw a square frame around the picture you're looking at, so it's not overwhelming.  Like, take a picture of a bunch of fruit on a table in a kitchen - it's just too much to take in.  But with a frame, it's like, just a picture of that fruit on a plain background.\n\nBut at that moment, staring at the fruit in front of me, I couldn't even think about drawing a frame.  I was just in awe, completely blown away by what I was seeing.  I felt like I was a real artist, like I was on the verge of creating something amazing.  I was thinking about all the great artists who came before me, people like Picasso and Monet - they all had their own styles and colors.  If I was going to be an artist, I wanted to be known for something too, so I started thinking about my own style, my own vision.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for my pencil, my muscles tensed up and then relaxed as I gripped it tightly.  I was ready to create something amazing, to bring my vision to life.  But then my mind went blank again, and all I could think about was the toilet.  Specifically, the brown mess that someone had left in it.  I tried to flush it away, but it just wouldn't budge.  I stood there, frowning, staring at the mess, feeling like a total failure.  I gripped the mop tightly, ready to tackle the mess, but my hand just sort of hung there, like it was waiting for instructions.  I finally managed to muster up the energy to grab the toilet paper and start mopping up the mess, but it was a total struggle.  I felt like I was in a trance, just going through the motions, not really thinking about what I was doing.  It was like I was a robot, just programmed to clean up after other people.",
            "A lot of teenagers are driving into trouble and accidents behind the wheel.  There are a bunch of factors at play here.  One reason is that teenagers' brains just aren't ready for the dangers of driving yet.  Plus, they're super inexperienced, which leads not only to more fatal crashes but also more vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  And things get even worse when they're driving with their friends - which, let's be real, is pretty much all the time.  Researchers found that the older the passengers in the car, the more accidents happen. \nSome states, like California, have tried to make driving safer for teens by giving them limited driver's licenses that restrict how long they can drive and who can ride with them.  But honestly, these temporary licenses are just band-aids on a bigger issue.  The problem is that as a group, teenagers are just not capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license.  He's found that a lot of people under 19-20 love taking risks just for the thrill of it, and it makes sense to wait until that urge dies down a bit before letting them drive.  If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing fatal crashes and the death toll will be huge.  By 2010, a huge number of new teen drivers will be hitting the road, and it's going to be a disaster.  \nSo, what to do?  We could keep teaching driver's ed in schools to get them started, but no one under 18 should be able to drive.  A provisional permit could still be issued beforehand, and they'd need a certain number of practice hours with a licensed driver.  We should just make this a national rule so it's the same everywhere.  It's not a new idea, but it's a good one.",
            "I spent the day in the Library of Congress's archive of old Edison films and watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and they were all pretty clever. These films use editing tricks to create illusions, and my project was to study their poetics and see how they evolved over time. At first glance, these trick films seem pretty straightforward: they're set in a single room, rarely use camera movement, and stick to one shot per film. But, if you look closer, some of the later films start to break the rules by experimenting with multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that really stands out about these films is that they're all shot in front of a stationary camera, which never moves to follow the action. This style was super common back then and came from the theater, vaudeville, and magic shows. The problem with filming in a static setting is that characters can only move side to side – they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Take the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) for example. The actors come in from the side and just kind of mill around in place.\n\nSince the camera doesn't move, most shots in these films are long shots or medium shots. You almost never see close-ups, which was influenced by the theater and vaudeville traditions where the whole performance was visible at once, framed by the edges of the stage. Actors in these early films never move towards the camera, so close-ups just aren't an option.\n\nMost of these trick films follow a one-shot-per-film rule, which limits them to just a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also means they're mostly just short, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and switching acts with minimal story. However, it's worth noting that what looks like one shot to the viewer can actually be several shots joined together to create an illusion. If you look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), you can see where the physical shots start and stop, even though it's all one shot in your mind.",
            "So, you wanna know about John Taylor of Caroline, right? Well, he was a total die-hard Republican back in the day. This guy was all about farming and politics, which made him super outspoken about personal freedom and government stuff. He was all about preserving and promoting agriculture, and that's basically how he thought about everything, including the government. He wanted to keep it simple and fair, you know? He believed that a farm was the best career, and that's how he built his whole philosophy on government and the Constitution.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a chance to create the ultimate system without being held back by old customs, so he was all about self-government and doing things the right way. He believed in the natural rights of people, like freedom and stuff, and he thought they were all connected - if one was taken away, they'd all suffer. He wanted those rights to be totally off-limits to the government. He thought the \"state of nature\" was all about the strong and mean taking advantage, but in civilization, that shouldn't be how it goes down.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought a government should be built with both good and bad in mind. He was super strict about his ideas on good and evil, and he said that a government's virtues and flaws are basically human too. He thought good principles should be about protecting people's property, improving farming, and not being too capitalist, and that a government with good principles would work out okay no matter who's in charge, even if they're all about personal gain. But, he believed that self-interest is basically human nature, and it's only bad when it's all about taking from others. A good government is needed to keep people's bad sides in check, but it's gotta be watched closely so it doesn't get worse.\n\nTaylor was like a lot of other Republicans back then - he wanted the Constitution to be taken super literally, with the government only having the powers it was given. He thought a big government is expensive and might be a dictatorship, but he also didn't want it to be too simple or literal, 'cause that could lead to problems. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was the real deal, 'cause it said the US was a bunch of states, not just one country.",
            "Looking back at the data in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. It was pretty discouraging and it's hard to figure out why this happened. One possible reason could be the onset of winter at our New England campus, which usually leads to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Also, with the end of the fall semester, people are super busy with schoolwork, grades, and other stuff, so it's easy to forget about the commuter log. Plus, December is the start of the holiday season and everyone's on break, which means fewer people need to come to campus. It wasn't until the spring semester picked up again in late January that things started to look up. However, the low number of submissions in February still didn't make sense. I wondered if it's just that any project like this has a burst of energy at the beginning that eventually fades away. To combat this, we tried the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which actually worked and got people excited again. It was tough to keep the project going, especially with the holiday and semester breaks that always come up in college. \n\nAnother challenge for this project (and probably any other commuting project) is that people really love the freedom, independence, and flexibility that comes with driving their own cars. This is just how our culture is. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we need to offer some pretty sweet incentives. So, we gave out gift cards to all sorts of places like restaurants, coffee shops, and even a local bookstore. It would've been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, would've affected participation. Maybe it could've even helped us get back on track after that dip in engagement. One thing that didn't change throughout the project was the kind of prizes we offered. If we had announced some bigger prizes in the middle of the project, like a bike in December and a hybrid car in January, it might've made people more excited to participate. The gift cards were cool at first, but who wouldn't be even more stoked if they knew they could win a sick new set of wheels?",
            "I recently learned about exchange traded funds, or ETFs for short. These securities are super flexible and offer the benefits of owning individual stocks, like being able to sell short or buy on margin, but they also give you the diversification of an index fund. Plus, the expense ratios of ETFs are way lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, like the commission fees you pay on each trade, just like when you're buying or selling a stock. Another cool thing about ETFs is the huge variety of funds available, but it's always a good idea for smart investors to check if the benefits they're promised really live up to their hype. For this project, we're going to take a closer look at the ETF IHF and see how its top 10 holdings stack up against owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. We're only looking at the top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets, since going over every single holding would be a bit too much. Here's what we found:\n\nTo get a better sense of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can calculate the contributions of each stock to its Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF holds them. Check out the chart below to see the results.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a return that's 6.11% higher than the ETF IHF, which is a pretty sweet 16% boost. What's more, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's, which could be a good thing. But before we get too excited, we need to make sure these results aren't just a fluke. To do that, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare it to the ETF IHF's standard deviation. Stay tuned to see what we find out!",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is widely considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's best poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" which, according to Mabbott, has its roots in Virgil's work. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world in Greek mythology. But what's more interesting is that Poe was heavily influenced by German authors, and one in particular - Gothe. Poe's familiarity with Gothe's writing is evident in his use of \"Thulé\". \n\nThis connection is reinforced by Karl J. Arndt's observation in his book on Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, which notes the striking similarities between the two poems, suggesting that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature also highlights Gothe's notable works, including the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts, first in 1808 and then in 1832, the year of Gothe's passing. Within Faust, there's a poem called \"The King of Thulé\" that tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. The king then becomes a heavy drinker, mourning his lost love. He eventually decides it's his time to die and passes on his possessions, save for the goblet, and throws it into the ocean before taking his own life. The similarities between the King of Thulé and the character in \"Dream-Land\" are uncanny, and some might see it as a darker reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction. Interestingly, Faust was later adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". \n\nPoe references \"ultrama Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", but in \"Dream-Land\", he uses \"Thule\" as a bookend, framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" echoing the themes of loss, loneliness, and a desolate landscape found in \"The King of Thulé\". The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes Thule as a dark, lonely place haunted by the ghosts of dead friends, a world devoid of color. This mirrors the King of Thulé's experience after losing his wife, and it's as if Poe is stepping into Goethe's poem. Given Poe's respect for Tennyson, it's likely he would have been familiar with Goethe's work, and the many reproductions of his works that were being published at the time further solidified Poe's connection to Goethe's writing.",
            "So, I'm wondering if a person could get punitive damages in court if they got hurt in a grocery store after slipping on an applesauce spill because the manager was super careless. He knew there was a mess, but he didn't bother to clean it up for over half an hour because he was eating dinner. He'd been told about the spill not once, but twice. A judge wouldn't just dismiss the person's claim for punitive damages. To get those damages, the person would have to show that the manager did something super bad on purpose, like ignoring the harm it could cause. They'd also have to prove that the manager's actions were really bad and showed a huge disregard for how his actions could affect others. In this case, the person could argue that the manager should have known that not cleaning up the spill would hurt someone, especially since multiple people slipped on the same thing in the months leading up to the accident. The manager still didn't take action, even after knowing this. The person's argument that the manager's actions were really bad is kinda weak, but it's still a valid point since there were six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager still didn't do anything to keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee told the manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in the store. Martin said he was eating dinner and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee told him again, but he still didn't do anything. At 5:30 pm, the person who got hurt, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got seriously hurt. Before that, there were five other slip-and-fall incidents in the same store in 2009. Now Palmer is suing the store for both compensation and punitive damages, and we're looking at whether to file a motion to get the punitive damage claim thrown out.\n\nIn California, a person can get punitive damages if the other person did something super mean, like being really cruel or lying to them. The law says that's when someone acts on purpose to hurt someone, or when they don't intend to hurt someone, but they do something really bad and show a huge disregard for other people's safety. The court has said that's when someone knows their actions could cause harm and they still do it anyway.",
            "It's crazy how a class I took almost four years ago in Islam at CBC still has me thinking about this topic.  The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion was a huge deal back then, and I think it's more relevant now than ever.  Since 9/11, I've noticed that mass media has gone from being really negative about Islam and extremists to being super tolerant of it in America - it's like a total 180.  In 2001, I don't think a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his obvious Muslim background, would've even been a possibility.\n\nI'm actually pretty fascinated by the biography of the Prophet Muhammad.  What I learned about him seems to contradict the personality people usually think of when they hear his name.  I thought he was some kind of conqueror who forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a totally different picture - Muhammad as a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  It's like people came to see the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out one by one. \n\nIt's wild how similar some of his 'miracles' are to those of Jesus - like when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed a huge crowd.  The way it's written makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but just lived in truth and did miracles.  To me, this is a major problem because it downplays the life and miracles of Jesus.  It's like they're trying to take credit for Jesus' life by portraying Muhammad as a similar figure.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that seem like they're trying to show how people came to Islam on their own, but most of them are third-hand accounts.  I'm not a fan of this because it makes the stories seem suspicious and takes away from their impact.  I think their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, but it actually does the opposite.\n\nWhat really gets me is how the biography tries to make Muhammad out to be this awesome, godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle.  But history says otherwise - Muhammad was a pretty powerful guy who rose to power in a way that doesn't exactly scream 'gentle'.  I wonder if Muslims today know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and values that Jesus had during his lifetime were pretty much left behind in the development of Christianity after he passed away.  If we look at the history of Christianity, it's like watching a ship drift further and further away from its original course. It's clear that today, more and more people are starting to wake up and realize that they've been sailing in the wrong direction. While some traditional folks will stick to what they've been taught, they might not be enough to steer the whole crew back on track. A growing number of people will become more aware of their history and start to crave a return to the original intentions of Jesus and his teachings. It might take a while – decades or even centuries – but it's inevitable that eventually, there will be a major shift. The tide of Christian history will start moving in reverse, stripping away the extra baggage that's accumulated over time, and getting back to the basics. It'll be like rewinding a tape, until all that's left is a clear picture of what Jesus actually preached about. \n\nThis movement will sweep across countries like the US and Europe, influencing millions and bringing people back to the essentials of Jesus' teachings. The church, as an institution, will still be strong enough to lead the way. But as a result of this shift, the diverse and complex landscape of Christianity will simplify into more uniformity. Instead of seeing a million different interpretations and practices, we'll see more and more similarities across the board. Human history's full of these kinds of reversals – think of how Christians used to be persecuted by the Roman Empire, but later it became a Christian institution. We've seen how our country moved from slavery to equality for African-Americans. This big reversal that's coming in the future will happen within Christianity, and it'll be a journey back to the source, leaving diversity behind. A key part of this process will be learning to interpret Jesus' words in a metaphorical way, rather than taking them literally. So, what happened to Jesus' teachings over time?\n\nLooking way back into history, we find that the only thing before Christianity was Judaism. The core of this faith included monotheism, the idea of a divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 BCE, the Jewish people weren't a single, unified group. They were divided into different factions, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "I think that The Jungle really shows us what people are like deep down inside - we're all pretty greedy and self-centered. We only want to make our own lives as good as possible and look out for ourselves, but we don't really care about anyone else. The Jungle shows this in a lot of ways, but one of the most obvious is with the bosses of the big factories. All they care about is making their companies super successful and getting as much money as possible. They don't care if anyone gets hurt or if anything gets in their way. Upton Sinclair's writing, like when he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky\", really paints a picture of all the damage that's being done. He's showing how the bosses don't care about anyone or anything that might get hurt by their factories - the pollution, the animal waste, none of it matters to them.\n\nThe bosses also didn't care about their employees, who were working super hard to make them rich. They'd do whatever it took to make a little extra money, and they didn't care who got hurt in the process, \"So it was like one big pot of jealousy and hatred; nobody had any loyalty or decency, and nobody was worth anything more than a dollar\". They made their employees work super long hours and then fired them randomly without any help or notice. Back when The Jungle was written, there weren't really any laws to protect workers, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. The people who worked and lived in Packingtown were basically expected to just deal with the terrible conditions - nobody was there to help them. There were some unions, but they mostly just made money off the workers. The workers were treated like slaves, and that's basically what they were - they were stuck in a system with no way out, and they were described as being as miserable as people were under slavery.",
            "Authors often use various techniques to shape the mood or attitude of their readers towards significant topics. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He sometimes pairs words that normally don't go together to create a distinct atmosphere around an object or subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, and then uses it to evoke a certain feeling. Fitzgerald frequently uses this second technique with colors, particularly gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops the meanings of white/gray and then uses them to create a particular impression of a significant object.\n\nFitzgerald builds up the meaning of white/gray by repeatedly using them in the novel. He associates white with being fancy and high-class, with gray being more dull and faded. Fitzgerald introduces this association early on, showing how characters like Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\" (8). Everyone at parties is wearing white, from Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) to Tom's \"white shirt\" (36). Even the environment is described as having a uniform appearance: the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40) when Nick isn't at a party. To reinforce this association, Fitzgerald describes ordinary, insignificant things with these colors: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and people's names are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. He even uses these colors to describe plain or common people and places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26).\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. He starts by applying this technique to Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), making her seem less like a character and more like an accessory Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique more extensively around Daisy to give her an impression of being a uniform addition, for instance, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she's again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a goldmine for agricultural production thanks to its awesome weather. They grow a lot of stuff there like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. It's super in-demand to buy organic food directly from local farmers in the area, with so many people waiting in line to get their hands on it. People are also super into getting their eggs and milk from organic farms. Some of these farms even let people come and explore their operations, and you can go hiking, birdwatching, or just chill there. It's like a win-win situation for the landowner, 'cause they get to get some cash and also help out the environment. This is especially cool 'cause it lets them qualify for government programs that'll help 'em out.\n\nNot only does organic farming bring in some cash, it also makes the area way more diverse in terms of plants and animals. Without all the chemicals, the soil and water are basically a party for all the little critters. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - organic farming can be more expensive in some ways. For example, it takes a lot more work to get rid of pests and weeds, and you gotta put in extra effort to fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Plus, you might end up losing more stuff than you would with regular farming methods. And, if you're a small farm, you're at a disadvantage 'cause big farms are way more efficient. There are other things you can do to help the environment that aren't even about organic farming, like planting special crops to keep pests away, rotating your animals to keep the land healthy, and getting rid of invasive species. All these things can be a real time suck, though.\n\nFor this example, I chose a piece of land in the East County Southern Foothills of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. It's a 160-acre chunk of chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. They're still working on the plan, but it's got over a hundred different plants and animals on the list, some of which are super endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are in danger of becoming endangered, like the burrowing owl. This land has been home to Native Americans for who-knows-how-long and was later settled by cattle ranchers and people who sold cordwood back in the 1800s. It was part of an original homestead, so it was probably used for grazing and making wood for a long time.\n\nI picked a real estate listing and looked up what government programs are out there to help small farmers save cash and keep their operations eco-friendly. To get an idea of what it's like, I looked at an actual organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. You can figure out a lot about a culture by looking at what it's not, rather than what it actually is. This culture thing isn't one big, uniform thing - it's super diverse and can change depending on the situation. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are way too broad and oversimplify things. It's way more helpful to understand what a culture means in this specific situation and how that culture might affect the conversation. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you're gonna relate to it in your own way, and comparisons are gonna pop up.\n\nIt can take some work to grasp another culture or mindset - you might have to study its history, or try to understand its prejudices. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, just accept it for what it is and work with it. This is especially true in negotiations, especially if you're in a weaker position. If you're \"on the road\" and need to navigate a different culture, showing respect for their traditions and values can actually help you get past any cultural barriers and move the conversation forward.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture isn't just about where you come from or where you're going - it can be something as small as a company's corporate culture. For example, some companies are super strict about working hours, while others are way more relaxed. You can see this in employee dress codes, the way people communicate, and even how they hire people. Take American corporate culture - it's totally different from company to company (and even within companies, it can vary from region to region). Some cultures seem super uniform, but that just means you gotta dig deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important because it helps you understand why a culture does things a certain way. If saving face or keeping things harmonious is a big deal in a culture, you won't see anyone publicly embarrassing themselves or their boss to get ahead. On the other hand, if a culture values getting a tough deal, they won't be in a rush to settle. Knowing these kinds of things can really help before you get to the negotiation table. But you should also try to learn a bit about your opponent as an individual to make the negotiations go smoothly.",
            "There's this famous Bible verse - \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" - and it's found in Psalm 14. St. Anselm used this quote to start his argument for the existence of God. It's also believed by another big thinker, Thomas Aquinas. Since both of them are trying to prove the same idea, we'll just assume they're both right, because if we use a different idea of God, it'd be hard to compare their arguments. If we do that, it's like comparing apples and oranges. Let's just say they both believe in the Christian God for simplicity's sake. Now, I think both of them have some good points, but neither of them really gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He says that we can understand God by looking inside ourselves. He thinks that because we can't really imagine a world without God, that means God must be real. This idea is really like looking at what we already know inside our minds and using that to figure out the truth about God. St. Anselm says we don't need any other proof, that our own understanding is enough. This way of thinking is often called faith in Christian texts. It's like trusting something even if we can't prove it.\n\nThis is different from how Thomas Aquinas thinks. He says that we can prove God exists using logic and things we can see, not just faith. This would be super helpful for spreading the word about Christianity because people wouldn't have to believe it just because someone told them to. They could use their brains to figure it out. St. Thomas presents five different logical reasons to believe in God: change, cause and effect, why things exist, how good things are ranked, and how things fit together. He shows that God is the only thing that makes sense. If someone tells you you're missing a puzzle piece, you can figure out what it's like without actually seeing it.",
            "So, I'm going to tell you about this ancient dude named Buddha, who lived a gazillion years ago, somewhere around the 5th or 6th century BCE. He was a prince, but not just any prince – he was going to become the Buddha. Over time, he ditched the whole royal thing and got enlightened. His teachings ended up creating Buddhism, the most 'orthodox' sect of which is called Theravada Buddhism. This whole thing is over 2,500 years old now, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time. You can see this by looking at Sri Lanka, which is a Theravada nation, and their annual water-cutting ceremony. It's a big deal, with monks and regular folks participating, but Buddha never actually talked about anything like that. These changes go all the way from the surface-level stuff to the core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its rules and principles over time, whether it's due to external or internal factors, or even both. External factors are basically anything that comes from non-Buddhists, while internal factors are stuff that happens within the Buddhist community itself.\n\nThere are some terms that'll come up a lot in this discussion. Internal factors are basically things that come from within the Buddhist community, no matter if someone's a monk or not. External factors are anything that comes from outside the community. A hostile factor is anything that damages or tries to damage the community – basically, anything that has a negative view of Buddhism. A benign factor is something that doesn't want to hurt or help the community, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst off, we need to get a handle on the basics of Theravada Buddhism – the core principles that make it tick. Buddhists find refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Pali Canon, which includes the Tripitaka – the three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka is all about the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka is about the rules for monks and layfolk, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka is all about the metaphysical stuff, like no soul, inherent suffering, and the impermanence of everything. Understanding these ideas is key to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with that, you'll also be done with lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion when you get enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for living for both monks and layfolk. For regular folks, there are five precepts (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't get all crazy with sex, and don't get drunk). Monks have a lot more rules to follow. The fundamental idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and so on.",
            "You won't believe the epic rivalry that went down between the US and Mexico for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893.  It was like, a major thing (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145).  The rivalry was like, at its peak during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the US totally came at Mexico, kicked its butt, and took Texas and the Southwest as its own (I'm talking the US, not me, I wasn't born yet).  We're not the only ones, though - lots of countries with a history of clashes with their neighbors.  It's pretty common for countries that share borders to have major disagreements that fuel their rivalry (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  The US and Mexico were no exception - our rivalry started with some major disagreements over stuff like religion, culture, and tradition.  It's like, a big clash of interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  \n\nThis whole rivalry thing isn't unique to us, though.  Other countries that share borders often develop similar rivalries.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  Both of these countries are, like, right next to the US, and we've had a rivalry with them for a while.  Other countries in Latin America, though, have generally gotten along with us just fine.  \n\nReligion was a major point of contention between the US and Mexico, just like it has been in many other countries throughout history.  Sally Frahm (2001) said that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  It's kinda like how the Cold War was both an ideological struggle and a competition over interests, but with us, it was more about our differing views on religion.  We got these feelings of distrust from our colonial past with the English and Spanish, and that just made things worse (Diehl and Goerts 2000).  \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 major disputes between the US and Mexico during that 57-year rivalry period.  Most of those disputes were about territorial issues, like border raids from Mexico into the US and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a huge problem until we and Mexico both started cracking down on our borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).  Schmitt (1974) said that the rivalry started to die down as Mexico became more dependent on the US and our goals changed from expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110).",
            "I was hit with an unexpected illness fifteen years ago that left me in a state of disability that I had never anticipated. I was working as a nurse at the time and had chosen the profession to escape the uncertainty of my childhood. People kept telling me, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always need help.\" But my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist - maybe a little bit of both. Despite the doubts, I stuck with nursing.\n\nNow, I'm 46 and single, living on Social Security Disability after fifteen years. I've got nothing to show for it, and every day feels like a struggle to stay afloat. I'm still in a constant state of uncertainty, but one thing is clear - without the support of my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When disaster strikes, you realize how weak you are, not strong.\n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies, big and small, and no matter how prepared you are, some things are just too big to handle on your own. We need to stop putting all our faith in the government and learn to rely on each other instead. Trusting others and asking for help is a much better approach than building individual fallout shelters.\n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism\" that the Conservatives in the US love to talk about isn't what kept our ancestors going in hard times. It was actually compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources that got them through. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it alone - they worked together.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared and have your disaster kit ready. I've got mine set up with first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and lots of other essentials. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors and build a community that can support each other. It's a much better approach than going it alone.",
            "I've been wondering why organisms evolve the way they do and whether there are any limits that shape the direction of evolutionary change. Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said that it's almost impossible for biologists to put the fundamentals of organic forms into mathematical terms, and we're still not there yet. But lately, scientists have started using math to study the development of shell growth in mollusks, looking at both how they grow over their lifetime and how their ancestors evolved (think Raup and Stanley from 1981). Our research is trying to figure out how using math to model this growth, combined with actual experiments, can help us understand why and how certain traits develop during evolution. To do this, we took X-ray images of different species of Prunum and used them to identify factors that we could use to model different shell shapes. We plugged these factors into a special computer program called CerioShell (created by Stone in 1995) to see what different shapes might be possible. Then we combined these results with experiments and observations to better understand how big evolutionary changes happen in this group of animals.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that spins around in space, kind of like a 360-degree turn. These turns are called whorls, and they're like layers that spiral around an imaginary middle point, which is called the columella. The speed at which these layers grow can be different, and the lines that separate them are called sutures. In most shells, the biggest layer is the last one (the body whorl), and the spire is all the layers except that one. The pointy end is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nShells can be looked at in different ways, like from the top or bottom, or from the side. Most people look at shells with the hole facing them and the pointy end up.\n\nNow, let's talk about how to count the layers of a shell. First, you look at the top of the shell, and then you find the line where the first layer starts. Then you draw a line down the middle of the shell, and count the layers from there. You can even estimate layers that are almost complete.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can actually track the path of the hole by looking at the center of each layer and how big the hole is. This path can be shown as a graph or math problem. Once you have a math problem, you can change the variables and see how it affects the way the shell grows.",
            "The rate of newborn and infant deaths in Indonesia has pretty much stayed the same for the last ten years.  Even though they're making progress in some areas, like water and sanitation, they're missing the mark on reducing child and mom health problems.  I'm going to break down the reasons why, and it shows that Indonesia needs to focus on making their health system stronger instead of just having a bunch of programs.\n\nThey've made some improvements in getting health workers to be present at births, with 72% of births meeting this goal.  But let's not get too excited – it's not all good news.  This number includes traditional workers, like midwives, who can't help if things get complicated.  It's kind of like a puzzle, and some of the pieces are still missing.  Also, there's been a drop in the number of kids under five getting medical help for diarrhea.  And don't even get me started on post-natal care – it's a total concern, and the data isn't even complete.\n\nC-section rates are still way too low, around 4%.  And this number has its own problems too.  In cities, c-sections make up 7% of births, but in the countryside, it's only 2%.  This shows us that there's a big gap in healthcare access between cities and the country.  It's like having a health system with a big gap in the middle.\n\nAnother problem is that the rich have way more access to healthcare than the poor.  There's a 27% difference between the richest and poorest families.  It's pretty obvious that the poor are getting left behind because healthcare costs are just too high.  So, what's next?  How do we fix this?  The question is, should Indonesia focus on making one specific area better or strengthen their whole health system?  It seems like the latter would be the way to go, but there are some things to consider.\n\nHere's the thing: focusing on one area can be pretty tempting.  It's easy to see results, and it's a more manageable goal.  But there are some downsides.  If you put too much money into one area, the other areas are going to suffer.  And people will want to work in the area that's getting the most funding.  For example, think about what happened when they put a lot of money into dealing with HIV/AIDS – it hurt the family planning program.  Also, with all these programs running at the same time, it gets really confusing.  You end up with a lot of repetition and paperwork.  It's not the most efficient way to do things.",
            "Victorian novels are super detailed and super focused on the aristocracy, but not all of them are like that.  Two that stand out are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These books have mystery and weirdness in them, which helps readers understand the characters better. It's like you get to see inside their heads and figure out what they're thinking and feeling.\n\nI'm talking about the time I was walking with Sikes and Crackit, and we were yelling at each other.  It felt like the words we said were still echoing in my head, and when I tried to focus, I found myself talking to them.  Then there was this loud noise, like gunshots, and people were shouting and lights were flashing all around me.  I felt like I was being pulled away, but I couldn't control it.  There was this nagging feeling of pain that wouldn't go away – it was like someone was constantly poking at me.\n\nIn these two books, the authors use dreamlike scenes to show what's going on inside the characters' heads. In Oliver Twist, these visions often reveal stuff about Oliver's inner world, like what's bothering him and what he really thinks about what's happening. When Oliver gets shot, it's like he relives the whole thing in his head, over and over again.  He's trying to find help, but he's all numb and can't seem to do anything.  It's like his senses are all messed up, and he's stuck in this nightmare.  The whole thing is pretty overwhelming, and it makes you wonder who's really in control of Oliver's life – is it him, or is someone else calling the shots?  It's like he's given up, and that's not a good sign.\n\nThe next day was a blur – it felt like it came and went in an instant.  There was this endless, creepy silence, and then suddenly it was night again.  Night seemed to drag on and on, but at the same time, it felt like it was over before it even started.",
            "A couple years ago, I had a pretty cool experience working in an after-school program where I helped Elementary age students with their schoolwork. I tried my best to assist them with whatever subject they were struggling with, but my strengths were in English and reading. One kid in particular caught my attention – a little dude named Adrian, who was maybe in third or fourth grade. He was having some major trouble reading, but it wasn't because he didn't understand the words, it was because he didn't know the English alphabet all that well. At first, I thought something was really off, like he had some sort of learning disability or something, but it turned out he was just missing the basics. I remember his mom walking in during one of our sessions, and she didn't speak a word of English – only Spanish. We managed to communicate somehow, but it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, but he just needed help with the alphabet. I'm not sure if that epiphany helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story because it highlights the problem of language barriers in schools, especially out here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even for kids who speak perfect English, reading can still be super tough. Everyone agrees this is a problem, so the question is, what do we do? For Adrian, the solution was pretty simple: some extra help with English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. We've got dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and more – none of these things alone will fix the problem. The key is to combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is actually a great idea, not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. Studies have shown that kids in two-way bilingual programs do way better academically. A lot of people are scared of this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from them. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. What we can do is have special assistants, tutors, or whatever you call them, who are bilingual. That way, every kid can get the help they need to succeed.",
            "We've all been told from a young age that there's something greater than us out there - something we can't quite wrap our heads around. We're sent to church, temple, or search within ourselves for answers. Many of us stick with what our parents taught us, while others reject it completely, convinced that there's nothing beyond our own little world. We might experiment with different values, switching from one to another, trying to figure out who we are through our own unique spiritual perspectives. We're all on a quest to find a guiding light in the darkness and push through the shadows into the light.\n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain pelt the metal roof, when he told me his favourite bird was the cardinal. We both smoked our cigarettes in silence, surrounded by the sound of the rain pouring down through the gutters, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes lost in thought, his body frail and thin from months of sickness. His hair had thinned out too, and his clothes hung loosely on him. I felt a mix of emotions: fear, sadness, and a desperate urge to talk to him about how much I'd miss him, but I knew that would only make it more real. Instead, I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out at the rain-soaked sky.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but it was a cruel joke - what was the point of living longer when it was just more pain?

So I didn't. I couldn't bear to see the person who created me die. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he left this world. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to be there for his death. For three days, I curled up in a ball and waited for the news. But when it finally came, there was no phone call.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is basically an oxymoron, where 'old' and 'new' blend together, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This genre has been both slammed and praised, accused of lacking depth, and admired for its 'terrible sublime' aspect (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined the ideas of old romance and modern novels to create the proto-Gothic genre. It was a new way of expressing literary ideas. Walpole used a mix of old theatrical elements and the modern novel's naturalism to present his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre borrowed from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. When The Castle of Otranto came out, the term \"gothic\" was already associated with different people, styles, and time periods. It was seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to 'modern' societal and literary advancements. The blend of the theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format (which allowed readers to see the characters' psychology up close) helped the Gothic genre last and become both old and new to readers who were far away from the original writing.\n\nOne of the key gothic ideas in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, a knight's training process, is both kept and changed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight – brave, honorable, and capable – and the supposed lack of that ideal in society. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and used to try to improve the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of political turmoil, was disheartened about the future and thought that the supposed morality and 'goodness' in people present in the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This is clear in his character Frederic, who is described as a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is supposed to have been killed by infidels. The description of him includes many chivalric images, like being gallant and courteous. This exaggeration brings the Gothic trope of excess into play (66).",

It's like a big process of getting stuff from the customer's order all the way to the raw materials stage, then to supply, production, and finally to the customers. The term supply chain management was basically invented by Keith Oliver in 1982. He's a consultant and he described the whole process of planning, implementing, and controlling the chain to get stuff to customers super fast and efficiently. I mean, he made it sound so cool.\n\nSo there are six key things that make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six things to give customers the best service ever. It's like a big puzzle that they have to figure out.\n\nThe first step in the puzzle is production. It's like the foundation of the whole thing. Production tells you when, why, where, and how stuff gets made. Managers have to know what customers want, right? They can check out the market to figure out what customers are looking for. The market is like a big indicator of what customers are demanding. Once they know what customers want, they can decide what to make, how much to make, and where to make it. They have to think about the customer's demand and satisfaction, you know?\n\nFor example, if I worked at Wal-Mart or Target, they would have a super cool design book with steps for every little thing, from what employees wear to how to get shipments from trucks. Having all that planned out helps the company avoid confusion and run smoothly.\n\nThe second key thing in supply chain management is supply. It's like making strategic decisions about what your company can do and who you can partner with. You might have different divisions for different products, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers have to decide which division is best for each product. Sometimes, they might even outsource work to other companies to make things faster and cheaper.\n\nThat's basically it, folks. Supply chain management is all about getting stuff to customers efficiently and effectively.",
            "I saw a weird sign on the street today that said \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the Juno star, was holding that sign with a Sharpie, and it made me think of the country next to India, Myanmar, which is ruled by a super harsh military control group. They took over back in 1962. There were these big protests in 2007, the Saffron Revolution, where thousands of monks marched in the streets. The monks wore these bright orange robes, and it was a big deal. At first, the government was cool with them protesting, but things escalated quickly, and the monks and the military were fighting like crazy. The military even broke into some of the monasteries and arrested journalists who were just trying to report on the whole thing. A Japanese journalist got killed just for being there. The government says 13 people died, but another soldier who defected said way more people died, like thousands. It's not like this is a new thing, though. Governments have been trying to suppress people for as long as we've had societies. Even the ancient Romans thought their emperors were gods. The Japanese emperor is considered a god too, and some people think he brought us cell phones and cool ways to kill yourself. Even our current president talks to some dude named Ted Haggard who leads a group called the Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nI was thinking about all the times when people tried to stand up to their governments and got crushed. Like that one time in China in 1989 when students and intellectuals protested and the government killed a bunch of them. We still don't know exactly how many died, but it was way more than what the government said. There was that other time in Rwanda in the 90s when the government helped kill all these people just because they were from a different group. And then there's the whole Hitler thing – he rounded up all these people just because of what they believed. It's just crazy.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is basically due to the fact that he was around for a long time and was super creative. This means he got to shape his orchestra in all sorts of ways. When you listen to a lot of his music, you might not notice him playing piano, but as a composer, he was totally awesome at making complex pieces that featured each musician's special talents. Ellington created the perfect setting for a soloist to improvise, and at the same time, he wrote music that was really tight and had certain sections with specific styles that fit the band members. He basically helped the whole orchestra sound like one coherent unit, creating unique sounds for each song. By understanding how each musician sounded separately and how they fit together, Ellington could write some of the most innovative music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's style and innovation, and mentions Creole Love Call as an example of him using voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This is like, an early example of Ellington's ability to mix voice with other sounds without words getting in the way. Creole Love Call also shows how Ellington could make the style of his soloists shine. This slow twelve bar blues piece has six choruses, which are kinda like the different parts of the song. Here's what each one's like:\n\nChorus 1: It's like a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice starts smooth and then gets all rough at the end.\nChorus 2: There's a muted trumpet solo that takes the main melody and adds some extra blue notes.\nChorus 3: It's a really high clarinet solo with a piano phrase that's kinda syncopated.\nChorus 4: The whole band repeats the first chorus, but this time it's like a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: This is the climactic part of the song, where the reeds start doing the call and response in a high register and the brass and rhythm sections are doing their own thing.\nChorus 6: It's back to the first chorus, but now the voice is doing this \"growl\" thing and soloing like an instrument.\nTag: There's a little tag at the end with a vocal run and some crazy notes from a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a new dimension to his music is just one example of how he did things his own way and influenced a lot of other musicians. In Hot and Bothered, he uses his skills at making music sound really tight and his ear for tone color to create a really cool sound. In It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to make the melody on muted trombone sound really cool.",
            "It was this gnawing feeling that she'd had for years. It started when she hit 14 and entered the whirlwind of being a teenager. Even three years later, at 17, it was still there, driving her to think that she needed something more. But it wasn't a thing - it was a person. Yet, none of the guys she met seemed to be the one. Some had tried to swoop in, making awkward attempts to win her over, but nothing clicked. She'd often ask herself what was going on, wondering what it was that made a teenage girl feel this way. Years of pondering had brought up a bunch of theories, but none stuck.\n\nHer home life was usually pretty chill. Her parents were good people, always calm and laid-back. They rarely fought, and when they did, it was usually about her desire for independence and her free-spirited nature. She was their calm daughter, but in a weird way, their opposing energies made her stand out - she was fun, outgoing, and nice.\n\nToday, though, was a different story. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard her mom's voice, laced with panic, coming from the kitchen. She ran in to find her mom on the ground, wincing in pain, saying \"Ow\" over and over. Her daughter rushed to her side, putting a hand on her to help, and asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mom managed to stammer out, \"Ouch...sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter sprang into action, helping her mom to the car and driving her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a place of disinfectant and fear, but she was too worried about her mom to feel it. She rushed her to the doctors, who quickly took her mom to get checked out. Her daughter was left pacing, worried sick. It turned out her mom had fallen off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to show that sticking to the Mediterranean Diet, known as the \"aMed diet\", helps cut down on the risk of heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a special version of the traditional Mediterranean diet and is all about eating more plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less animal products and fats. \n\nPrevious studies had already found that people who follow the Mediterranean diet are less likely to die from heart problems, and another study proved that it's even better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering bad cholesterol levels in obese people. However, these studies didn't look at the impact of the diet on stroke specifically.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 female nurses, aged 38 to 63, who were already participating in a big research project called the Nurses' Health Study. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated how well each nurse followed the aMed diet by asking them about their eating habits in surveys every six years. Almost all of the nurses kept participating for the whole 20 years. The researchers also checked the nurses' medical records to see if they had heart problems or strokes and made sure that the information was accurate. \n\nTo get a better picture of the nurses' eating habits over time, the researchers averaged out their aMed diet scores from their surveys over the years. They also adjusted for things that could affect the results, such as the nurses' age, weight, smoking habits, and exercise routine.\n\nUsing special math, the researchers found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet closely had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke. After 20 years, they found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 heart disease deaths. The women who followed the diet the best were less likely to get heart disease and stroke compared to those who followed it the least.",
            "It's crazy to think that like, 15 years ago, the United States went through a major financial crisis. People lost their jobs, houses were becoming worthless, and huge corporations were on the verge of collapse. So, the question remains: how did this all go down, and how can we avoid it happening again? The whole thing started with some pretty silly and not-so-smart political decisions that basically forced banks to give out bad loans to people who couldn't afford them. At the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being pressured into buying up these bad mortgages and turning them into even more complicated financial messes. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were left in a tough spot and just shifted the blame to the people who bought those bad mortgages from them.\n\nIt all started to unravel back in the late 90s, when President Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He relaxed some rules, hoping to make himself look good, and that's when things started to go downhill. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote, \"Fannie Mae was under a lot of pressure from the government to give out more loans to people who can barely afford them, and from stockholders to keep making money.\" He basically predicted that this would all end badly: \"This government-subsidized company might get into trouble when the economy slows down, and we might need to bail them out like we did with the savings and loan industry back in the 80s.\" \n\nA bunch of other factors contributed to the whole mess, like the crazy new types of mortgages people were getting, such as adjustable-rate mortgages and CDOs. This just made things way more complicated and connected to the housing market. It was like, people and banks got in way over their heads, and when the housing bubble burst, they were all like, \"What do we do now?\" The top five investment banks in the US had like, $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which was a third of the country's GDP. In the end, some of these banks got sold super cheap, others got shut down, and Fannie and Freddie were basically taken over by the government because they were so deep in debt.",
            "Exposition - that infamous section in your story where you spread your wings as a writer but end up putting most of your readers to sleep or making them hit the \"Back\" button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her monitor when she gets stuck in the land of Too Much Information, and for good reason. Exposition is not your BFF (best friend forever).\n\nYou probably know the drill: \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin still finds herself rambling on with unnecessary backstory, or worse, dragging readers through a boring forest of details. Exposition is that pesky voice in your head that says, \"Get the history over with so we can get to the good stuff.\" Just don't confuse it with the other voice that's all like, \"Tell us everything about the main character's mom's cat.\"\n\nSo, what is exposition, exactly? It's when you tell your readers what happened instead of showing them. Think about it like a film where one character is dumping a huge load of info on another character, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, you're the one doing the dumping.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine you're reading a story and it goes something like this: \"The heroine met her husband at such and such a time, and they got married in a big way, but he ended up getting murdered in front of her. Yeah, that's it.\" You wouldn't expect a two-page explanation of the whole thing, with only two lines of dialogue from the couple. That's just boring. What you'd want is to see how much the husband loves his wife through the way he talks and acts, and how her life changes with him. If the story later says they had a deep connection, you'd want to see evidence of that in the story itself. You'd get to experience the husband's death with the heroine and become more connected to her character.\n\nSo, as a writer, you need to add some meat to the bare bones of the storyline. It's tempting to rush through certain parts, but don't - take the time to develop your characters and make them real. You might know that your character used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station at night, and dreams of owning the place one day, but do you really need to tell us all that at once? Keep it simple and let your readers experience it through the story itself.",
            "Today I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), and guess what? It was a live show! The leading story was about a sick guy in Ashley, Ohio who stabbed his wife - they didn't say her name, just his, Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and let me tell you, he looked like a total creep. They only gave it two minutes, which I thought was fair since the story was still developing. The details they did give were pretty basic - he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting involving an 18-year-old kid named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He got shot and was in critical condition, but no arrests had been made, and there were no suspects yet. The SWAT Team was investigating, which seemed a little weird considering there wasn't much info on the case. I've noticed this before: minorities get glossed over when they're victims of a crime. For some reason, if it's a white person who gets hurt or kidnapped, the media goes crazy, but if it's a minority, it's like they're not even important. \n\nNext up was a story about a gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter. They gave some details about where they think the incident happened and what kind of bullet was used (a .22 caliber from a rifle). They're offering a five-thousand dollar reward for anyone who can give 'em a lead on the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms that were supposed to hit on Saturday afternoon. They said the temps would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but that was about it - I guess they wanted to leave us hanging so we'd keep watching.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said the thief was a black guy wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, about six-foot-tall and 150 pounds. They made a big deal about how dark-skinned he was, which seemed kinda weird.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, some dude who got convicted of smuggling a bunch of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. He got sentenced to 300 months in prison (which I guess means 25 years, but I'm not really sure why they said it that way). They also mentioned he's Hispanic, which I don't think was really necessary.",
            "There's a deep, unbreakable connection between brothers that's hard to put into words. This bond is made up of a mix of feelings, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have this unique understanding of each other that's hard to find with anyone else. They can see themselves through their brother's eyes, and it's only when things get really tough that the true nature of this bond shows up – whether it's good or bad. However, it comes at a cost, and part of understanding this bond means dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see your own reflection staring back, and it's a look at yourself, not as others see you, but as you really are.  In the long run, it's the choices you make and the consequences that follow that show your true character.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is really brought out through the two brothers' crazy, intense emotions. They're on this wild, impossible journey, and in the end, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a super dramatic moment. Only one of them makes it out alive. The author uses the protagonist's character and how he interacts with his brother, as well as the narrator's point of view, to show just how complicated these feelings can be. The whole story is centered around one main emotion: pride. From the very start, the protagonist feels really resentful towards his little brother, Doodle. He wanted a brother who could do all the cool stuff he was good at, like holding his breath or climbing trees. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, and it was clear he'd never be able to do those things. The protagonist's whole world was crushed when he realized his dreams were gone. In fact, he even thought about hurting his little brother at one point, which is pretty shocking. But when Doodle smiles, it makes the protagonist's heart melt. It shows that deep down, he really loved his brother and didn't want to hurt him. This whole thing is a wild ride, and it's amazing how easy it is to get caught up in your own emotions and forget what's most important.",
            "The brain is like a super cool, super complicated info machine that's been around for a long time. Over time, people have used all sorts of cool metaphors to describe it. They first compared it to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now to a computer. But keep in mind that these metaphors aren't perfect and can lead to some pretty wild conclusions.\n\nSo here's how it works: your senses like eyes, ears, and skin take in the physical stuff around you, like touch, heat, sound, or light. They turn that into a secret language that the brain can understand. This information gets processed over and over again in two ways: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box, your brain puts together simple stuff like color, shape, and where the edges are to figure out that it's a box. Then, it uses what it's already learned to help you recognize the box even faster. It's like when you look at a picture of a pizza and your brain is like, \"Oh, it's a circle with cheese and sauce!\"\n\nOnce the brain's processed the info to some extent, it decides how important it is and which other brain processes it should get to look at it. For instance, you might be walking through the park and your brain is processing every single blade of grass, but it only lets you notice the really important stuff, like the person talking to you. There are a lot of stages of processing, and the brain's like, \"Hey, I think this is cool, let me take a closer look!\" or \"Nope, this isn't that important, move on!\"\n\nFor the brain to process info, it needs to store it first. There are different kinds of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term. First, it gets encoded, which is like putting a code on it. There are different types of encoding for different kinds of sensory stuff. For example, if you read a word, it gets encoded based on how it looks, what it sounds like, or what it means. Once it's stored, it needs to be kept safe. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which lasts for about 20 seconds, is like a temporary electrical signal that keeps going for a little while. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are a bunch of different models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, like the way people remember stuff, how computers work, or how our brains are wired. The semantic network model says that there are like nodes that represent ideas, and they're connected based on how related they are. For example, the idea of a chair might be linked to a table, which is linked to wood, and so on.",
            "It's like Aldous Huxley was totally worried about how technology and capitalism were becoming super threatening in the novel Brave New World. He imagined a future where people would actually be more into being part of a community than being individuals. They'd be brainwashed from birth to go for immediate happiness over everything else. It's like these people were just pawns in some giant game, forced to stick to one way of thinking by the World Controller. If you look at the book through the lens of Marxist ideas, you can tell Huxley was really skeptical about the whole system. He used a lot of terms from Marxism, like how people become the same and stuff gets turned into objects, to show how he thought the capitalist system was messed up.\n\nHe also used satire to make fun of capitalism by saying that people are tricked into not knowing the real deal about the classes in society. It's like, the common people only care about their own stuff, and they don't really get how things work. This is because the people in charge are controlling what they think and want. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, just go along with it because they're conditioned to want to buy and spend and indulge. It's all manipulated by the World Controller, who's like the ultimate puppet master.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that the lower classes are being dominated by the upper classes. They're like, completely clueless about the system, just 'buying into' an idea that keeps them in their place. Even the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, just go along with it. They're not really doing anything to change things. The way the different classes interact with each other is a big clue about how capitalism is oppressing people.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are super shallow. The characters are basically just one-dimensional. It's like Huxley is saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and creativity. Love and strong emotions don't exist; people just talk about how good-looking someone is, or how great their experiences are. Each class is just happy with their place in society, which is a big sign of how capitalism is affecting people. They're just obeying the rules and doing what they're told, like the Marxist idea of the proletariat being tricked into thinking they're better than everyone else if they just consume and follow the rules.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now - or four and a half semesters if you count the semesters. It's a big campus, and getting around can be a real drag. Last year I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is pretty far out there, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Going from my Stuart Hall home to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially if it's raining or something. I talked to an alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not long ago, East Halls was basically a separate part of campus, surrounded by empty space. Now that's all filled up with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? On a college campus, I think the best answer is the humble bike. But it's not just about having a bike - people actually have to ride them, and the campus needs to be bike-friendly.\n\nI was talking to a friend who got back into biking after a few years off, and he was saying how he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Plus, biking is great for your body, and it's super efficient. I can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride my bike 30 miles or more. I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Getting a bike was one of the smartest things I did this year. I have class in Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with a bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The problem is, Pollock Road is the shortest route to Thomas, but it's not always easy to ride on. I also like biking because I'm too busy to walk, and walking would take up way too much of my time. If I didn't have my bike, I'd have to walk to Thomas every day, which would take an extra 30-40 minutes. That's over two and a half hours every week, and I just don't have that kind of time to waste."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.

I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm planning to go into social work and eventually land a job with the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to help out kids who've been through a tough time and offer support to their families. Some values that I think are super important for my career are service, respect, and being ethical - I want to make sure I'm helping people and relationships in the best way possible, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills so I can be the best social worker I can be. These aren't just principles that I think are cool for social workers - they're also really important to me personally.\n\nI've always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure what career path to take. In high school and college, I saw a lot of people dodging their problems or using not-so-great coping mechanisms. After seeing so many people dealing with tough stuff, I decided to study Psychology in college. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still unsure about what to do next. One summer day, I visited a friend and met a 16-year-old kid who was really stressed out. He was trying to escape his abusive parents, and it was pretty eye-opening for me. The next day, I found out he'd called the cops on his parents. I drove over to their place and told the police about my concerns and my degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I asked them about the situation, they seemed really nervous and tried to make excuses for their son's behavior. That experience made me think seriously about going into social work to help kids deal with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is another important value for me in the social work field. We say that every individual matters, but I think people just say that because it sounds good - we tend to follow old ways of thinking rather than being truly unique. That's why I'm not into trying to fit in with everyone else. I've always stood up for what I believe in: coloring my hair weird colors, wearing clothes that show my personality, getting piercings, joining GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I see it. I'm all about social justice and I'm going to keep speaking out against things that aren't right.",
            "This paper examines the intersection of biological and sociocultural models in understanding the sleep disorder, insomnia. The biological model delves into the genetic factors and medical aspects that contribute to the condition, while the sociocultural model explores environmental influences, demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Below is an overview of the research related to each model and how they shed light on the complexities of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health issues, and sleep problems caused by medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, involve difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder, are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep. Insomnia specifically refers to a persistent difficulty in sleeping.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders zeroes in on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects that influence sleep patterns. Research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, as crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study found that mice lacking phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons exhibited disrupted sleep-wake cycles. Activating the GABAA receptor enhanced sleep, while inhibiting it reduced anxiety and induced sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This study implies that a genetic or environmental issue with this receptor could affect a person's ability to sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study suggest that inherited traits could regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor might naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life and tasks that require focus and concentration.",

Next, diagnosis is explained, including the key signs or \"red flags\" that point to the condition. Finally, the paper wraps up with ways that a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, is a condition where the brain can't quite process the sounds we hear, even though we can hear them just fine. So it's not like we're hearing-impaired, but more like our brain has trouble sorting out what we're hearing - like separating words from background noise. This disorder is also known as (C)AP, which refers to the way our central nervous system (CNS) handles auditory information and the brain activity that goes along with it.\n\nCAPD first showed up in research back in the 1950s under the name \"auditory imperception\". It started to gain some attention in the 1950s, when researchers were looking into kids with communication disorders, and the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests to help identify these kids. In the 1960s, Kimura came up with a way to test this condition using a technique called dichotic testing, and came up with a model to explain how the brain works when it comes to hearing sounds.\n\nPeople with CAPD might have a range of problems - they might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from, or distinguishing between different sounds, or even recognizing patterns in sounds. They might struggle to pick up on changes in voice or tone, or have trouble making sense of sound clues. They might even have trouble figuring out the order of sounds. \n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, you need to get a closer look at how they process sound. This can involve observing their listening behavior and testing their auditory skills with a range of tools and techniques, including questionnaires and surveys, and even recording the sounds inside their ears to see how their brain responds. There isn't one single test that's foolproof, and there's no known cause for the condition. Some tests present a bunch of sounds at once and ask the person to pick out specific sounds, while more advanced tests measure how their brain responds to different sounds.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that when you pretend to be someone else for a long time, it can be super helpful in fooling people, but at the end of the day, you've got to let go of that disguise or risk losing yourself completely. The thing is, giving up a deception can be tough because it might make you feel really disconnected from the people around you. So, you're basically stuck with a choice between being true to yourself or keeping your relationships intact. Some people might just shrug it off when they find out they've been tricked, but others will not be so cool about it and might even get really upset about the whole thing.\n\nDeception can be especially tricky when it comes to switching up your gender, because it raises a lot of questions. Like, why would someone feel the need to hide who they really are and pretend to be the opposite gender? In Twelfth Night, Viola's got a pretty obvious reason - she wants to protect herself from people who might try to hurt her. She says, \"I'll take you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) She's saying she needs to pretend to be a man to stay safe.\n\nBut here's the thing, pretending to be a man makes Viola feel cut off from the women around her, and she even gets confused with her twin brother Sebastian, which makes things way more complicated. Olivia starts falling for Cesario (Viola in disguise), and Viola's also got feelings for Orsino, but she's too scared to express them. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261) It's pretty wild to think that Twelfth Night might be showing how pretending to be someone else can help you figure out your real feelings, like what's going on with Olivia and Orsino.\n\nOne thing that's pretty interesting is that Shakespeare might be using Olivia as a commentary on how people judge others based on how they look. I mean, Olivia is really attracted to Cesario at first, but then she totally switches gears and starts seeing Cesario as family instead of a love interest. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) It's like Shakespeare is saying that people might be attracted to things that don't make sense, or that they might be using disguise to explore their own feelings.",
            "People have been talking about how brutal German colonial rule was, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. But it's way more complicated than just saying that - the German colonial empire was super varied in terms of policies and ruling styles, just like the different places it was in. Even education systems across the colonies were pretty different. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that there were tons of educated and literate Africans living there. The Germans had actually done a pretty good job of educating people in some of their other colonies, like Kamerun, if you can believe it. \n\nBut South West Africa (where Namibia is now) was like a whole different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government was involved in educating the locals, in South West Africa, the job was pretty much left to missionary groups that got hardly any help from the government. Although the government did invest in educating Europeans living in the colony, setting up schools and stuff, and also kind of regulating the missionary schools. These education policies had some pretty long-lasting effects in South West Africa, even after the Germans lost control. While other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans, in South West Africa, most people were still pretty much uneducated and illiterate. There were a bunch of different reasons for this, and my paper is going to try to figure out what they were, especially by looking at new research about how the settlers and colonial officials felt about the native Africans.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of books and articles about education in the German colonies out there, but most of them are in German and were written during or right after the time of German colonial rule. Most of them just describe what the education systems were like in the different colonies, but later ones did more detailed studies and comparisons. One of the most important ones is a study by Cohen that compares education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen thinks that the big difference between the two is because South West Africa had a lot of settlers, which affected how the colony was run.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as harsh in terms of climate as some of the other German colonies, but it was still pretty dry, especially in some areas. As a result, the European population there was bigger than in some of the other colonies - by 1913 there were almost 15,000 whites living there, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next biggest settler population, East Africa.",
            "It's hard to list all the different kinds of popular music because the classification has gotten way more complicated over the past 100 years. The thing is, a lot of genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have spawned even more sub and sub-sub genres. Heavy metal rock, which is one of the more diverse and expressive genres, has gotten really crazy in the past 40 years. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly on the darker side, but that's what makes it so unique. People started experimenting with it early on and created their own sub-genres, which led to even more sub-sub-genres. Now it's gotten to the point where it's hard to figure out what heavy metal even is.\n\nBut to understand the metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta know where it came from and why it's a movement, not just a genre. Heavy metal is all about being dark - it's like the 'music of more' with more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more drama. Metal bands are all about being skilled musicians and it shows in their music. Plus, a lot of metal is influenced by psychedelia - a big drug boom in the 70s led to people making crazy music that was out of this world. It's all about the dark, raw emotions that people were feeling, which was new to the music scene back then. Later metal bands even took inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark vibes. Check out these lyrics from Helter Skelter - it's like a wild ride of emotions, almost like a rollercoaster of feelings. Some people even consider it one of the first heavy metal songs ever, and it was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was already on the heavier side. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they added that song to The White Album.",
            "A whole bunch of years before these Surrealist dudes started painting their trippy masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was secretly painting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a painting from 1910, is like a symbol of this, showing a woman who's totally amazed by the awesome things she sees in her dream world. But it's also super personal, representing Rousseau's own hopes and dreams as an artist - he wanted to be famous, have people like his artwork, and be accepted by other artists and art enthusiasts. But here's the thing: he was stuck with a major internal conflict - should he try to be like everyone else and paint like they do, or be true to himself and do his own thing? The Dream is basically Rousseau's artistic struggle in a nutshell: to play it safe and be accepted by the art world, or to be unique and forge his own path.\n\nTo really get what's going on in The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. This guy was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France called Laval. His dad was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who had a pretty comfy life, but Rousseau didn't have any art training - he just worked a regular job until he was 40, and then started painting as a way to cope with the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight kids. After that, he had one kid left, Julia, and was totally heartbroken. He hoped painting would give him a fresh start. Unlike other artists of his time who made a big deal about painting peasants and stuff, Rousseau was more of a folk painter, just making art like regular people do.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition is pretty understandable when you think about it: he was basically a self-taught painter who started way later in life, and was working at the same time as all these other famous artists. It's like, he finally got some respect for his art around the same time that Matisse was starting to become a big deal. According to Jan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were like total opposites - Matisse hated painting boring stuff, while Rousseau just wanted to make something so normal that everyone would like it and accept him as a real artist.",
            "Lots of smart people have said that ethics and beauty are connected, that truth and beauty are basically the same thing. I think there's a reason for this deep connection. As John Keats said in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we know in life comes from school or experience, but we seem to get into ethics and aesthetics in our own way, like Keats said. Both ethics and aesthetics are like trying to describe what makes something beautiful or right, rather than giving a list of rules to follow. We're always talking about why a painting or a book is good, but we can't quite put our finger on it. When someone asks what you like about a favorite work of art or literature, it's usually something like, \"There's just something about it\" before they try to explain it in more detail. I think that art and morals can't be fully explained - they're like something that's too deep to be described. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how hard you try to describe a work of literature, there's still something special about it that can't be captured. I think ethics is the same way. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think that this \"something\" that's hard to put into words is what makes art and morality so powerful, and that's what connects them.\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because they both touch us at a deep, almost unknowable level. We can feel it, but we can't quite explain it. This connection is even stronger with literature. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a powerhouse today, a single country with a unique mix of cultures. From the shadow of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, you can feel the same vibe. It's the same culture that runs through Köln on the Rhine River, right through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Considering all this, it's no big surprise that Germany, as we know it now, is made up of different parts from various tribes. \n\nThe roots of Germany, or Germania, are a topic of heated debate among scholars and historians. One of the most famous theories is that the name comes from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that lived before they crossed the Rhine and fought against the Gauls. However, this is disputed, and some people think the name might have come from a neighborly term in the Gaulish language. Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and fought against tribes that crossed the Rhine often with unclear motives. He might have taken this word from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes that he hadn't conquered yet. \n\nIn his first chapter of the first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine and were constantly at war with the Gauls, fighting almost daily battles. Others think the name Germany might come from the spear called a \"ger\" used in warfare or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud and noisy. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were originally from the region and hadn't mixed with other cultures at all. He thought it was crazy that anyone would leave their home in Asia or Africa for Italy and then move to Germany, with its harsh environment, rough weather, and tough people, unless it was their true home. \n\nIt was the same with the Romans. They would conquer the lands of Germania for resources and occasionally lead a land campaign, but they mostly just returned home to their empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills with the Romans by serving in their army.",
            "I stood there staring blankly in front of me, my mind completely numb to the scene in front of me.  It was like I was a robot, just going through the motions, studying the picture without really thinking about it.  Thoughts kept popping into my head and then quickly disappearing, like they were just passing through.  I felt like I was just along for the ride, not really in control of my own thoughts.\n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was six years old.  So, when an artist friend suggested I get a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, I jumped at the chance.  It's like a tutorial on how to use your brain to draw, teaching you stuff like what a pencil is and how your brain interprets lines.  One of the cool things it teaches is to draw a square frame around the picture you're looking at, so it's not overwhelming.  Like, take a picture of a bunch of fruit on a table in a kitchen - it's just too much to take in.  But with a frame, it's like, just a picture of that fruit on a plain background.\n\nBut at that moment, staring at the fruit in front of me, I couldn't even think about drawing a frame.  I was just in awe, completely blown away by what I was seeing.  I felt like I was a real artist, like I was on the verge of creating something amazing.  I was thinking about all the great artists who came before me, people like Picasso and Monet - they all had their own styles and colors.  If I was going to be an artist, I wanted to be known for something too, so I started thinking about my own style, my own vision.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for my pencil, my muscles tensed up and then relaxed as I gripped it tightly.  I was ready to create something amazing, to bring my vision to life.  But then my mind went blank again, and all I could think about was the toilet.  Specifically, the brown mess that someone had left in it.  I tried to flush it away, but it just wouldn't budge.  I stood there, frowning, staring at the mess, feeling like a total failure.  I gripped the mop tightly, ready to tackle the mess, but my hand just sort of hung there, like it was waiting for instructions.  I finally managed to muster up the energy to grab the toilet paper and start mopping up the mess, but it was a total struggle.  I felt like I was in a trance, just going through the motions, not really thinking about what I was doing.  It was like I was a robot, just programmed to clean up after other people.",
            "A lot of teenagers are driving into trouble and accidents behind the wheel.  There are a bunch of factors at play here.  One reason is that teenagers' brains just aren't ready for the dangers of driving yet.  Plus, they're super inexperienced, which leads not only to more fatal crashes but also more vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  And things get even worse when they're driving with their friends - which, let's be real, is pretty much all the time.  Researchers found that the older the passengers in the car, the more accidents happen. \nSome states, like California, have tried to make driving safer for teens by giving them limited driver's licenses that restrict how long they can drive and who can ride with them.  But honestly, these temporary licenses are just band-aids on a bigger issue.  The problem is that as a group, teenagers are just not capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license.  He's found that a lot of people under 19-20 love taking risks just for the thrill of it, and it makes sense to wait until that urge dies down a bit before letting them drive.  If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing fatal crashes and the death toll will be huge.  By 2010, a huge number of new teen drivers will be hitting the road, and it's going to be a disaster.  \nSo, what to do?  We could keep teaching driver's ed in schools to get them started, but no one under 18 should be able to drive.  A provisional permit could still be issued beforehand, and they'd need a certain number of practice hours with a licensed driver.  We should just make this a national rule so it's the same everywhere.  It's not a new idea, but it's a good one.",
            "I spent the day in the Library of Congress's archive of old Edison films and watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and they were all pretty clever. These films use editing tricks to create illusions, and my project was to study their poetics and see how they evolved over time. At first glance, these trick films seem pretty straightforward: they're set in a single room, rarely use camera movement, and stick to one shot per film. But, if you look closer, some of the later films start to break the rules by experimenting with multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that really stands out about these films is that they're all shot in front of a stationary camera, which never moves to follow the action. This style was super common back then and came from the theater, vaudeville, and magic shows. The problem with filming in a static setting is that characters can only move side to side – they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Take the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) for example. The actors come in from the side and just kind of mill around in place.\n\nSince the camera doesn't move, most shots in these films are long shots or medium shots. You almost never see close-ups, which was influenced by the theater and vaudeville traditions where the whole performance was visible at once, framed by the edges of the stage. Actors in these early films never move towards the camera, so close-ups just aren't an option.\n\nMost of these trick films follow a one-shot-per-film rule, which limits them to just a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also means they're mostly just short, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and switching acts with minimal story. However, it's worth noting that what looks like one shot to the viewer can actually be several shots joined together to create an illusion. If you look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), you can see where the physical shots start and stop, even though it's all one shot in your mind.",
            "So, you wanna know about John Taylor of Caroline, right? Well, he was a total die-hard Republican back in the day. This guy was all about farming and politics, which made him super outspoken about personal freedom and government stuff. He was all about preserving and promoting agriculture, and that's basically how he thought about everything, including the government. He wanted to keep it simple and fair, you know? He believed that a farm was the best career, and that's how he built his whole philosophy on government and the Constitution.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a chance to create the ultimate system without being held back by old customs, so he was all about self-government and doing things the right way. He believed in the natural rights of people, like freedom and stuff, and he thought they were all connected - if one was taken away, they'd all suffer. He wanted those rights to be totally off-limits to the government. He thought the \"state of nature\" was all about the strong and mean taking advantage, but in civilization, that shouldn't be how it goes down.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought a government should be built with both good and bad in mind. He was super strict about his ideas on good and evil, and he said that a government's virtues and flaws are basically human too. He thought good principles should be about protecting people's property, improving farming, and not being too capitalist, and that a government with good principles would work out okay no matter who's in charge, even if they're all about personal gain. But, he believed that self-interest is basically human nature, and it's only bad when it's all about taking from others. A good government is needed to keep people's bad sides in check, but it's gotta be watched closely so it doesn't get worse.\n\nTaylor was like a lot of other Republicans back then - he wanted the Constitution to be taken super literally, with the government only having the powers it was given. He thought a big government is expensive and might be a dictatorship, but he also didn't want it to be too simple or literal, 'cause that could lead to problems. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was the real deal, 'cause it said the US was a bunch of states, not just one country.",
            "Looking back at the data in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. It was pretty discouraging and it's hard to figure out why this happened. One possible reason could be the onset of winter at our New England campus, which usually leads to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Also, with the end of the fall semester, people are super busy with schoolwork, grades, and other stuff, so it's easy to forget about the commuter log. Plus, December is the start of the holiday season and everyone's on break, which means fewer people need to come to campus. It wasn't until the spring semester picked up again in late January that things started to look up. However, the low number of submissions in February still didn't make sense. I wondered if it's just that any project like this has a burst of energy at the beginning that eventually fades away. To combat this, we tried the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which actually worked and got people excited again. It was tough to keep the project going, especially with the holiday and semester breaks that always come up in college. \n\nAnother challenge for this project (and probably any other commuting project) is that people really love the freedom, independence, and flexibility that comes with driving their own cars. This is just how our culture is. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we need to offer some pretty sweet incentives. So, we gave out gift cards to all sorts of places like restaurants, coffee shops, and even a local bookstore. It would've been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, would've affected participation. Maybe it could've even helped us get back on track after that dip in engagement. One thing that didn't change throughout the project was the kind of prizes we offered. If we had announced some bigger prizes in the middle of the project, like a bike in December and a hybrid car in January, it might've made people more excited to participate. The gift cards were cool at first, but who wouldn't be even more stoked if they knew they could win a sick new set of wheels?",
            "I recently learned about exchange traded funds, or ETFs for short. These securities are super flexible and offer the benefits of owning individual stocks, like being able to sell short or buy on margin, but they also give you the diversification of an index fund. Plus, the expense ratios of ETFs are way lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, like the commission fees you pay on each trade, just like when you're buying or selling a stock. Another cool thing about ETFs is the huge variety of funds available, but it's always a good idea for smart investors to check if the benefits they're promised really live up to their hype. For this project, we're going to take a closer look at the ETF IHF and see how its top 10 holdings stack up against owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. We're only looking at the top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets, since going over every single holding would be a bit too much. Here's what we found:\n\nTo get a better sense of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can calculate the contributions of each stock to its Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF holds them. Check out the chart below to see the results.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a return that's 6.11% higher than the ETF IHF, which is a pretty sweet 16% boost. What's more, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's, which could be a good thing. But before we get too excited, we need to make sure these results aren't just a fluke. To do that, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare it to the ETF IHF's standard deviation. Stay tuned to see what we find out!",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is widely considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's best poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" which, according to Mabbott, has its roots in Virgil's work. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world in Greek mythology. But what's more interesting is that Poe was heavily influenced by German authors, and one in particular - Gothe. Poe's familiarity with Gothe's writing is evident in his use of \"Thulé\". \n\nThis connection is reinforced by Karl J. Arndt's observation in his book on Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, which notes the striking similarities between the two poems, suggesting that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature also highlights Gothe's notable works, including the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts, first in 1808 and then in 1832, the year of Gothe's passing. Within Faust, there's a poem called \"The King of Thulé\" that tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. The king then becomes a heavy drinker, mourning his lost love. He eventually decides it's his time to die and passes on his possessions, save for the goblet, and throws it into the ocean before taking his own life. The similarities between the King of Thulé and the character in \"Dream-Land\" are uncanny, and some might see it as a darker reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction. Interestingly, Faust was later adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". \n\nPoe references \"ultrama Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", but in \"Dream-Land\", he uses \"Thule\" as a bookend, framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" echoing the themes of loss, loneliness, and a desolate landscape found in \"The King of Thulé\". The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes Thule as a dark, lonely place haunted by the ghosts of dead friends, a world devoid of color. This mirrors the King of Thulé's experience after losing his wife, and it's as if Poe is stepping into Goethe's poem. Given Poe's respect for Tennyson, it's likely he would have been familiar with Goethe's work, and the many reproductions of his works that were being published at the time further solidified Poe's connection to Goethe's writing.",
            "So, I'm wondering if a person could get punitive damages in court if they got hurt in a grocery store after slipping on an applesauce spill because the manager was super careless. He knew there was a mess, but he didn't bother to clean it up for over half an hour because he was eating dinner. He'd been told about the spill not once, but twice. A judge wouldn't just dismiss the person's claim for punitive damages. To get those damages, the person would have to show that the manager did something super bad on purpose, like ignoring the harm it could cause. They'd also have to prove that the manager's actions were really bad and showed a huge disregard for how his actions could affect others. In this case, the person could argue that the manager should have known that not cleaning up the spill would hurt someone, especially since multiple people slipped on the same thing in the months leading up to the accident. The manager still didn't take action, even after knowing this. The person's argument that the manager's actions were really bad is kinda weak, but it's still a valid point since there were six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager still didn't do anything to keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee told the manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in the store. Martin said he was eating dinner and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee told him again, but he still didn't do anything. At 5:30 pm, the person who got hurt, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got seriously hurt. Before that, there were five other slip-and-fall incidents in the same store in 2009. Now Palmer is suing the store for both compensation and punitive damages, and we're looking at whether to file a motion to get the punitive damage claim thrown out.\n\nIn California, a person can get punitive damages if the other person did something super mean, like being really cruel or lying to them. The law says that's when someone acts on purpose to hurt someone, or when they don't intend to hurt someone, but they do something really bad and show a huge disregard for other people's safety. The court has said that's when someone knows their actions could cause harm and they still do it anyway.",
            "It's crazy how a class I took almost four years ago in Islam at CBC still has me thinking about this topic.  The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion was a huge deal back then, and I think it's more relevant now than ever.  Since 9/11, I've noticed that mass media has gone from being really negative about Islam and extremists to being super tolerant of it in America - it's like a total 180.  In 2001, I don't think a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his obvious Muslim background, would've even been a possibility.\n\nI'm actually pretty fascinated by the biography of the Prophet Muhammad.  What I learned about him seems to contradict the personality people usually think of when they hear his name.  I thought he was some kind of conqueror who forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a totally different picture - Muhammad as a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  It's like people came to see the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out one by one. \n\nIt's wild how similar some of his 'miracles' are to those of Jesus - like when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed a huge crowd.  The way it's written makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but just lived in truth and did miracles.  To me, this is a major problem because it downplays the life and miracles of Jesus.  It's like they're trying to take credit for Jesus' life by portraying Muhammad as a similar figure.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that seem like they're trying to show how people came to Islam on their own, but most of them are third-hand accounts.  I'm not a fan of this because it makes the stories seem suspicious and takes away from their impact.  I think their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, but it actually does the opposite.\n\nWhat really gets me is how the biography tries to make Muhammad out to be this awesome, godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle.  But history says otherwise - Muhammad was a pretty powerful guy who rose to power in a way that doesn't exactly scream 'gentle'.  I wonder if Muslims today know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and values that Jesus had during his lifetime were pretty much left behind in the development of Christianity after he passed away.  If we look at the history of Christianity, it's like watching a ship drift further and further away from its original course. It's clear that today, more and more people are starting to wake up and realize that they've been sailing in the wrong direction. While some traditional folks will stick to what they've been taught, they might not be enough to steer the whole crew back on track. A growing number of people will become more aware of their history and start to crave a return to the original intentions of Jesus and his teachings. It might take a while – decades or even centuries – but it's inevitable that eventually, there will be a major shift. The tide of Christian history will start moving in reverse, stripping away the extra baggage that's accumulated over time, and getting back to the basics. It'll be like rewinding a tape, until all that's left is a clear picture of what Jesus actually preached about. \n\nThis movement will sweep across countries like the US and Europe, influencing millions and bringing people back to the essentials of Jesus' teachings. The church, as an institution, will still be strong enough to lead the way. But as a result of this shift, the diverse and complex landscape of Christianity will simplify into more uniformity. Instead of seeing a million different interpretations and practices, we'll see more and more similarities across the board. Human history's full of these kinds of reversals – think of how Christians used to be persecuted by the Roman Empire, but later it became a Christian institution. We've seen how our country moved from slavery to equality for African-Americans. This big reversal that's coming in the future will happen within Christianity, and it'll be a journey back to the source, leaving diversity behind. A key part of this process will be learning to interpret Jesus' words in a metaphorical way, rather than taking them literally. So, what happened to Jesus' teachings over time?\n\nLooking way back into history, we find that the only thing before Christianity was Judaism. The core of this faith included monotheism, the idea of a divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 BCE, the Jewish people weren't a single, unified group. They were divided into different factions, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "I think that The Jungle really shows us what people are like deep down inside - we're all pretty greedy and self-centered. We only want to make our own lives as good as possible and look out for ourselves, but we don't really care about anyone else. The Jungle shows this in a lot of ways, but one of the most obvious is with the bosses of the big factories. All they care about is making their companies super successful and getting as much money as possible. They don't care if anyone gets hurt or if anything gets in their way. Upton Sinclair's writing, like when he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky\", really paints a picture of all the damage that's being done. He's showing how the bosses don't care about anyone or anything that might get hurt by their factories - the pollution, the animal waste, none of it matters to them.\n\nThe bosses also didn't care about their employees, who were working super hard to make them rich. They'd do whatever it took to make a little extra money, and they didn't care who got hurt in the process, \"So it was like one big pot of jealousy and hatred; nobody had any loyalty or decency, and nobody was worth anything more than a dollar\". They made their employees work super long hours and then fired them randomly without any help or notice. Back when The Jungle was written, there weren't really any laws to protect workers, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. The people who worked and lived in Packingtown were basically expected to just deal with the terrible conditions - nobody was there to help them. There were some unions, but they mostly just made money off the workers. The workers were treated like slaves, and that's basically what they were - they were stuck in a system with no way out, and they were described as being as miserable as people were under slavery.",
            "Authors often use various techniques to shape the mood or attitude of their readers towards significant topics. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He sometimes pairs words that normally don't go together to create a distinct atmosphere around an object or subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, and then uses it to evoke a certain feeling. Fitzgerald frequently uses this second technique with colors, particularly gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops the meanings of white/gray and then uses them to create a particular impression of a significant object.\n\nFitzgerald builds up the meaning of white/gray by repeatedly using them in the novel. He associates white with being fancy and high-class, with gray being more dull and faded. Fitzgerald introduces this association early on, showing how characters like Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\" (8). Everyone at parties is wearing white, from Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) to Tom's \"white shirt\" (36). Even the environment is described as having a uniform appearance: the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40) when Nick isn't at a party. To reinforce this association, Fitzgerald describes ordinary, insignificant things with these colors: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and people's names are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. He even uses these colors to describe plain or common people and places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26).\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. He starts by applying this technique to Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), making her seem less like a character and more like an accessory Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique more extensively around Daisy to give her an impression of being a uniform addition, for instance, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she's again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a goldmine for agricultural production thanks to its awesome weather. They grow a lot of stuff there like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. It's super in-demand to buy organic food directly from local farmers in the area, with so many people waiting in line to get their hands on it. People are also super into getting their eggs and milk from organic farms. Some of these farms even let people come and explore their operations, and you can go hiking, birdwatching, or just chill there. It's like a win-win situation for the landowner, 'cause they get to get some cash and also help out the environment. This is especially cool 'cause it lets them qualify for government programs that'll help 'em out.\n\nNot only does organic farming bring in some cash, it also makes the area way more diverse in terms of plants and animals. Without all the chemicals, the soil and water are basically a party for all the little critters. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - organic farming can be more expensive in some ways. For example, it takes a lot more work to get rid of pests and weeds, and you gotta put in extra effort to fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Plus, you might end up losing more stuff than you would with regular farming methods. And, if you're a small farm, you're at a disadvantage 'cause big farms are way more efficient. There are other things you can do to help the environment that aren't even about organic farming, like planting special crops to keep pests away, rotating your animals to keep the land healthy, and getting rid of invasive species. All these things can be a real time suck, though.\n\nFor this example, I chose a piece of land in the East County Southern Foothills of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. It's a 160-acre chunk of chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. They're still working on the plan, but it's got over a hundred different plants and animals on the list, some of which are super endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are in danger of becoming endangered, like the burrowing owl. This land has been home to Native Americans for who-knows-how-long and was later settled by cattle ranchers and people who sold cordwood back in the 1800s. It was part of an original homestead, so it was probably used for grazing and making wood for a long time.\n\nI picked a real estate listing and looked up what government programs are out there to help small farmers save cash and keep their operations eco-friendly. To get an idea of what it's like, I looked at an actual organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. You can figure out a lot about a culture by looking at what it's not, rather than what it actually is. This culture thing isn't one big, uniform thing - it's super diverse and can change depending on the situation. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are way too broad and oversimplify things. It's way more helpful to understand what a culture means in this specific situation and how that culture might affect the conversation. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you're gonna relate to it in your own way, and comparisons are gonna pop up.\n\nIt can take some work to grasp another culture or mindset - you might have to study its history, or try to understand its prejudices. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, just accept it for what it is and work with it. This is especially true in negotiations, especially if you're in a weaker position. If you're \"on the road\" and need to navigate a different culture, showing respect for their traditions and values can actually help you get past any cultural barriers and move the conversation forward.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture isn't just about where you come from or where you're going - it can be something as small as a company's corporate culture. For example, some companies are super strict about working hours, while others are way more relaxed. You can see this in employee dress codes, the way people communicate, and even how they hire people. Take American corporate culture - it's totally different from company to company (and even within companies, it can vary from region to region). Some cultures seem super uniform, but that just means you gotta dig deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important because it helps you understand why a culture does things a certain way. If saving face or keeping things harmonious is a big deal in a culture, you won't see anyone publicly embarrassing themselves or their boss to get ahead. On the other hand, if a culture values getting a tough deal, they won't be in a rush to settle. Knowing these kinds of things can really help before you get to the negotiation table. But you should also try to learn a bit about your opponent as an individual to make the negotiations go smoothly.",
            "There's this famous Bible verse - \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" - and it's found in Psalm 14. St. Anselm used this quote to start his argument for the existence of God. It's also believed by another big thinker, Thomas Aquinas. Since both of them are trying to prove the same idea, we'll just assume they're both right, because if we use a different idea of God, it'd be hard to compare their arguments. If we do that, it's like comparing apples and oranges. Let's just say they both believe in the Christian God for simplicity's sake. Now, I think both of them have some good points, but neither of them really gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He says that we can understand God by looking inside ourselves. He thinks that because we can't really imagine a world without God, that means God must be real. This idea is really like looking at what we already know inside our minds and using that to figure out the truth about God. St. Anselm says we don't need any other proof, that our own understanding is enough. This way of thinking is often called faith in Christian texts. It's like trusting something even if we can't prove it.\n\nThis is different from how Thomas Aquinas thinks. He says that we can prove God exists using logic and things we can see, not just faith. This would be super helpful for spreading the word about Christianity because people wouldn't have to believe it just because someone told them to. They could use their brains to figure it out. St. Thomas presents five different logical reasons to believe in God: change, cause and effect, why things exist, how good things are ranked, and how things fit together. He shows that God is the only thing that makes sense. If someone tells you you're missing a puzzle piece, you can figure out what it's like without actually seeing it.",
            "So, I'm going to tell you about this ancient dude named Buddha, who lived a gazillion years ago, somewhere around the 5th or 6th century BCE. He was a prince, but not just any prince – he was going to become the Buddha. Over time, he ditched the whole royal thing and got enlightened. His teachings ended up creating Buddhism, the most 'orthodox' sect of which is called Theravada Buddhism. This whole thing is over 2,500 years old now, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time. You can see this by looking at Sri Lanka, which is a Theravada nation, and their annual water-cutting ceremony. It's a big deal, with monks and regular folks participating, but Buddha never actually talked about anything like that. These changes go all the way from the surface-level stuff to the core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its rules and principles over time, whether it's due to external or internal factors, or even both. External factors are basically anything that comes from non-Buddhists, while internal factors are stuff that happens within the Buddhist community itself.\n\nThere are some terms that'll come up a lot in this discussion. Internal factors are basically things that come from within the Buddhist community, no matter if someone's a monk or not. External factors are anything that comes from outside the community. A hostile factor is anything that damages or tries to damage the community – basically, anything that has a negative view of Buddhism. A benign factor is something that doesn't want to hurt or help the community, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst off, we need to get a handle on the basics of Theravada Buddhism – the core principles that make it tick. Buddhists find refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Pali Canon, which includes the Tripitaka – the three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka is all about the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka is about the rules for monks and layfolk, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka is all about the metaphysical stuff, like no soul, inherent suffering, and the impermanence of everything. Understanding these ideas is key to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with that, you'll also be done with lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion when you get enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for living for both monks and layfolk. For regular folks, there are five precepts (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't get all crazy with sex, and don't get drunk). Monks have a lot more rules to follow. The fundamental idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and so on.",
            "You won't believe the epic rivalry that went down between the US and Mexico for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893.  It was like, a major thing (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145).  The rivalry was like, at its peak during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the US totally came at Mexico, kicked its butt, and took Texas and the Southwest as its own (I'm talking the US, not me, I wasn't born yet).  We're not the only ones, though - lots of countries with a history of clashes with their neighbors.  It's pretty common for countries that share borders to have major disagreements that fuel their rivalry (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  The US and Mexico were no exception - our rivalry started with some major disagreements over stuff like religion, culture, and tradition.  It's like, a big clash of interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  \n\nThis whole rivalry thing isn't unique to us, though.  Other countries that share borders often develop similar rivalries.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  Both of these countries are, like, right next to the US, and we've had a rivalry with them for a while.  Other countries in Latin America, though, have generally gotten along with us just fine.  \n\nReligion was a major point of contention between the US and Mexico, just like it has been in many other countries throughout history.  Sally Frahm (2001) said that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  It's kinda like how the Cold War was both an ideological struggle and a competition over interests, but with us, it was more about our differing views on religion.  We got these feelings of distrust from our colonial past with the English and Spanish, and that just made things worse (Diehl and Goerts 2000).  \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 major disputes between the US and Mexico during that 57-year rivalry period.  Most of those disputes were about territorial issues, like border raids from Mexico into the US and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a huge problem until we and Mexico both started cracking down on our borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).  Schmitt (1974) said that the rivalry started to die down as Mexico became more dependent on the US and our goals changed from expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110).",
            "I was hit with an unexpected illness fifteen years ago that left me in a state of disability that I had never anticipated. I was working as a nurse at the time and had chosen the profession to escape the uncertainty of my childhood. People kept telling me, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always need help.\" But my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist - maybe a little bit of both. Despite the doubts, I stuck with nursing.\n\nNow, I'm 46 and single, living on Social Security Disability after fifteen years. I've got nothing to show for it, and every day feels like a struggle to stay afloat. I'm still in a constant state of uncertainty, but one thing is clear - without the support of my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When disaster strikes, you realize how weak you are, not strong.\n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies, big and small, and no matter how prepared you are, some things are just too big to handle on your own. We need to stop putting all our faith in the government and learn to rely on each other instead. Trusting others and asking for help is a much better approach than building individual fallout shelters.\n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism\" that the Conservatives in the US love to talk about isn't what kept our ancestors going in hard times. It was actually compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources that got them through. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it alone - they worked together.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared and have your disaster kit ready. I've got mine set up with first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and lots of other essentials. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors and build a community that can support each other. It's a much better approach than going it alone.",
            "I've been wondering why organisms evolve the way they do and whether there are any limits that shape the direction of evolutionary change. Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said that it's almost impossible for biologists to put the fundamentals of organic forms into mathematical terms, and we're still not there yet. But lately, scientists have started using math to study the development of shell growth in mollusks, looking at both how they grow over their lifetime and how their ancestors evolved (think Raup and Stanley from 1981). Our research is trying to figure out how using math to model this growth, combined with actual experiments, can help us understand why and how certain traits develop during evolution. To do this, we took X-ray images of different species of Prunum and used them to identify factors that we could use to model different shell shapes. We plugged these factors into a special computer program called CerioShell (created by Stone in 1995) to see what different shapes might be possible. Then we combined these results with experiments and observations to better understand how big evolutionary changes happen in this group of animals.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that spins around in space, kind of like a 360-degree turn. These turns are called whorls, and they're like layers that spiral around an imaginary middle point, which is called the columella. The speed at which these layers grow can be different, and the lines that separate them are called sutures. In most shells, the biggest layer is the last one (the body whorl), and the spire is all the layers except that one. The pointy end is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nShells can be looked at in different ways, like from the top or bottom, or from the side. Most people look at shells with the hole facing them and the pointy end up.\n\nNow, let's talk about how to count the layers of a shell. First, you look at the top of the shell, and then you find the line where the first layer starts. Then you draw a line down the middle of the shell, and count the layers from there. You can even estimate layers that are almost complete.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can actually track the path of the hole by looking at the center of each layer and how big the hole is. This path can be shown as a graph or math problem. Once you have a math problem, you can change the variables and see how it affects the way the shell grows.",
            "The rate of newborn and infant deaths in Indonesia has pretty much stayed the same for the last ten years.  Even though they're making progress in some areas, like water and sanitation, they're missing the mark on reducing child and mom health problems.  I'm going to break down the reasons why, and it shows that Indonesia needs to focus on making their health system stronger instead of just having a bunch of programs.\n\nThey've made some improvements in getting health workers to be present at births, with 72% of births meeting this goal.  But let's not get too excited – it's not all good news.  This number includes traditional workers, like midwives, who can't help if things get complicated.  It's kind of like a puzzle, and some of the pieces are still missing.  Also, there's been a drop in the number of kids under five getting medical help for diarrhea.  And don't even get me started on post-natal care – it's a total concern, and the data isn't even complete.\n\nC-section rates are still way too low, around 4%.  And this number has its own problems too.  In cities, c-sections make up 7% of births, but in the countryside, it's only 2%.  This shows us that there's a big gap in healthcare access between cities and the country.  It's like having a health system with a big gap in the middle.\n\nAnother problem is that the rich have way more access to healthcare than the poor.  There's a 27% difference between the richest and poorest families.  It's pretty obvious that the poor are getting left behind because healthcare costs are just too high.  So, what's next?  How do we fix this?  The question is, should Indonesia focus on making one specific area better or strengthen their whole health system?  It seems like the latter would be the way to go, but there are some things to consider.\n\nHere's the thing: focusing on one area can be pretty tempting.  It's easy to see results, and it's a more manageable goal.  But there are some downsides.  If you put too much money into one area, the other areas are going to suffer.  And people will want to work in the area that's getting the most funding.  For example, think about what happened when they put a lot of money into dealing with HIV/AIDS – it hurt the family planning program.  Also, with all these programs running at the same time, it gets really confusing.  You end up with a lot of repetition and paperwork.  It's not the most efficient way to do things.",
            "Victorian novels are super detailed and super focused on the aristocracy, but not all of them are like that.  Two that stand out are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These books have mystery and weirdness in them, which helps readers understand the characters better. It's like you get to see inside their heads and figure out what they're thinking and feeling.\n\nI'm talking about the time I was walking with Sikes and Crackit, and we were yelling at each other.  It felt like the words we said were still echoing in my head, and when I tried to focus, I found myself talking to them.  Then there was this loud noise, like gunshots, and people were shouting and lights were flashing all around me.  I felt like I was being pulled away, but I couldn't control it.  There was this nagging feeling of pain that wouldn't go away – it was like someone was constantly poking at me.\n\nIn these two books, the authors use dreamlike scenes to show what's going on inside the characters' heads. In Oliver Twist, these visions often reveal stuff about Oliver's inner world, like what's bothering him and what he really thinks about what's happening. When Oliver gets shot, it's like he relives the whole thing in his head, over and over again.  He's trying to find help, but he's all numb and can't seem to do anything.  It's like his senses are all messed up, and he's stuck in this nightmare.  The whole thing is pretty overwhelming, and it makes you wonder who's really in control of Oliver's life – is it him, or is someone else calling the shots?  It's like he's given up, and that's not a good sign.\n\nThe next day was a blur – it felt like it came and went in an instant.  There was this endless, creepy silence, and then suddenly it was night again.  Night seemed to drag on and on, but at the same time, it felt like it was over before it even started.",
            "A couple years ago, I had a pretty cool experience working in an after-school program where I helped Elementary age students with their schoolwork. I tried my best to assist them with whatever subject they were struggling with, but my strengths were in English and reading. One kid in particular caught my attention – a little dude named Adrian, who was maybe in third or fourth grade. He was having some major trouble reading, but it wasn't because he didn't understand the words, it was because he didn't know the English alphabet all that well. At first, I thought something was really off, like he had some sort of learning disability or something, but it turned out he was just missing the basics. I remember his mom walking in during one of our sessions, and she didn't speak a word of English – only Spanish. We managed to communicate somehow, but it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, but he just needed help with the alphabet. I'm not sure if that epiphany helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story because it highlights the problem of language barriers in schools, especially out here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even for kids who speak perfect English, reading can still be super tough. Everyone agrees this is a problem, so the question is, what do we do? For Adrian, the solution was pretty simple: some extra help with English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. We've got dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and more – none of these things alone will fix the problem. The key is to combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is actually a great idea, not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. Studies have shown that kids in two-way bilingual programs do way better academically. A lot of people are scared of this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from them. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. What we can do is have special assistants, tutors, or whatever you call them, who are bilingual. That way, every kid can get the help they need to succeed.",
            "We've all been told from a young age that there's something greater than us out there - something we can't quite wrap our heads around. We're sent to church, temple, or search within ourselves for answers. Many of us stick with what our parents taught us, while others reject it completely, convinced that there's nothing beyond our own little world. We might experiment with different values, switching from one to another, trying to figure out who we are through our own unique spiritual perspectives. We're all on a quest to find a guiding light in the darkness and push through the shadows into the light.\n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain pelt the metal roof, when he told me his favourite bird was the cardinal. We both smoked our cigarettes in silence, surrounded by the sound of the rain pouring down through the gutters, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes lost in thought, his body frail and thin from months of sickness. His hair had thinned out too, and his clothes hung loosely on him. I felt a mix of emotions: fear, sadness, and a desperate urge to talk to him about how much I'd miss him, but I knew that would only make it more real. Instead, I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out at the rain-soaked sky.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but it was a cruel joke - what was the point of living longer when it was just more pain? I'd stopped believing in God a long time ago, and I didn't bother with prayers that night. If he existed, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch my dad slip away. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to see the person who created me die. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he left this world. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to be there for his death. For three days, I curled up in a ball and waited for the news. But when it finally came, there was no phone call.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is basically an oxymoron, where 'old' and 'new' blend together, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This genre has been both slammed and praised, accused of lacking depth, and admired for its 'terrible sublime' aspect (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined the ideas of old romance and modern novels to create the proto-Gothic genre. It was a new way of expressing literary ideas. Walpole used a mix of old theatrical elements and the modern novel's naturalism to present his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre borrowed from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. When The Castle of Otranto came out, the term \"gothic\" was already associated with different people, styles, and time periods. It was seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to 'modern' societal and literary advancements. The blend of the theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format (which allowed readers to see the characters' psychology up close) helped the Gothic genre last and become both old and new to readers who were far away from the original writing.\n\nOne of the key gothic ideas in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, a knight's training process, is both kept and changed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight – brave, honorable, and capable – and the supposed lack of that ideal in society. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and used to try to improve the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of political turmoil, was disheartened about the future and thought that the supposed morality and 'goodness' in people present in the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This is clear in his character Frederic, who is described as a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is supposed to have been killed by infidels. The description of him includes many chivalric images, like being gallant and courteous. This exaggeration brings the Gothic trope of excess into play (66).",
            "So I'm gonna tell you about supply chain management. It's like a big process of getting stuff from the customer's order all the way to the raw materials stage, then to supply, production, and finally to the customers. The term supply chain management was basically invented by Keith Oliver in 1982. He's a consultant and he described the whole process of planning, implementing, and controlling the chain to get stuff to customers super fast and efficiently. I mean, he made it sound so cool.\n\nSo there are six key things that make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six things to give customers the best service ever. It's like a big puzzle that they have to figure out.\n\nThe first step in the puzzle is production. It's like the foundation of the whole thing. Production tells you when, why, where, and how stuff gets made. Managers have to know what customers want, right? They can check out the market to figure out what customers are looking for. The market is like a big indicator of what customers are demanding. Once they know what customers want, they can decide what to make, how much to make, and where to make it. They have to think about the customer's demand and satisfaction, you know?\n\nFor example, if I worked at Wal-Mart or Target, they would have a super cool design book with steps for every little thing, from what employees wear to how to get shipments from trucks. Having all that planned out helps the company avoid confusion and run smoothly.\n\nThe second key thing in supply chain management is supply. It's like making strategic decisions about what your company can do and who you can partner with. You might have different divisions for different products, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers have to decide which division is best for each product. Sometimes, they might even outsource work to other companies to make things faster and cheaper.\n\nThat's basically it, folks. Supply chain management is all about getting stuff to customers efficiently and effectively.",
            "I saw a weird sign on the street today that said \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the Juno star, was holding that sign with a Sharpie, and it made me think of the country next to India, Myanmar, which is ruled by a super harsh military control group. They took over back in 1962. There were these big protests in 2007, the Saffron Revolution, where thousands of monks marched in the streets. The monks wore these bright orange robes, and it was a big deal. At first, the government was cool with them protesting, but things escalated quickly, and the monks and the military were fighting like crazy. The military even broke into some of the monasteries and arrested journalists who were just trying to report on the whole thing. A Japanese journalist got killed just for being there. The government says 13 people died, but another soldier who defected said way more people died, like thousands. It's not like this is a new thing, though. Governments have been trying to suppress people for as long as we've had societies. Even the ancient Romans thought their emperors were gods. The Japanese emperor is considered a god too, and some people think he brought us cell phones and cool ways to kill yourself. Even our current president talks to some dude named Ted Haggard who leads a group called the Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nI was thinking about all the times when people tried to stand up to their governments and got crushed. Like that one time in China in 1989 when students and intellectuals protested and the government killed a bunch of them. We still don't know exactly how many died, but it was way more than what the government said. There was that other time in Rwanda in the 90s when the government helped kill all these people just because they were from a different group. And then there's the whole Hitler thing – he rounded up all these people just because of what they believed. It's just crazy.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is basically due to the fact that he was around for a long time and was super creative. This means he got to shape his orchestra in all sorts of ways. When you listen to a lot of his music, you might not notice him playing piano, but as a composer, he was totally awesome at making complex pieces that featured each musician's special talents. Ellington created the perfect setting for a soloist to improvise, and at the same time, he wrote music that was really tight and had certain sections with specific styles that fit the band members. He basically helped the whole orchestra sound like one coherent unit, creating unique sounds for each song. By understanding how each musician sounded separately and how they fit together, Ellington could write some of the most innovative music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's style and innovation, and mentions Creole Love Call as an example of him using voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This is like, an early example of Ellington's ability to mix voice with other sounds without words getting in the way. Creole Love Call also shows how Ellington could make the style of his soloists shine. This slow twelve bar blues piece has six choruses, which are kinda like the different parts of the song. Here's what each one's like:\n\nChorus 1: It's like a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice starts smooth and then gets all rough at the end.\nChorus 2: There's a muted trumpet solo that takes the main melody and adds some extra blue notes.\nChorus 3: It's a really high clarinet solo with a piano phrase that's kinda syncopated.\nChorus 4: The whole band repeats the first chorus, but this time it's like a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: This is the climactic part of the song, where the reeds start doing the call and response in a high register and the brass and rhythm sections are doing their own thing.\nChorus 6: It's back to the first chorus, but now the voice is doing this \"growl\" thing and soloing like an instrument.\nTag: There's a little tag at the end with a vocal run and some crazy notes from a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a new dimension to his music is just one example of how he did things his own way and influenced a lot of other musicians. In Hot and Bothered, he uses his skills at making music sound really tight and his ear for tone color to create a really cool sound. In It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to make the melody on muted trombone sound really cool.",
            "It was this gnawing feeling that she'd had for years. It started when she hit 14 and entered the whirlwind of being a teenager. Even three years later, at 17, it was still there, driving her to think that she needed something more. But it wasn't a thing - it was a person. Yet, none of the guys she met seemed to be the one. Some had tried to swoop in, making awkward attempts to win her over, but nothing clicked. She'd often ask herself what was going on, wondering what it was that made a teenage girl feel this way. Years of pondering had brought up a bunch of theories, but none stuck.\n\nHer home life was usually pretty chill. Her parents were good people, always calm and laid-back. They rarely fought, and when they did, it was usually about her desire for independence and her free-spirited nature. She was their calm daughter, but in a weird way, their opposing energies made her stand out - she was fun, outgoing, and nice.\n\nToday, though, was a different story. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard her mom's voice, laced with panic, coming from the kitchen. She ran in to find her mom on the ground, wincing in pain, saying \"Ow\" over and over. Her daughter rushed to her side, putting a hand on her to help, and asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mom managed to stammer out, \"Ouch...sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter sprang into action, helping her mom to the car and driving her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a place of disinfectant and fear, but she was too worried about her mom to feel it. She rushed her to the doctors, who quickly took her mom to get checked out. Her daughter was left pacing, worried sick. It turned out her mom had fallen off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to show that sticking to the Mediterranean Diet, known as the \"aMed diet\", helps cut down on the risk of heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a special version of the traditional Mediterranean diet and is all about eating more plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less animal products and fats. \n\nPrevious studies had already found that people who follow the Mediterranean diet are less likely to die from heart problems, and another study proved that it's even better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering bad cholesterol levels in obese people. However, these studies didn't look at the impact of the diet on stroke specifically.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 female nurses, aged 38 to 63, who were already participating in a big research project called the Nurses' Health Study. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated how well each nurse followed the aMed diet by asking them about their eating habits in surveys every six years. Almost all of the nurses kept participating for the whole 20 years. The researchers also checked the nurses' medical records to see if they had heart problems or strokes and made sure that the information was accurate. \n\nTo get a better picture of the nurses' eating habits over time, the researchers averaged out their aMed diet scores from their surveys over the years. They also adjusted for things that could affect the results, such as the nurses' age, weight, smoking habits, and exercise routine.\n\nUsing special math, the researchers found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet closely had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke. After 20 years, they found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 heart disease deaths. The women who followed the diet the best were less likely to get heart disease and stroke compared to those who followed it the least.",
            "It's crazy to think that like, 15 years ago, the United States went through a major financial crisis. People lost their jobs, houses were becoming worthless, and huge corporations were on the verge of collapse. So, the question remains: how did this all go down, and how can we avoid it happening again? The whole thing started with some pretty silly and not-so-smart political decisions that basically forced banks to give out bad loans to people who couldn't afford them. At the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being pressured into buying up these bad mortgages and turning them into even more complicated financial messes. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were left in a tough spot and just shifted the blame to the people who bought those bad mortgages from them.\n\nIt all started to unravel back in the late 90s, when President Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He relaxed some rules, hoping to make himself look good, and that's when things started to go downhill. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote, \"Fannie Mae was under a lot of pressure from the government to give out more loans to people who can barely afford them, and from stockholders to keep making money.\" He basically predicted that this would all end badly: \"This government-subsidized company might get into trouble when the economy slows down, and we might need to bail them out like we did with the savings and loan industry back in the 80s.\" \n\nA bunch of other factors contributed to the whole mess, like the crazy new types of mortgages people were getting, such as adjustable-rate mortgages and CDOs. This just made things way more complicated and connected to the housing market. It was like, people and banks got in way over their heads, and when the housing bubble burst, they were all like, \"What do we do now?\" The top five investment banks in the US had like, $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which was a third of the country's GDP. In the end, some of these banks got sold super cheap, others got shut down, and Fannie and Freddie were basically taken over by the government because they were so deep in debt.",
            "Exposition - that infamous section in your story where you spread your wings as a writer but end up putting most of your readers to sleep or making them hit the \"Back\" button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her monitor when she gets stuck in the land of Too Much Information, and for good reason. Exposition is not your BFF (best friend forever).\n\nYou probably know the drill: \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin still finds herself rambling on with unnecessary backstory, or worse, dragging readers through a boring forest of details. Exposition is that pesky voice in your head that says, \"Get the history over with so we can get to the good stuff.\" Just don't confuse it with the other voice that's all like, \"Tell us everything about the main character's mom's cat.\"\n\nSo, what is exposition, exactly? It's when you tell your readers what happened instead of showing them. Think about it like a film where one character is dumping a huge load of info on another character, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, you're the one doing the dumping.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine you're reading a story and it goes something like this: \"The heroine met her husband at such and such a time, and they got married in a big way, but he ended up getting murdered in front of her. Yeah, that's it.\" You wouldn't expect a two-page explanation of the whole thing, with only two lines of dialogue from the couple. That's just boring. What you'd want is to see how much the husband loves his wife through the way he talks and acts, and how her life changes with him. If the story later says they had a deep connection, you'd want to see evidence of that in the story itself. You'd get to experience the husband's death with the heroine and become more connected to her character.\n\nSo, as a writer, you need to add some meat to the bare bones of the storyline. It's tempting to rush through certain parts, but don't - take the time to develop your characters and make them real. You might know that your character used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station at night, and dreams of owning the place one day, but do you really need to tell us all that at once? Keep it simple and let your readers experience it through the story itself.",
            "Today I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), and guess what? It was a live show! The leading story was about a sick guy in Ashley, Ohio who stabbed his wife - they didn't say her name, just his, Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and let me tell you, he looked like a total creep. They only gave it two minutes, which I thought was fair since the story was still developing. The details they did give were pretty basic - he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting involving an 18-year-old kid named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He got shot and was in critical condition, but no arrests had been made, and there were no suspects yet. The SWAT Team was investigating, which seemed a little weird considering there wasn't much info on the case. I've noticed this before: minorities get glossed over when they're victims of a crime. For some reason, if it's a white person who gets hurt or kidnapped, the media goes crazy, but if it's a minority, it's like they're not even important. \n\nNext up was a story about a gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter. They gave some details about where they think the incident happened and what kind of bullet was used (a .22 caliber from a rifle). They're offering a five-thousand dollar reward for anyone who can give 'em a lead on the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms that were supposed to hit on Saturday afternoon. They said the temps would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but that was about it - I guess they wanted to leave us hanging so we'd keep watching.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said the thief was a black guy wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, about six-foot-tall and 150 pounds. They made a big deal about how dark-skinned he was, which seemed kinda weird.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, some dude who got convicted of smuggling a bunch of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. He got sentenced to 300 months in prison (which I guess means 25 years, but I'm not really sure why they said it that way). They also mentioned he's Hispanic, which I don't think was really necessary.",
            "There's a deep, unbreakable connection between brothers that's hard to put into words. This bond is made up of a mix of feelings, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have this unique understanding of each other that's hard to find with anyone else. They can see themselves through their brother's eyes, and it's only when things get really tough that the true nature of this bond shows up – whether it's good or bad. However, it comes at a cost, and part of understanding this bond means dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see your own reflection staring back, and it's a look at yourself, not as others see you, but as you really are.  In the long run, it's the choices you make and the consequences that follow that show your true character.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is really brought out through the two brothers' crazy, intense emotions. They're on this wild, impossible journey, and in the end, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a super dramatic moment. Only one of them makes it out alive. The author uses the protagonist's character and how he interacts with his brother, as well as the narrator's point of view, to show just how complicated these feelings can be. The whole story is centered around one main emotion: pride. From the very start, the protagonist feels really resentful towards his little brother, Doodle. He wanted a brother who could do all the cool stuff he was good at, like holding his breath or climbing trees. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, and it was clear he'd never be able to do those things. The protagonist's whole world was crushed when he realized his dreams were gone. In fact, he even thought about hurting his little brother at one point, which is pretty shocking. But when Doodle smiles, it makes the protagonist's heart melt. It shows that deep down, he really loved his brother and didn't want to hurt him. This whole thing is a wild ride, and it's amazing how easy it is to get caught up in your own emotions and forget what's most important.",
            "The brain is like a super cool, super complicated info machine that's been around for a long time. Over time, people have used all sorts of cool metaphors to describe it. They first compared it to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now to a computer. But keep in mind that these metaphors aren't perfect and can lead to some pretty wild conclusions.\n\nSo here's how it works: your senses like eyes, ears, and skin take in the physical stuff around you, like touch, heat, sound, or light. They turn that into a secret language that the brain can understand. This information gets processed over and over again in two ways: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box, your brain puts together simple stuff like color, shape, and where the edges are to figure out that it's a box. Then, it uses what it's already learned to help you recognize the box even faster. It's like when you look at a picture of a pizza and your brain is like, \"Oh, it's a circle with cheese and sauce!\"\n\nOnce the brain's processed the info to some extent, it decides how important it is and which other brain processes it should get to look at it. For instance, you might be walking through the park and your brain is processing every single blade of grass, but it only lets you notice the really important stuff, like the person talking to you. There are a lot of stages of processing, and the brain's like, \"Hey, I think this is cool, let me take a closer look!\" or \"Nope, this isn't that important, move on!\"\n\nFor the brain to process info, it needs to store it first. There are different kinds of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term. First, it gets encoded, which is like putting a code on it. There are different types of encoding for different kinds of sensory stuff. For example, if you read a word, it gets encoded based on how it looks, what it sounds like, or what it means. Once it's stored, it needs to be kept safe. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which lasts for about 20 seconds, is like a temporary electrical signal that keeps going for a little while. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are a bunch of different models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, like the way people remember stuff, how computers work, or how our brains are wired. The semantic network model says that there are like nodes that represent ideas, and they're connected based on how related they are. For example, the idea of a chair might be linked to a table, which is linked to wood, and so on.",
            "It's like Aldous Huxley was totally worried about how technology and capitalism were becoming super threatening in the novel Brave New World. He imagined a future where people would actually be more into being part of a community than being individuals. They'd be brainwashed from birth to go for immediate happiness over everything else. It's like these people were just pawns in some giant game, forced to stick to one way of thinking by the World Controller. If you look at the book through the lens of Marxist ideas, you can tell Huxley was really skeptical about the whole system. He used a lot of terms from Marxism, like how people become the same and stuff gets turned into objects, to show how he thought the capitalist system was messed up.\n\nHe also used satire to make fun of capitalism by saying that people are tricked into not knowing the real deal about the classes in society. It's like, the common people only care about their own stuff, and they don't really get how things work. This is because the people in charge are controlling what they think and want. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, just go along with it because they're conditioned to want to buy and spend and indulge. It's all manipulated by the World Controller, who's like the ultimate puppet master.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that the lower classes are being dominated by the upper classes. They're like, completely clueless about the system, just 'buying into' an idea that keeps them in their place. Even the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, just go along with it. They're not really doing anything to change things. The way the different classes interact with each other is a big clue about how capitalism is oppressing people.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are super shallow. The characters are basically just one-dimensional. It's like Huxley is saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and creativity. Love and strong emotions don't exist; people just talk about how good-looking someone is, or how great their experiences are. Each class is just happy with their place in society, which is a big sign of how capitalism is affecting people. They're just obeying the rules and doing what they're told, like the Marxist idea of the proletariat being tricked into thinking they're better than everyone else if they just consume and follow the rules.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now - or four and a half semesters if you count the semesters. It's a big campus, and getting around can be a real drag. Last year I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is pretty far out there, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Going from my Stuart Hall home to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially if it's raining or something. I talked to an alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not long ago, East Halls was basically a separate part of campus, surrounded by empty space. Now that's all filled up with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? On a college campus, I think the best answer is the humble bike. But it's not just about having a bike - people actually have to ride them, and the campus needs to be bike-friendly.\n\nI was talking to a friend who got back into biking after a few years off, and he was saying how he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Plus, biking is great for your body, and it's super efficient. I can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride my bike 30 miles or more. I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Getting a bike was one of the smartest things I did this year. I have class in Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with a bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The problem is, Pollock Road is the shortest route to Thomas, but it's not always easy to ride on. I also like biking because I'm too busy to walk, and walking would take up way too much of my time. If I didn't have my bike, I'd have to walk to Thomas every day, which would take an extra 30-40 minutes. That's over two and a half hours every week, and I just don't have that kind of time to waste."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",

With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm planning to go into social work and eventually land a job with the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to help out kids who've been through a tough time and offer support to their families. Some values that I think are super important for my career are service, respect, and being ethical - I want to make sure I'm helping people and relationships in the best way possible, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills so I can be the best social worker I can be. These aren't just principles that I think are cool for social workers - they're also really important to me personally.\n\nI've always wanted to help others, but I wasn't sure what career path to take. In high school and college, I saw a lot of people dodging their problems or using not-so-great coping mechanisms. After seeing so many people dealing with tough stuff, I decided to study Psychology in college. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still unsure about what to do next. One summer day, I visited a friend and met a 16-year-old kid who was really stressed out. He was trying to escape his abusive parents, and it was pretty eye-opening for me. The next day, I found out he'd called the cops on his parents. I drove over to their place and told the police about my concerns and my degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do. When I asked them about the situation, they seemed really nervous and tried to make excuses for their son's behavior. That experience made me think seriously about going into social work to help kids deal with family problems.\n\nSocial justice is another important value for me in the social work field. We say that every individual matters, but I think people just say that because it sounds good - we tend to follow old ways of thinking rather than being truly unique. That's why I'm not into trying to fit in with everyone else. I've always stood up for what I believe in: coloring my hair weird colors, wearing clothes that show my personality, getting piercings, joining GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I see it. I'm all about social justice and I'm going to keep speaking out against things that aren't right.",
            "This paper examines the intersection of biological and sociocultural models in understanding the sleep disorder, insomnia. The biological model delves into the genetic factors and medical aspects that contribute to the condition, while the sociocultural model explores environmental influences, demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Below is an overview of the research related to each model and how they shed light on the complexities of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health issues, and sleep problems caused by medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, involve difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder, are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep. Insomnia specifically refers to a persistent difficulty in sleeping.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders zeroes in on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects that influence sleep patterns. Research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, as crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study found that mice lacking phenotypic GABAB receptors on these neurons exhibited disrupted sleep-wake cycles. Activating the GABAA receptor enhanced sleep, while inhibiting it reduced anxiety and induced sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This study implies that a genetic or environmental issue with this receptor could affect a person's ability to sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study suggest that inherited traits could regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor might naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life and tasks that require focus and concentration.",
            "This paper delves into three main areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it gives a brief rundown on what CAPD is all about. Next, diagnosis is explained, including the key signs or \"red flags\" that point to the condition. Finally, the paper wraps up with ways that a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder, is a condition where the brain can't quite process the sounds we hear, even though we can hear them just fine. So it's not like we're hearing-impaired, but more like our brain has trouble sorting out what we're hearing - like separating words from background noise. This disorder is also known as (C)AP, which refers to the way our central nervous system (CNS) handles auditory information and the brain activity that goes along with it.\n\nCAPD first showed up in research back in the 1950s under the name \"auditory imperception\". It started to gain some attention in the 1950s, when researchers were looking into kids with communication disorders, and the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari developed tests to help identify these kids. In the 1960s, Kimura came up with a way to test this condition using a technique called dichotic testing, and came up with a model to explain how the brain works when it comes to hearing sounds.\n\nPeople with CAPD might have a range of problems - they might have trouble telling where sounds are coming from, or distinguishing between different sounds, or even recognizing patterns in sounds. They might struggle to pick up on changes in voice or tone, or have trouble making sense of sound clues. They might even have trouble figuring out the order of sounds. \n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, you need to get a closer look at how they process sound. This can involve observing their listening behavior and testing their auditory skills with a range of tools and techniques, including questionnaires and surveys, and even recording the sounds inside their ears to see how their brain responds. There isn't one single test that's foolproof, and there's no known cause for the condition. Some tests present a bunch of sounds at once and ask the person to pick out specific sounds, while more advanced tests measure how their brain responds to different sounds.",
            "It seems like Twelfth Night is saying that when you pretend to be someone else for a long time, it can be super helpful in fooling people, but at the end of the day, you've got to let go of that disguise or risk losing yourself completely. The thing is, giving up a deception can be tough because it might make you feel really disconnected from the people around you. So, you're basically stuck with a choice between being true to yourself or keeping your relationships intact. Some people might just shrug it off when they find out they've been tricked, but others will not be so cool about it and might even get really upset about the whole thing.\n\nDeception can be especially tricky when it comes to switching up your gender, because it raises a lot of questions. Like, why would someone feel the need to hide who they really are and pretend to be the opposite gender? In Twelfth Night, Viola's got a pretty obvious reason - she wants to protect herself from people who might try to hurt her. She says, \"I'll take you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249) She's saying she needs to pretend to be a man to stay safe.\n\nBut here's the thing, pretending to be a man makes Viola feel cut off from the women around her, and she even gets confused with her twin brother Sebastian, which makes things way more complicated. Olivia starts falling for Cesario (Viola in disguise), and Viola's also got feelings for Orsino, but she's too scared to express them. \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261) It's pretty wild to think that Twelfth Night might be showing how pretending to be someone else can help you figure out your real feelings, like what's going on with Olivia and Orsino.\n\nOne thing that's pretty interesting is that Shakespeare might be using Olivia as a commentary on how people judge others based on how they look. I mean, Olivia is really attracted to Cesario at first, but then she totally switches gears and starts seeing Cesario as family instead of a love interest. \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315) It's like Shakespeare is saying that people might be attracted to things that don't make sense, or that they might be using disguise to explore their own feelings.",
            "People have been talking about how brutal German colonial rule was, especially when it came to the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. But it's way more complicated than just saying that - the German colonial empire was super varied in terms of policies and ruling styles, just like the different places it was in. Even education systems across the colonies were pretty different. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found that there were tons of educated and literate Africans living there. The Germans had actually done a pretty good job of educating people in some of their other colonies, like Kamerun, if you can believe it. \n\nBut South West Africa (where Namibia is now) was like a whole different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government was involved in educating the locals, in South West Africa, the job was pretty much left to missionary groups that got hardly any help from the government. Although the government did invest in educating Europeans living in the colony, setting up schools and stuff, and also kind of regulating the missionary schools. These education policies had some pretty long-lasting effects in South West Africa, even after the Germans lost control. While other German colonies had a lot of educated Africans, in South West Africa, most people were still pretty much uneducated and illiterate. There were a bunch of different reasons for this, and my paper is going to try to figure out what they were, especially by looking at new research about how the settlers and colonial officials felt about the native Africans.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of books and articles about education in the German colonies out there, but most of them are in German and were written during or right after the time of German colonial rule. Most of them just describe what the education systems were like in the different colonies, but later ones did more detailed studies and comparisons. One of the most important ones is a study by Cohen that compares education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen thinks that the big difference between the two is because South West Africa had a lot of settlers, which affected how the colony was run.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as harsh in terms of climate as some of the other German colonies, but it was still pretty dry, especially in some areas. As a result, the European population there was bigger than in some of the other colonies - by 1913 there were almost 15,000 whites living there, compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next biggest settler population, East Africa.",
            "It's hard to list all the different kinds of popular music because the classification has gotten way more complicated over the past 100 years. The thing is, a lot of genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have spawned even more sub and sub-sub genres. Heavy metal rock, which is one of the more diverse and expressive genres, has gotten really crazy in the past 40 years. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, mostly on the darker side, but that's what makes it so unique. People started experimenting with it early on and created their own sub-genres, which led to even more sub-sub-genres. Now it's gotten to the point where it's hard to figure out what heavy metal even is.\n\nBut to understand the metal music that's everywhere today, you gotta know where it came from and why it's a movement, not just a genre. Heavy metal is all about being dark - it's like the 'music of more' with more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more drama. Metal bands are all about being skilled musicians and it shows in their music. Plus, a lot of metal is influenced by psychedelia - a big drug boom in the 70s led to people making crazy music that was out of this world. It's all about the dark, raw emotions that people were feeling, which was new to the music scene back then. Later metal bands even took inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark vibes. Check out these lyrics from Helter Skelter - it's like a wild ride of emotions, almost like a rollercoaster of feelings. Some people even consider it one of the first heavy metal songs ever, and it was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was already on the heavier side. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be just as heavy as the Stones, so they added that song to The White Album.",
            "A whole bunch of years before these Surrealist dudes started painting their trippy masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was secretly painting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a painting from 1910, is like a symbol of this, showing a woman who's totally amazed by the awesome things she sees in her dream world. But it's also super personal, representing Rousseau's own hopes and dreams as an artist - he wanted to be famous, have people like his artwork, and be accepted by other artists and art enthusiasts. But here's the thing: he was stuck with a major internal conflict - should he try to be like everyone else and paint like they do, or be true to himself and do his own thing? The Dream is basically Rousseau's artistic struggle in a nutshell: to play it safe and be accepted by the art world, or to be unique and forge his own path.\n\nTo really get what's going on in The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. This guy was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France called Laval. His dad was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who had a pretty comfy life, but Rousseau didn't have any art training - he just worked a regular job until he was 40, and then started painting as a way to cope with the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight kids. After that, he had one kid left, Julia, and was totally heartbroken. He hoped painting would give him a fresh start. Unlike other artists of his time who made a big deal about painting peasants and stuff, Rousseau was more of a folk painter, just making art like regular people do.\n\nRousseau's desire for recognition is pretty understandable when you think about it: he was basically a self-taught painter who started way later in life, and was working at the same time as all these other famous artists. It's like, he finally got some respect for his art around the same time that Matisse was starting to become a big deal. According to Jan Gordon, in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were like total opposites - Matisse hated painting boring stuff, while Rousseau just wanted to make something so normal that everyone would like it and accept him as a real artist.",
            "Lots of smart people have said that ethics and beauty are connected, that truth and beauty are basically the same thing. I think there's a reason for this deep connection. As John Keats said in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Most of what we know in life comes from school or experience, but we seem to get into ethics and aesthetics in our own way, like Keats said. Both ethics and aesthetics are like trying to describe what makes something beautiful or right, rather than giving a list of rules to follow. We're always talking about why a painting or a book is good, but we can't quite put our finger on it. When someone asks what you like about a favorite work of art or literature, it's usually something like, \"There's just something about it\" before they try to explain it in more detail. I think that art and morals can't be fully explained - they're like something that's too deep to be described. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how hard you try to describe a work of literature, there's still something special about it that can't be captured. I think ethics is the same way. As Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I think that this \"something\" that's hard to put into words is what makes art and morality so powerful, and that's what connects them.\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because they both touch us at a deep, almost unknowable level. We can feel it, but we can't quite explain it. This connection is even stronger with literature. As McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a powerhouse today, a single country with a unique mix of cultures. From the shadow of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, you can feel the same vibe. It's the same culture that runs through Köln on the Rhine River, right through the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Considering all this, it's no big surprise that Germany, as we know it now, is made up of different parts from various tribes. \n\nThe roots of Germany, or Germania, are a topic of heated debate among scholars and historians. One of the most famous theories is that the name comes from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that lived before they crossed the Rhine and fought against the Gauls. However, this is disputed, and some people think the name might have come from a neighborly term in the Gaulish language. Julius Caesar used the word \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he defeated the Gauls and fought against tribes that crossed the Rhine often with unclear motives. He might have taken this word from the Gauls themselves to distinguish between the Gauls and the Germanic tribes that he hadn't conquered yet. \n\nIn his first chapter of the first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine and were constantly at war with the Gauls, fighting almost daily battles. Others think the name Germany might come from the spear called a \"ger\" used in warfare or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud and noisy. \n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that the Germans were originally from the region and hadn't mixed with other cultures at all. He thought it was crazy that anyone would leave their home in Asia or Africa for Italy and then move to Germany, with its harsh environment, rough weather, and tough people, unless it was their true home. \n\nIt was the same with the Romans. They would conquer the lands of Germania for resources and occasionally lead a land campaign, but they mostly just returned home to their empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and skills with the Romans by serving in their army.",
            "I stood there staring blankly in front of me, my mind completely numb to the scene in front of me.  It was like I was a robot, just going through the motions, studying the picture without really thinking about it.  Thoughts kept popping into my head and then quickly disappearing, like they were just passing through.  I felt like I was just along for the ride, not really in control of my own thoughts.\n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was six years old.  So, when an artist friend suggested I get a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, I jumped at the chance.  It's like a tutorial on how to use your brain to draw, teaching you stuff like what a pencil is and how your brain interprets lines.  One of the cool things it teaches is to draw a square frame around the picture you're looking at, so it's not overwhelming.  Like, take a picture of a bunch of fruit on a table in a kitchen - it's just too much to take in.  But with a frame, it's like, just a picture of that fruit on a plain background.\n\nBut at that moment, staring at the fruit in front of me, I couldn't even think about drawing a frame.  I was just in awe, completely blown away by what I was seeing.  I felt like I was a real artist, like I was on the verge of creating something amazing.  I was thinking about all the great artists who came before me, people like Picasso and Monet - they all had their own styles and colors.  If I was going to be an artist, I wanted to be known for something too, so I started thinking about my own style, my own vision.  I called it Work in Brown.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for my pencil, my muscles tensed up and then relaxed as I gripped it tightly.  I was ready to create something amazing, to bring my vision to life.  But then my mind went blank again, and all I could think about was the toilet.  Specifically, the brown mess that someone had left in it.  I tried to flush it away, but it just wouldn't budge.  I stood there, frowning, staring at the mess, feeling like a total failure.  I gripped the mop tightly, ready to tackle the mess, but my hand just sort of hung there, like it was waiting for instructions.  I finally managed to muster up the energy to grab the toilet paper and start mopping up the mess, but it was a total struggle.  I felt like I was in a trance, just going through the motions, not really thinking about what I was doing.  It was like I was a robot, just programmed to clean up after other people.",
            "A lot of teenagers are driving into trouble and accidents behind the wheel.  There are a bunch of factors at play here.  One reason is that teenagers' brains just aren't ready for the dangers of driving yet.  Plus, they're super inexperienced, which leads not only to more fatal crashes but also more vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  And things get even worse when they're driving with their friends - which, let's be real, is pretty much all the time.  Researchers found that the older the passengers in the car, the more accidents happen. \nSome states, like California, have tried to make driving safer for teens by giving them limited driver's licenses that restrict how long they can drive and who can ride with them.  But honestly, these temporary licenses are just band-aids on a bigger issue.  The problem is that as a group, teenagers are just not capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman thinks that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license.  He's found that a lot of people under 19-20 love taking risks just for the thrill of it, and it makes sense to wait until that urge dies down a bit before letting them drive.  If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we'll just keep seeing fatal crashes and the death toll will be huge.  By 2010, a huge number of new teen drivers will be hitting the road, and it's going to be a disaster.  \nSo, what to do?  We could keep teaching driver's ed in schools to get them started, but no one under 18 should be able to drive.  A provisional permit could still be issued beforehand, and they'd need a certain number of practice hours with a licensed driver.  We should just make this a national rule so it's the same everywhere.  It's not a new idea, but it's a good one.",
            "I spent the day in the Library of Congress's archive of old Edison films and watched all the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen of them, and they were all pretty clever. These films use editing tricks to create illusions, and my project was to study their poetics and see how they evolved over time. At first glance, these trick films seem pretty straightforward: they're set in a single room, rarely use camera movement, and stick to one shot per film. But, if you look closer, some of the later films start to break the rules by experimenting with multiple shots.\n\nOne thing that really stands out about these films is that they're all shot in front of a stationary camera, which never moves to follow the action. This style was super common back then and came from the theater, vaudeville, and magic shows. The problem with filming in a static setting is that characters can only move side to side – they can't walk towards or away from the camera. Take the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) for example. The actors come in from the side and just kind of mill around in place.\n\nSince the camera doesn't move, most shots in these films are long shots or medium shots. You almost never see close-ups, which was influenced by the theater and vaudeville traditions where the whole performance was visible at once, framed by the edges of the stage. Actors in these early films never move towards the camera, so close-ups just aren't an option.\n\nMost of these trick films follow a one-shot-per-film rule, which limits them to just a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also means they're mostly just short, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and switching acts with minimal story. However, it's worth noting that what looks like one shot to the viewer can actually be several shots joined together to create an illusion. If you look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), you can see where the physical shots start and stop, even though it's all one shot in your mind.",
            "So, you wanna know about John Taylor of Caroline, right? Well, he was a total die-hard Republican back in the day. This guy was all about farming and politics, which made him super outspoken about personal freedom and government stuff. He was all about preserving and promoting agriculture, and that's basically how he thought about everything, including the government. He wanted to keep it simple and fair, you know? He believed that a farm was the best career, and that's how he built his whole philosophy on government and the Constitution.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a chance to create the ultimate system without being held back by old customs, so he was all about self-government and doing things the right way. He believed in the natural rights of people, like freedom and stuff, and he thought they were all connected - if one was taken away, they'd all suffer. He wanted those rights to be totally off-limits to the government. He thought the \"state of nature\" was all about the strong and mean taking advantage, but in civilization, that shouldn't be how it goes down.\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought a government should be built with both good and bad in mind. He was super strict about his ideas on good and evil, and he said that a government's virtues and flaws are basically human too. He thought good principles should be about protecting people's property, improving farming, and not being too capitalist, and that a government with good principles would work out okay no matter who's in charge, even if they're all about personal gain. But, he believed that self-interest is basically human nature, and it's only bad when it's all about taking from others. A good government is needed to keep people's bad sides in check, but it's gotta be watched closely so it doesn't get worse.\n\nTaylor was like a lot of other Republicans back then - he wanted the Constitution to be taken super literally, with the government only having the powers it was given. He thought a big government is expensive and might be a dictatorship, but he also didn't want it to be too simple or literal, 'cause that could lead to problems. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was the real deal, 'cause it said the US was a bunch of states, not just one country.",
            "Looking back at the data in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a huge drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. It was pretty discouraging and it's hard to figure out why this happened. One possible reason could be the onset of winter at our New England campus, which usually leads to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Also, with the end of the fall semester, people are super busy with schoolwork, grades, and other stuff, so it's easy to forget about the commuter log. Plus, December is the start of the holiday season and everyone's on break, which means fewer people need to come to campus. It wasn't until the spring semester picked up again in late January that things started to look up. However, the low number of submissions in February still didn't make sense. I wondered if it's just that any project like this has a burst of energy at the beginning that eventually fades away. To combat this, we tried the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which actually worked and got people excited again. It was tough to keep the project going, especially with the holiday and semester breaks that always come up in college. \n\nAnother challenge for this project (and probably any other commuting project) is that people really love the freedom, independence, and flexibility that comes with driving their own cars. This is just how our culture is. To get people to switch to alternative modes of commuting, we need to offer some pretty sweet incentives. So, we gave out gift cards to all sorts of places like restaurants, coffee shops, and even a local bookstore. It would've been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, would've affected participation. Maybe it could've even helped us get back on track after that dip in engagement. One thing that didn't change throughout the project was the kind of prizes we offered. If we had announced some bigger prizes in the middle of the project, like a bike in December and a hybrid car in January, it might've made people more excited to participate. The gift cards were cool at first, but who wouldn't be even more stoked if they knew they could win a sick new set of wheels?",
            "I recently learned about exchange traded funds, or ETFs for short. These securities are super flexible and offer the benefits of owning individual stocks, like being able to sell short or buy on margin, but they also give you the diversification of an index fund. Plus, the expense ratios of ETFs are way lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, like the commission fees you pay on each trade, just like when you're buying or selling a stock. Another cool thing about ETFs is the huge variety of funds available, but it's always a good idea for smart investors to check if the benefits they're promised really live up to their hype. For this project, we're going to take a closer look at the ETF IHF and see how its top 10 holdings stack up against owning a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. We're only looking at the top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets, since going over every single holding would be a bit too much. Here's what we found:\n\nTo get a better sense of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can calculate the contributions of each stock to its Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF holds them. Check out the chart below to see the results.\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a return that's 6.11% higher than the ETF IHF, which is a pretty sweet 16% boost. What's more, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than the ETF's, which could be a good thing. But before we get too excited, we need to make sure these results aren't just a fluke. To do that, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% to compare it to the ETF IHF's standard deviation. Stay tuned to see what we find out!",
            "\"Dream-Land\" is widely considered one of Edgar Allan Poe's best poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" which, according to Mabbott, has its roots in Virgil's work. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world in Greek mythology. But what's more interesting is that Poe was heavily influenced by German authors, and one in particular - Gothe. Poe's familiarity with Gothe's writing is evident in his use of \"Thulé\". \n\nThis connection is reinforced by Karl J. Arndt's observation in his book on Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon, which notes the striking similarities between the two poems, suggesting that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature also highlights Gothe's notable works, including the poetic drama Faust, which was published in two parts, first in 1808 and then in 1832, the year of Gothe's passing. Within Faust, there's a poem called \"The King of Thulé\" that tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. The king then becomes a heavy drinker, mourning his lost love. He eventually decides it's his time to die and passes on his possessions, save for the goblet, and throws it into the ocean before taking his own life. The similarities between the King of Thulé and the character in \"Dream-Land\" are uncanny, and some might see it as a darker reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction. Interestingly, Faust was later adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". \n\nPoe references \"ultrama Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", but in \"Dream-Land\", he uses \"Thule\" as a bookend, framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" echoing the themes of loss, loneliness, and a desolate landscape found in \"The King of Thulé\". The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes Thule as a dark, lonely place haunted by the ghosts of dead friends, a world devoid of color. This mirrors the King of Thulé's experience after losing his wife, and it's as if Poe is stepping into Goethe's poem. Given Poe's respect for Tennyson, it's likely he would have been familiar with Goethe's work, and the many reproductions of his works that were being published at the time further solidified Poe's connection to Goethe's writing.",
            "So, I'm wondering if a person could get punitive damages in court if they got hurt in a grocery store after slipping on an applesauce spill because the manager was super careless. He knew there was a mess, but he didn't bother to clean it up for over half an hour because he was eating dinner. He'd been told about the spill not once, but twice. A judge wouldn't just dismiss the person's claim for punitive damages. To get those damages, the person would have to show that the manager did something super bad on purpose, like ignoring the harm it could cause. They'd also have to prove that the manager's actions were really bad and showed a huge disregard for how his actions could affect others. In this case, the person could argue that the manager should have known that not cleaning up the spill would hurt someone, especially since multiple people slipped on the same thing in the months leading up to the accident. The manager still didn't take action, even after knowing this. The person's argument that the manager's actions were really bad is kinda weak, but it's still a valid point since there were six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager still didn't do anything to keep his store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee told the manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in the store. Martin said he was eating dinner and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee told him again, but he still didn't do anything. At 5:30 pm, the person who got hurt, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill and got seriously hurt. Before that, there were five other slip-and-fall incidents in the same store in 2009. Now Palmer is suing the store for both compensation and punitive damages, and we're looking at whether to file a motion to get the punitive damage claim thrown out.\n\nIn California, a person can get punitive damages if the other person did something super mean, like being really cruel or lying to them. The law says that's when someone acts on purpose to hurt someone, or when they don't intend to hurt someone, but they do something really bad and show a huge disregard for other people's safety. The court has said that's when someone knows their actions could cause harm and they still do it anyway.",
            "It's crazy how a class I took almost four years ago in Islam at CBC still has me thinking about this topic.  The question of whether Islam is a hostile religion was a huge deal back then, and I think it's more relevant now than ever.  Since 9/11, I've noticed that mass media has gone from being really negative about Islam and extremists to being super tolerant of it in America - it's like a total 180.  In 2001, I don't think a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his obvious Muslim background, would've even been a possibility.\n\nI'm actually pretty fascinated by the biography of the Prophet Muhammad.  What I learned about him seems to contradict the personality people usually think of when they hear his name.  I thought he was some kind of conqueror who forced people to convert to Islam, but the biography paints a totally different picture - Muhammad as a humble martyr who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  It's like people came to see the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out one by one. \n\nIt's wild how similar some of his 'miracles' are to those of Jesus - like when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed a huge crowd.  The way it's written makes me think the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but just lived in truth and did miracles.  To me, this is a major problem because it downplays the life and miracles of Jesus.  It's like they're trying to take credit for Jesus' life by portraying Muhammad as a similar figure.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that seem like they're trying to show how people came to Islam on their own, but most of them are third-hand accounts.  I'm not a fan of this because it makes the stories seem suspicious and takes away from their impact.  I think their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, but it actually does the opposite.\n\nWhat really gets me is how the biography tries to make Muhammad out to be this awesome, godly man who was humble, wise, and gentle.  But history says otherwise - Muhammad was a pretty powerful guy who rose to power in a way that doesn't exactly scream 'gentle'.  I wonder if Muslims today know the real story behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and values that Jesus had during his lifetime were pretty much left behind in the development of Christianity after he passed away.  If we look at the history of Christianity, it's like watching a ship drift further and further away from its original course. It's clear that today, more and more people are starting to wake up and realize that they've been sailing in the wrong direction. While some traditional folks will stick to what they've been taught, they might not be enough to steer the whole crew back on track. A growing number of people will become more aware of their history and start to crave a return to the original intentions of Jesus and his teachings. It might take a while – decades or even centuries – but it's inevitable that eventually, there will be a major shift. The tide of Christian history will start moving in reverse, stripping away the extra baggage that's accumulated over time, and getting back to the basics. It'll be like rewinding a tape, until all that's left is a clear picture of what Jesus actually preached about. \n\nThis movement will sweep across countries like the US and Europe, influencing millions and bringing people back to the essentials of Jesus' teachings. The church, as an institution, will still be strong enough to lead the way. But as a result of this shift, the diverse and complex landscape of Christianity will simplify into more uniformity. Instead of seeing a million different interpretations and practices, we'll see more and more similarities across the board. Human history's full of these kinds of reversals – think of how Christians used to be persecuted by the Roman Empire, but later it became a Christian institution. We've seen how our country moved from slavery to equality for African-Americans. This big reversal that's coming in the future will happen within Christianity, and it'll be a journey back to the source, leaving diversity behind. A key part of this process will be learning to interpret Jesus' words in a metaphorical way, rather than taking them literally. So, what happened to Jesus' teachings over time?\n\nLooking way back into history, we find that the only thing before Christianity was Judaism. The core of this faith included monotheism, the idea of a divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures. By the time the Romans took over Jerusalem in 63 BCE, the Jewish people weren't a single, unified group. They were divided into different factions, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common folk.",
            "I think that The Jungle really shows us what people are like deep down inside - we're all pretty greedy and self-centered. We only want to make our own lives as good as possible and look out for ourselves, but we don't really care about anyone else. The Jungle shows this in a lot of ways, but one of the most obvious is with the bosses of the big factories. All they care about is making their companies super successful and getting as much money as possible. They don't care if anyone gets hurt or if anything gets in their way. Upton Sinclair's writing, like when he says, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky\", really paints a picture of all the damage that's being done. He's showing how the bosses don't care about anyone or anything that might get hurt by their factories - the pollution, the animal waste, none of it matters to them.\n\nThe bosses also didn't care about their employees, who were working super hard to make them rich. They'd do whatever it took to make a little extra money, and they didn't care who got hurt in the process, \"So it was like one big pot of jealousy and hatred; nobody had any loyalty or decency, and nobody was worth anything more than a dollar\". They made their employees work super long hours and then fired them randomly without any help or notice. Back when The Jungle was written, there weren't really any laws to protect workers, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. The people who worked and lived in Packingtown were basically expected to just deal with the terrible conditions - nobody was there to help them. There were some unions, but they mostly just made money off the workers. The workers were treated like slaves, and that's basically what they were - they were stuck in a system with no way out, and they were described as being as miserable as people were under slavery.",
            "Authors often use various techniques to shape the mood or attitude of their readers towards significant topics. Some techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He sometimes pairs words that normally don't go together to create a distinct atmosphere around an object or subject. At other times, he assigns meaning to a symbol, and then uses it to evoke a certain feeling. Fitzgerald frequently uses this second technique with colors, particularly gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops the meanings of white/gray and then uses them to create a particular impression of a significant object.\n\nFitzgerald builds up the meaning of white/gray by repeatedly using them in the novel. He associates white with being fancy and high-class, with gray being more dull and faded. Fitzgerald introduces this association early on, showing how characters like Daisy and Jordan are always \"in white\" (8). Everyone at parties is wearing white, from Nick's \"white flannels\" (41) to Tom's \"white shirt\" (36). Even the environment is described as having a uniform appearance: the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40) when Nick isn't at a party. To reinforce this association, Fitzgerald describes ordinary, insignificant things with these colors: Nick goes \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and people's names are now \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. He even uses these colors to describe plain or common people and places: Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" (19) together, there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"Italian child\" in the railroad is \"gray\" (26).\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white/gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. He starts by applying this technique to Daisy. After a long time without any significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), making her seem less like a character and more like an accessory Gatsby wants and longs for. Fitzgerald uses this technique more extensively around Daisy to give her an impression of being a uniform addition, for instance, there's a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she's again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is a goldmine for agricultural production thanks to its awesome weather. They grow a lot of stuff there like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squashes, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. It's super in-demand to buy organic food directly from local farmers in the area, with so many people waiting in line to get their hands on it. People are also super into getting their eggs and milk from organic farms. Some of these farms even let people come and explore their operations, and you can go hiking, birdwatching, or just chill there. It's like a win-win situation for the landowner, 'cause they get to get some cash and also help out the environment. This is especially cool 'cause it lets them qualify for government programs that'll help 'em out.\n\nNot only does organic farming bring in some cash, it also makes the area way more diverse in terms of plants and animals. Without all the chemicals, the soil and water are basically a party for all the little critters. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - organic farming can be more expensive in some ways. For example, it takes a lot more work to get rid of pests and weeds, and you gotta put in extra effort to fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Plus, you might end up losing more stuff than you would with regular farming methods. And, if you're a small farm, you're at a disadvantage 'cause big farms are way more efficient. There are other things you can do to help the environment that aren't even about organic farming, like planting special crops to keep pests away, rotating your animals to keep the land healthy, and getting rid of invasive species. All these things can be a real time suck, though.\n\nFor this example, I chose a piece of land in the East County Southern Foothills of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. It's a 160-acre chunk of chaparral, grassland, and oak woodland right next to the Cleveland National Forest. They're still working on the plan, but it's got over a hundred different plants and animals on the list, some of which are super endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are in danger of becoming endangered, like the burrowing owl. This land has been home to Native Americans for who-knows-how-long and was later settled by cattle ranchers and people who sold cordwood back in the 1800s. It was part of an original homestead, so it was probably used for grazing and making wood for a long time.\n\nI picked a real estate listing and looked up what government programs are out there to help small farmers save cash and keep their operations eco-friendly. To get an idea of what it's like, I looked at an actual organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. You can figure out a lot about a culture by looking at what it's not, rather than what it actually is. This culture thing isn't one big, uniform thing - it's super diverse and can change depending on the situation. Statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are way too broad and oversimplify things. It's way more helpful to understand what a culture means in this specific situation and how that culture might affect the conversation. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you're gonna relate to it in your own way, and comparisons are gonna pop up.\n\nIt can take some work to grasp another culture or mindset - you might have to study its history, or try to understand its prejudices. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, just accept it for what it is and work with it. This is especially true in negotiations, especially if you're in a weaker position. If you're \"on the road\" and need to navigate a different culture, showing respect for their traditions and values can actually help you get past any cultural barriers and move the conversation forward.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture isn't just about where you come from or where you're going - it can be something as small as a company's corporate culture. For example, some companies are super strict about working hours, while others are way more relaxed. You can see this in employee dress codes, the way people communicate, and even how they hire people. Take American corporate culture - it's totally different from company to company (and even within companies, it can vary from region to region). Some cultures seem super uniform, but that just means you gotta dig deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more important because it helps you understand why a culture does things a certain way. If saving face or keeping things harmonious is a big deal in a culture, you won't see anyone publicly embarrassing themselves or their boss to get ahead. On the other hand, if a culture values getting a tough deal, they won't be in a rush to settle. Knowing these kinds of things can really help before you get to the negotiation table. But you should also try to learn a bit about your opponent as an individual to make the negotiations go smoothly.",
            "There's this famous Bible verse - \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" - and it's found in Psalm 14. St. Anselm used this quote to start his argument for the existence of God. It's also believed by another big thinker, Thomas Aquinas. Since both of them are trying to prove the same idea, we'll just assume they're both right, because if we use a different idea of God, it'd be hard to compare their arguments. If we do that, it's like comparing apples and oranges. Let's just say they both believe in the Christian God for simplicity's sake. Now, I think both of them have some good points, but neither of them really gives a complete reason to believe in God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He says that we can understand God by looking inside ourselves. He thinks that because we can't really imagine a world without God, that means God must be real. This idea is really like looking at what we already know inside our minds and using that to figure out the truth about God. St. Anselm says we don't need any other proof, that our own understanding is enough. This way of thinking is often called faith in Christian texts. It's like trusting something even if we can't prove it.\n\nThis is different from how Thomas Aquinas thinks. He says that we can prove God exists using logic and things we can see, not just faith. This would be super helpful for spreading the word about Christianity because people wouldn't have to believe it just because someone told them to. They could use their brains to figure it out. St. Thomas presents five different logical reasons to believe in God: change, cause and effect, why things exist, how good things are ranked, and how things fit together. He shows that God is the only thing that makes sense. If someone tells you you're missing a puzzle piece, you can figure out what it's like without actually seeing it.",
            "So, I'm going to tell you about this ancient dude named Buddha, who lived a gazillion years ago, somewhere around the 5th or 6th century BCE. He was a prince, but not just any prince – he was going to become the Buddha. Over time, he ditched the whole royal thing and got enlightened. His teachings ended up creating Buddhism, the most 'orthodox' sect of which is called Theravada Buddhism. This whole thing is over 2,500 years old now, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time. You can see this by looking at Sri Lanka, which is a Theravada nation, and their annual water-cutting ceremony. It's a big deal, with monks and regular folks participating, but Buddha never actually talked about anything like that. These changes go all the way from the surface-level stuff to the core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its rules and principles over time, whether it's due to external or internal factors, or even both. External factors are basically anything that comes from non-Buddhists, while internal factors are stuff that happens within the Buddhist community itself.\n\nThere are some terms that'll come up a lot in this discussion. Internal factors are basically things that come from within the Buddhist community, no matter if someone's a monk or not. External factors are anything that comes from outside the community. A hostile factor is anything that damages or tries to damage the community – basically, anything that has a negative view of Buddhism. A benign factor is something that doesn't want to hurt or help the community, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst off, we need to get a handle on the basics of Theravada Buddhism – the core principles that make it tick. Buddhists find refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Pali Canon, which includes the Tripitaka – the three baskets of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka is all about the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka is about the rules for monks and layfolk, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka is all about the metaphysical stuff, like no soul, inherent suffering, and the impermanence of everything. Understanding these ideas is key to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Along with that, you'll also be done with lobha – desire, dosa – hatred, and moha – delusion when you get enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka lays out the rules for living for both monks and layfolk. For regular folks, there are five precepts (don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't get all crazy with sex, and don't get drunk). Monks have a lot more rules to follow. The fundamental idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and so on.",
            "You won't believe the epic rivalry that went down between the US and Mexico for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893.  It was like, a major thing (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145).  The rivalry was like, at its peak during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the US totally came at Mexico, kicked its butt, and took Texas and the Southwest as its own (I'm talking the US, not me, I wasn't born yet).  We're not the only ones, though - lots of countries with a history of clashes with their neighbors.  It's pretty common for countries that share borders to have major disagreements that fuel their rivalry (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  The US and Mexico were no exception - our rivalry started with some major disagreements over stuff like religion, culture, and tradition.  It's like, a big clash of interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).  \n\nThis whole rivalry thing isn't unique to us, though.  Other countries that share borders often develop similar rivalries.  David M. Pletcher (1977) said, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  Both of these countries are, like, right next to the US, and we've had a rivalry with them for a while.  Other countries in Latin America, though, have generally gotten along with us just fine.  \n\nReligion was a major point of contention between the US and Mexico, just like it has been in many other countries throughout history.  Sally Frahm (2001) said that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  It's kinda like how the Cold War was both an ideological struggle and a competition over interests, but with us, it was more about our differing views on religion.  We got these feelings of distrust from our colonial past with the English and Spanish, and that just made things worse (Diehl and Goerts 2000).  \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 major disputes between the US and Mexico during that 57-year rivalry period.  Most of those disputes were about territorial issues, like border raids from Mexico into the US and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a huge problem until we and Mexico both started cracking down on our borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).  Schmitt (1974) said that the rivalry started to die down as Mexico became more dependent on the US and our goals changed from expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110).",
            "I was hit with an unexpected illness fifteen years ago that left me in a state of disability that I had never anticipated. I was working as a nurse at the time and had chosen the profession to escape the uncertainty of my childhood. People kept telling me, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always need help.\" But my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist - maybe a little bit of both. Despite the doubts, I stuck with nursing.\n\nNow, I'm 46 and single, living on Social Security Disability after fifteen years. I've got nothing to show for it, and every day feels like a struggle to stay afloat. I'm still in a constant state of uncertainty, but one thing is clear - without the support of my family and a few close friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. When disaster strikes, you realize how weak you are, not strong.\n\nMy point is that life is full of emergencies, big and small, and no matter how prepared you are, some things are just too big to handle on your own. We need to stop putting all our faith in the government and learn to rely on each other instead. Trusting others and asking for help is a much better approach than building individual fallout shelters.\n\nThe idea of \"rugged individualism\" that the Conservatives in the US love to talk about isn't what kept our ancestors going in hard times. It was actually compassion, mutual respect, and sharing resources that got them through. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it alone - they worked together.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared and have your disaster kit ready. I've got mine set up with first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and lots of other essentials. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors and build a community that can support each other. It's a much better approach than going it alone.",
            "I've been wondering why organisms evolve the way they do and whether there are any limits that shape the direction of evolutionary change. Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson said that it's almost impossible for biologists to put the fundamentals of organic forms into mathematical terms, and we're still not there yet. But lately, scientists have started using math to study the development of shell growth in mollusks, looking at both how they grow over their lifetime and how their ancestors evolved (think Raup and Stanley from 1981). Our research is trying to figure out how using math to model this growth, combined with actual experiments, can help us understand why and how certain traits develop during evolution. To do this, we took X-ray images of different species of Prunum and used them to identify factors that we could use to model different shell shapes. We plugged these factors into a special computer program called CerioShell (created by Stone in 1995) to see what different shapes might be possible. Then we combined these results with experiments and observations to better understand how big evolutionary changes happen in this group of animals.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that spins around in space, kind of like a 360-degree turn. These turns are called whorls, and they're like layers that spiral around an imaginary middle point, which is called the columella. The speed at which these layers grow can be different, and the lines that separate them are called sutures. In most shells, the biggest layer is the last one (the body whorl), and the spire is all the layers except that one. The pointy end is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal sticks out of its shell through a hole called the aperture.\n\nShells can be looked at in different ways, like from the top or bottom, or from the side. Most people look at shells with the hole facing them and the pointy end up.\n\nNow, let's talk about how to count the layers of a shell. First, you look at the top of the shell, and then you find the line where the first layer starts. Then you draw a line down the middle of the shell, and count the layers from there. You can even estimate layers that are almost complete.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of holes that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can actually track the path of the hole by looking at the center of each layer and how big the hole is. This path can be shown as a graph or math problem. Once you have a math problem, you can change the variables and see how it affects the way the shell grows.",
            "The rate of newborn and infant deaths in Indonesia has pretty much stayed the same for the last ten years.  Even though they're making progress in some areas, like water and sanitation, they're missing the mark on reducing child and mom health problems.  I'm going to break down the reasons why, and it shows that Indonesia needs to focus on making their health system stronger instead of just having a bunch of programs.\n\nThey've made some improvements in getting health workers to be present at births, with 72% of births meeting this goal.  But let's not get too excited – it's not all good news.  This number includes traditional workers, like midwives, who can't help if things get complicated.  It's kind of like a puzzle, and some of the pieces are still missing.  Also, there's been a drop in the number of kids under five getting medical help for diarrhea.  And don't even get me started on post-natal care – it's a total concern, and the data isn't even complete.\n\nC-section rates are still way too low, around 4%.  And this number has its own problems too.  In cities, c-sections make up 7% of births, but in the countryside, it's only 2%.  This shows us that there's a big gap in healthcare access between cities and the country.  It's like having a health system with a big gap in the middle.\n\nAnother problem is that the rich have way more access to healthcare than the poor.  There's a 27% difference between the richest and poorest families.  It's pretty obvious that the poor are getting left behind because healthcare costs are just too high.  So, what's next?  How do we fix this?  The question is, should Indonesia focus on making one specific area better or strengthen their whole health system?  It seems like the latter would be the way to go, but there are some things to consider.\n\nHere's the thing: focusing on one area can be pretty tempting.  It's easy to see results, and it's a more manageable goal.  But there are some downsides.  If you put too much money into one area, the other areas are going to suffer.  And people will want to work in the area that's getting the most funding.  For example, think about what happened when they put a lot of money into dealing with HIV/AIDS – it hurt the family planning program.  Also, with all these programs running at the same time, it gets really confusing.  You end up with a lot of repetition and paperwork.  It's not the most efficient way to do things.",
            "Victorian novels are super detailed and super focused on the aristocracy, but not all of them are like that.  Two that stand out are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These books have mystery and weirdness in them, which helps readers understand the characters better. It's like you get to see inside their heads and figure out what they're thinking and feeling.\n\nI'm talking about the time I was walking with Sikes and Crackit, and we were yelling at each other.  It felt like the words we said were still echoing in my head, and when I tried to focus, I found myself talking to them.  Then there was this loud noise, like gunshots, and people were shouting and lights were flashing all around me.  I felt like I was being pulled away, but I couldn't control it.  There was this nagging feeling of pain that wouldn't go away – it was like someone was constantly poking at me.\n\nIn these two books, the authors use dreamlike scenes to show what's going on inside the characters' heads. In Oliver Twist, these visions often reveal stuff about Oliver's inner world, like what's bothering him and what he really thinks about what's happening. When Oliver gets shot, it's like he relives the whole thing in his head, over and over again.  He's trying to find help, but he's all numb and can't seem to do anything.  It's like his senses are all messed up, and he's stuck in this nightmare.  The whole thing is pretty overwhelming, and it makes you wonder who's really in control of Oliver's life – is it him, or is someone else calling the shots?  It's like he's given up, and that's not a good sign.\n\nThe next day was a blur – it felt like it came and went in an instant.  There was this endless, creepy silence, and then suddenly it was night again.  Night seemed to drag on and on, but at the same time, it felt like it was over before it even started.",
            "A couple years ago, I had a pretty cool experience working in an after-school program where I helped Elementary age students with their schoolwork. I tried my best to assist them with whatever subject they were struggling with, but my strengths were in English and reading. One kid in particular caught my attention – a little dude named Adrian, who was maybe in third or fourth grade. He was having some major trouble reading, but it wasn't because he didn't understand the words, it was because he didn't know the English alphabet all that well. At first, I thought something was really off, like he had some sort of learning disability or something, but it turned out he was just missing the basics. I remember his mom walking in during one of our sessions, and she didn't speak a word of English – only Spanish. We managed to communicate somehow, but it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, but he just needed help with the alphabet. I'm not sure if that epiphany helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story because it highlights the problem of language barriers in schools, especially out here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even for kids who speak perfect English, reading can still be super tough. Everyone agrees this is a problem, so the question is, what do we do? For Adrian, the solution was pretty simple: some extra help with English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. We've got dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and more – none of these things alone will fix the problem. The key is to combine them all.\n\nThe dual language system is actually a great idea, not just for kids who speak Spanish at home, but for all kids. Studies have shown that kids in two-way bilingual programs do way better academically. A lot of people are scared of this idea, thinking it's a waste of resources and that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, all kids would benefit from them. So, how do we make this happen? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. What we can do is have special assistants, tutors, or whatever you call them, who are bilingual. That way, every kid can get the help they need to succeed.",
            "We've all been told from a young age that there's something greater than us out there - something we can't quite wrap our heads around. We're sent to church, temple, or search within ourselves for answers. Many of us stick with what our parents taught us, while others reject it completely, convinced that there's nothing beyond our own little world. We might experiment with different values, switching from one to another, trying to figure out who we are through our own unique spiritual perspectives. We're all on a quest to find a guiding light in the darkness and push through the shadows into the light.\n\nMy dad and I sat on the porch, listening to the rain pelt the metal roof, when he told me his favourite bird was the cardinal. We both smoked our cigarettes in silence, surrounded by the sound of the rain pouring down through the gutters, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes lost in thought, his body frail and thin from months of sickness. His hair had thinned out too, and his clothes hung loosely on him. I felt a mix of emotions: fear, sadness, and a desperate urge to talk to him about how much I'd miss him, but I knew that would only make it more real. Instead, I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in staring out at the rain-soaked sky.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but it was a cruel joke - what was the point of living longer when it was just more pain? I'd stopped believing in God a long time ago, and I didn't bother with prayers that night. If he existed, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch my dad slip away. So I didn't. I couldn't bear to see the person who created me die. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he left this world. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't want his only child to be there for his death. For three days, I curled up in a ball and waited for the news. But when it finally came, there was no phone call.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is basically an oxymoron, where 'old' and 'new' blend together, as Ian Watt described it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This genre has been both slammed and praised, accused of lacking depth, and admired for its 'terrible sublime' aspect (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined the ideas of old romance and modern novels to create the proto-Gothic genre. It was a new way of expressing literary ideas. Walpole used a mix of old theatrical elements and the modern novel's naturalism to present his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre borrowed from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. When The Castle of Otranto came out, the term \"gothic\" was already associated with different people, styles, and time periods. It was seen as outdated or unsophisticated compared to 'modern' societal and literary advancements. The blend of the theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new format (which allowed readers to see the characters' psychology up close) helped the Gothic genre last and become both old and new to readers who were far away from the original writing.\n\nOne of the key gothic ideas in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, a knight's training process, is both kept and changed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight – brave, honorable, and capable – and the supposed lack of that ideal in society. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized (foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and used to try to improve the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a time of political turmoil, was disheartened about the future and thought that the supposed morality and 'goodness' in people present in the gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This is clear in his character Frederic, who is described as a prince who has suffered, been affected by tragedy, and is supposed to have been killed by infidels. The description of him includes many chivalric images, like being gallant and courteous. This exaggeration brings the Gothic trope of excess into play (66).",
            "So I'm gonna tell you about supply chain management. It's like a big process of getting stuff from the customer's order all the way to the raw materials stage, then to supply, production, and finally to the customers. The term supply chain management was basically invented by Keith Oliver in 1982. He's a consultant and he described the whole process of planning, implementing, and controlling the chain to get stuff to customers super fast and efficiently. I mean, he made it sound so cool.\n\nSo there are six key things that make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six things to give customers the best service ever. It's like a big puzzle that they have to figure out.\n\nThe first step in the puzzle is production. It's like the foundation of the whole thing. Production tells you when, why, where, and how stuff gets made. Managers have to know what customers want, right? They can check out the market to figure out what customers are looking for. The market is like a big indicator of what customers are demanding. Once they know what customers want, they can decide what to make, how much to make, and where to make it. They have to think about the customer's demand and satisfaction, you know?\n\nFor example, if I worked at Wal-Mart or Target, they would have a super cool design book with steps for every little thing, from what employees wear to how to get shipments from trucks. Having all that planned out helps the company avoid confusion and run smoothly.\n\nThe second key thing in supply chain management is supply. It's like making strategic decisions about what your company can do and who you can partner with. You might have different divisions for different products, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers have to decide which division is best for each product. Sometimes, they might even outsource work to other companies to make things faster and cheaper.\n\nThat's basically it, folks. Supply chain management is all about getting stuff to customers efficiently and effectively.",
            "I saw a weird sign on the street today that said \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the Juno star, was holding that sign with a Sharpie, and it made me think of the country next to India, Myanmar, which is ruled by a super harsh military control group. They took over back in 1962. There were these big protests in 2007, the Saffron Revolution, where thousands of monks marched in the streets. The monks wore these bright orange robes, and it was a big deal. At first, the government was cool with them protesting, but things escalated quickly, and the monks and the military were fighting like crazy. The military even broke into some of the monasteries and arrested journalists who were just trying to report on the whole thing. A Japanese journalist got killed just for being there. The government says 13 people died, but another soldier who defected said way more people died, like thousands. It's not like this is a new thing, though. Governments have been trying to suppress people for as long as we've had societies. Even the ancient Romans thought their emperors were gods. The Japanese emperor is considered a god too, and some people think he brought us cell phones and cool ways to kill yourself. Even our current president talks to some dude named Ted Haggard who leads a group called the Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nI was thinking about all the times when people tried to stand up to their governments and got crushed. Like that one time in China in 1989 when students and intellectuals protested and the government killed a bunch of them. We still don't know exactly how many died, but it was way more than what the government said. There was that other time in Rwanda in the 90s when the government helped kill all these people just because they were from a different group.

When you listen to a lot of his music, you might not notice him playing piano, but as a composer, he was totally awesome at making complex pieces that featured each musician's special talents. Ellington created the perfect setting for a soloist to improvise, and at the same time, he wrote music that was really tight and had certain sections with specific styles that fit the band members. He basically helped the whole orchestra sound like one coherent unit, creating unique sounds for each song. By understanding how each musician sounded separately and how they fit together, Ellington could write some of the most innovative music in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington's style and innovation, and mentions Creole Love Call as an example of him using voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This is like, an early example of Ellington's ability to mix voice with other sounds without words getting in the way. Creole Love Call also shows how Ellington could make the style of his soloists shine. This slow twelve bar blues piece has six choruses, which are kinda like the different parts of the song. Here's what each one's like:\n\nChorus 1: It's like a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice starts smooth and then gets all rough at the end.\nChorus 2: There's a muted trumpet solo that takes the main melody and adds some extra blue notes.\nChorus 3: It's a really high clarinet solo with a piano phrase that's kinda syncopated.\nChorus 4: The whole band repeats the first chorus, but this time it's like a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: This is the climactic part of the song, where the reeds start doing the call and response in a high register and the brass and rhythm sections are doing their own thing.\nChorus 6: It's back to the first chorus, but now the voice is doing this \"growl\" thing and soloing like an instrument.\nTag: There's a little tag at the end with a vocal run and some crazy notes from a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add a new dimension to his music is just one example of how he did things his own way and influenced a lot of other musicians. In Hot and Bothered, he uses his skills at making music sound really tight and his ear for tone color to create a really cool sound. In It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to make the melody on muted trombone sound really cool.",
            "It was this gnawing feeling that she'd had for years. It started when she hit 14 and entered the whirlwind of being a teenager. Even three years later, at 17, it was still there, driving her to think that she needed something more. But it wasn't a thing - it was a person. Yet, none of the guys she met seemed to be the one. Some had tried to swoop in, making awkward attempts to win her over, but nothing clicked. She'd often ask herself what was going on, wondering what it was that made a teenage girl feel this way. Years of pondering had brought up a bunch of theories, but none stuck.\n\nHer home life was usually pretty chill. Her parents were good people, always calm and laid-back. They rarely fought, and when they did, it was usually about her desire for independence and her free-spirited nature. She was their calm daughter, but in a weird way, their opposing energies made her stand out - she was fun, outgoing, and nice.\n\nToday, though, was a different story. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard her mom's voice, laced with panic, coming from the kitchen. She ran in to find her mom on the ground, wincing in pain, saying \"Ow\" over and over. Her daughter rushed to her side, putting a hand on her to help, and asked, \"Mom, what's wrong?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mom managed to stammer out, \"Ouch...sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter sprang into action, helping her mom to the car and driving her to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a place of disinfectant and fear, but she was too worried about her mom to feel it. She rushed her to the doctors, who quickly took her mom to get checked out. Her daughter was left pacing, worried sick. It turned out her mom had fallen off a step stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to show that sticking to the Mediterranean Diet, known as the \"aMed diet\", helps cut down on the risk of heart disease and stroke. The aMed diet is a special version of the traditional Mediterranean diet and is all about eating more plant foods, like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less animal products and fats. \n\nPrevious studies had already found that people who follow the Mediterranean diet are less likely to die from heart problems, and another study proved that it's even better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering bad cholesterol levels in obese people. However, these studies didn't look at the impact of the diet on stroke specifically.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 female nurses, aged 38 to 63, who were already participating in a big research project called the Nurses' Health Study. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated how well each nurse followed the aMed diet by asking them about their eating habits in surveys every six years. Almost all of the nurses kept participating for the whole 20 years. The researchers also checked the nurses' medical records to see if they had heart problems or strokes and made sure that the information was accurate. \n\nTo get a better picture of the nurses' eating habits over time, the researchers averaged out their aMed diet scores from their surveys over the years. They also adjusted for things that could affect the results, such as the nurses' age, weight, smoking habits, and exercise routine.\n\nUsing special math, the researchers found that women who followed the Mediterranean diet closely had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke. After 20 years, they found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 heart disease deaths. The women who followed the diet the best were less likely to get heart disease and stroke compared to those who followed it the least.",
            "It's crazy to think that like, 15 years ago, the United States went through a major financial crisis. People lost their jobs, houses were becoming worthless, and huge corporations were on the verge of collapse. So, the question remains: how did this all go down, and how can we avoid it happening again? The whole thing started with some pretty silly and not-so-smart political decisions that basically forced banks to give out bad loans to people who couldn't afford them. At the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being pressured into buying up these bad mortgages and turning them into even more complicated financial messes. When people started defaulting on their loans, the banks were left in a tough spot and just shifted the blame to the people who bought those bad mortgages from them.\n\nIt all started to unravel back in the late 90s, when President Clinton was trying to get re-elected. He relaxed some rules, hoping to make himself look good, and that's when things started to go downhill. In 1999, Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote, \"Fannie Mae was under a lot of pressure from the government to give out more loans to people who can barely afford them, and from stockholders to keep making money.\" He basically predicted that this would all end badly: \"This government-subsidized company might get into trouble when the economy slows down, and we might need to bail them out like we did with the savings and loan industry back in the 80s.\" \n\nA bunch of other factors contributed to the whole mess, like the crazy new types of mortgages people were getting, such as adjustable-rate mortgages and CDOs. This just made things way more complicated and connected to the housing market. It was like, people and banks got in way over their heads, and when the housing bubble burst, they were all like, \"What do we do now?\" The top five investment banks in the US had like, $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which was a third of the country's GDP. In the end, some of these banks got sold super cheap, others got shut down, and Fannie and Freddie were basically taken over by the government because they were so deep in debt.",
            "Exposition - that infamous section in your story where you spread your wings as a writer but end up putting most of your readers to sleep or making them hit the \"Back\" button in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her monitor when she gets stuck in the land of Too Much Information, and for good reason. Exposition is not your BFF (best friend forever).\n\nYou probably know the drill: \"Show, don't tell.\" But Dr. Merlin still finds herself rambling on with unnecessary backstory, or worse, dragging readers through a boring forest of details. Exposition is that pesky voice in your head that says, \"Get the history over with so we can get to the good stuff.\" Just don't confuse it with the other voice that's all like, \"Tell us everything about the main character's mom's cat.\"\n\nSo, what is exposition, exactly? It's when you tell your readers what happened instead of showing them. Think about it like a film where one character is dumping a huge load of info on another character, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, you're the one doing the dumping.\n\nLet's look at an example. Imagine you're reading a story and it goes something like this: \"The heroine met her husband at such and such a time, and they got married in a big way, but he ended up getting murdered in front of her. Yeah, that's it.\" You wouldn't expect a two-page explanation of the whole thing, with only two lines of dialogue from the couple. That's just boring. What you'd want is to see how much the husband loves his wife through the way he talks and acts, and how her life changes with him. If the story later says they had a deep connection, you'd want to see evidence of that in the story itself. You'd get to experience the husband's death with the heroine and become more connected to her character.\n\nSo, as a writer, you need to add some meat to the bare bones of the storyline. It's tempting to rush through certain parts, but don't - take the time to develop your characters and make them real. You might know that your character used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station at night, and dreams of owning the place one day, but do you really need to tell us all that at once? Keep it simple and let your readers experience it through the story itself.",
            "Today I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one I saw was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), and guess what? It was a live show! The leading story was about a sick guy in Ashley, Ohio who stabbed his wife - they didn't say her name, just his, Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and let me tell you, he looked like a total creep. They only gave it two minutes, which I thought was fair since the story was still developing. The details they did give were pretty basic - he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested.\n\nThe second story was about a shooting involving an 18-year-old kid named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He got shot and was in critical condition, but no arrests had been made, and there were no suspects yet. The SWAT Team was investigating, which seemed a little weird considering there wasn't much info on the case. I've noticed this before: minorities get glossed over when they're victims of a crime. For some reason, if it's a white person who gets hurt or kidnapped, the media goes crazy, but if it's a minority, it's like they're not even important. \n\nNext up was a story about a gunshot hole in the Med-Flight helicopter. They gave some details about where they think the incident happened and what kind of bullet was used (a .22 caliber from a rifle). They're offering a five-thousand dollar reward for anyone who can give 'em a lead on the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the rain and thunderstorms that were supposed to hit on Saturday afternoon. They said the temps would be in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but that was about it - I guess they wanted to leave us hanging so we'd keep watching.\n\nThey also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said the thief was a black guy wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, about six-foot-tall and 150 pounds. They made a big deal about how dark-skinned he was, which seemed kinda weird.\n\nAnother story was about Rene Rodriguez, some dude who got convicted of smuggling a bunch of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. He got sentenced to 300 months in prison (which I guess means 25 years, but I'm not really sure why they said it that way). They also mentioned he's Hispanic, which I don't think was really necessary.",
            "There's a deep, unbreakable connection between brothers that's hard to put into words. This bond is made up of a mix of feelings, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have this unique understanding of each other that's hard to find with anyone else. They can see themselves through their brother's eyes, and it's only when things get really tough that the true nature of this bond shows up – whether it's good or bad. However, it comes at a cost, and part of understanding this bond means dealing with the consequences that come with it. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see your own reflection staring back, and it's a look at yourself, not as others see you, but as you really are.  In the long run, it's the choices you make and the consequences that follow that show your true character.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is really brought out through the two brothers' crazy, intense emotions. They're on this wild, impossible journey, and in the end, bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a super dramatic moment. Only one of them makes it out alive. The author uses the protagonist's character and how he interacts with his brother, as well as the narrator's point of view, to show just how complicated these feelings can be. The whole story is centered around one main emotion: pride. From the very start, the protagonist feels really resentful towards his little brother, Doodle. He wanted a brother who could do all the cool stuff he was good at, like holding his breath or climbing trees. But Doodle was born with a weak heart, and it was clear he'd never be able to do those things. The protagonist's whole world was crushed when he realized his dreams were gone. In fact, he even thought about hurting his little brother at one point, which is pretty shocking. But when Doodle smiles, it makes the protagonist's heart melt. It shows that deep down, he really loved his brother and didn't want to hurt him. This whole thing is a wild ride, and it's amazing how easy it is to get caught up in your own emotions and forget what's most important.",
            "The brain is like a super cool, super complicated info machine that's been around for a long time. Over time, people have used all sorts of cool metaphors to describe it. They first compared it to a wax tablet, then a piece of papyrus, then a book, and now to a computer. But keep in mind that these metaphors aren't perfect and can lead to some pretty wild conclusions.\n\nSo here's how it works: your senses like eyes, ears, and skin take in the physical stuff around you, like touch, heat, sound, or light. They turn that into a secret language that the brain can understand. This information gets processed over and over again in two ways: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box, your brain puts together simple stuff like color, shape, and where the edges are to figure out that it's a box. Then, it uses what it's already learned to help you recognize the box even faster. It's like when you look at a picture of a pizza and your brain is like, \"Oh, it's a circle with cheese and sauce!\"\n\nOnce the brain's processed the info to some extent, it decides how important it is and which other brain processes it should get to look at it. For instance, you might be walking through the park and your brain is processing every single blade of grass, but it only lets you notice the really important stuff, like the person talking to you. There are a lot of stages of processing, and the brain's like, \"Hey, I think this is cool, let me take a closer look!\" or \"Nope, this isn't that important, move on!\"\n\nFor the brain to process info, it needs to store it first. There are different kinds of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term. First, it gets encoded, which is like putting a code on it. There are different types of encoding for different kinds of sensory stuff. For example, if you read a word, it gets encoded based on how it looks, what it sounds like, or what it means. Once it's stored, it needs to be kept safe. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which lasts for about 20 seconds, is like a temporary electrical signal that keeps going for a little while. Long-term memory is thought to be stored in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are a bunch of different models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, like the way people remember stuff, how computers work, or how our brains are wired. The semantic network model says that there are like nodes that represent ideas, and they're connected based on how related they are. For example, the idea of a chair might be linked to a table, which is linked to wood, and so on.",
            "It's like Aldous Huxley was totally worried about how technology and capitalism were becoming super threatening in the novel Brave New World. He imagined a future where people would actually be more into being part of a community than being individuals. They'd be brainwashed from birth to go for immediate happiness over everything else. It's like these people were just pawns in some giant game, forced to stick to one way of thinking by the World Controller. If you look at the book through the lens of Marxist ideas, you can tell Huxley was really skeptical about the whole system. He used a lot of terms from Marxism, like how people become the same and stuff gets turned into objects, to show how he thought the capitalist system was messed up.\n\nHe also used satire to make fun of capitalism by saying that people are tricked into not knowing the real deal about the classes in society. It's like, the common people only care about their own stuff, and they don't really get how things work. This is because the people in charge are controlling what they think and want. The lower classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, just go along with it because they're conditioned to want to buy and spend and indulge. It's all manipulated by the World Controller, who's like the ultimate puppet master.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that the lower classes are being dominated by the upper classes. They're like, completely clueless about the system, just 'buying into' an idea that keeps them in their place. Even the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, just go along with it. They're not really doing anything to change things. The way the different classes interact with each other is a big clue about how capitalism is oppressing people.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between people are super shallow. The characters are basically just one-dimensional. It's like Huxley is saying that technology and capitalism are taking away people's free will and creativity. Love and strong emotions don't exist; people just talk about how good-looking someone is, or how great their experiences are. Each class is just happy with their place in society, which is a big sign of how capitalism is affecting people. They're just obeying the rules and doing what they're told, like the Marxist idea of the proletariat being tricked into thinking they're better than everyone else if they just consume and follow the rules.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years now - or four and a half semesters if you count the semesters. It's a big campus, and getting around can be a real drag. Last year I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is pretty far out there, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Going from my Stuart Hall home to classes in places like the Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially if it's raining or something. I talked to an alum who's not much older than me, and they told me that not long ago, East Halls was basically a separate part of campus, surrounded by empty space. Now that's all filled up with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and apartments. As the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get from one place to another. So, what's the solution to this problem? On a college campus, I think the best answer is the humble bike. But it's not just about having a bike - people actually have to ride them, and the campus needs to be bike-friendly.\n\nI was talking to a friend who got back into biking after a few years off, and he was saying how he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Plus, biking is great for your body, and it's super efficient. I can eat a bowl of oatmeal and ride my bike 30 miles or more. I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Getting a bike was one of the smartest things I did this year. I have class in Thomas building every day, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. But with a bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The problem is, Pollock Road is the shortest route to Thomas, but it's not always easy to ride on. I also like biking because I'm too busy to walk, and walking would take up way too much of my time. If I didn't have my bike, I'd have to walk to Thomas every day, which would take an extra 30-40 minutes. That's over two and a half hours every week, and I just don't have that kind of time to waste."
