            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

My goal is to support children who have been abused or neglected and offer assistance to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to strengthening relationships and continuous professional development. These core values are not just beneficial to the social work field; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nThroughout my time in high school and college, I witnessed individuals avoid their problems through denial and sometimes employed less than ideal coping mechanisms. This inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, but I remained unsure of my career path. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to reevaluate my options. One summer day, I visited a friend and was introduced to a sixteen-year-old boy who had escaped his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. Wanting to help, I drove to his parents’ house, where I privately discussed my concerns with the police and shared my psychology degree. They asked me to talk to the parents, who were nervous and blamed their son's behavior. This experience made me consider social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value for social work. While society claims to value the individual, we often mourn lost individuals while striving to be like everyone else. I believe in individuality and have protested social injustice throughout my life by coloring my hair unnaturally, dressing in unique clothing, getting multiple piercings, joining the GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I will continue to advocate for social justice.",
            "Every day, I return to my Taipei home, greeted by the sight of Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting/memorizing to someone else.\n\nThis paper tackles the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model dives into genetic information and inherited factors, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their influences on ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into these models, breaking down each piece of research to explain how it connects with the models. The study's findings and explanations are then critiqued for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder is categorized as primary, related to another mental disorder, or related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories include sleep disorders due to medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a challenge in staying awake for a month or more. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders characterized by behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review mainly focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that there are GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor. A problem or absence of this receptor could impact sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and receptor alterations would naturally disturb sleep, affecting aspects of life such as school, career, and daily tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. Secondly, it explains the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags\". Lastly, it concludes with strategies for teachers to support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), often referred to as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition that affects the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Essentially, it's a brain condition that hinders the accurate interpretation of sounds, particularly the separation of words from background noise. People with CAPD can hear perfectly well but struggle with the brain's job of processing and differentiating sounds.\n\nThe first documented mention of this disorder, known as \"auditory imperception\" in the mid-1950s, arose from research on children with communication difficulties. In 1954, an Italian team began developing tests for these children; later, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, which became a model to explain the physiological basis of CANS and dichotic perception. A pivotal national conference in 1977 further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to locate sounds in space, differentiate between similar sounds, recognize sound patterns, discern changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm through tone of voice), have sounds blocked by subsequent sounds, fail to interpret sound clues meaningfully, or misinterpret the sequence of auditory information.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests is required. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using a range of measures, including questionnaires, observations, and more advanced acoustic signal recordings. Currently, no single definitive test or known cause exists for CAPD.",

However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting /memorizing to someone else. Wednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio -  9:00pm! A friend and I arranged to meet at Patio (in the Neo 19 building near  Warner  Village ) at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing. Patio is across the city from my office, so I left 30 minutes before the meeting time... One taxi ride later, I arrived to find out that I had caught my shirt on something and unraveled the bottom hem. Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than salsa-sexy! I ran to the nearest shop (Mango) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?) has increased my dress size, my options are limited. 5 minutes later and with my wallet considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the live salsa band won't start until 10:00 - an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)\n\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade. The topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Having newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261) Although this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. This is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n\nNext Wednesday, I think I'll stay home and dance in front of the mirror to my iTunes collection.",
            "German colonial rule has been notorious for its harshness, especially in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nevertheless, painting an entire colonial empire with one brushstroke is reductive. The German colonial empire varied greatly in its policies and governance, as well as its geographic spread. Educational efforts were similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (present-day Tanzania), they found a considerable population of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies were also admired by contemporary observers. The situation in South West Africa was starkly different. In stark contrast to East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating the natives, the task of native education in South West Africa was primarily left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest heavily in European education, establishing a state school system and actively supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted numerous literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various societal, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors and delve into new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature examining education within the German colonial empire, with most sources originating in German and being written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies. Later works, often in English, expanded on these discussions through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant differences among the educational systems of various colonies. A notable study by Cohen compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing factors that explained the disparities. Cohen attributed many of South West Africa's distinctive educational characteristics to its large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's moderately temperate climate, with substantial arid desert areas, influenced its European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to around 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past 100 years has led to a proliferation of genres that make it challenging to compile a definitive list. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that most, if not all, genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, often skewing towards the darker side. Its diversity lies in its early realization of flexibility, which sparked the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal landscape is so fragmented with niches of groups that it's hard to pinpoint a clear definition of heavy metal itself. It has absorbed themes from other genres, yet it stems from somewhere and understanding its foundation and its movement, rather than just a genre, is crucial.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill - metal bands boast impressive instrumental prowess. Metal is also, unsurprisingly, a movement deeply rooted in drug use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to the creation of wild, other-worldly records, with drugs serving as a catalyst for their production. It possesses dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to the mainstream music that often shied away from the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal also drew inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these from Byrne's \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the dark side of the Beatles, and while it's considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to a heavier song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they included it on \"The White Album.\"",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, doesn't just depict a woman in awe of her dream landscape, but also Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. From the start, he yearned for acceptance, praise, and recognition from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, finding himself at an internal crossroads: to conform to or mimic established styles to gain acceptance, or to remain creatively independent and unique.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" through this lens, one must first know Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). He received no formal art training, instead working as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee) until the age of forty, earning the nickname \"douanier\" (customs inspector) (Shattuck 46). After his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children died, he was left with only one daughter, Julia, and profound grief. He turned to painting for solace and a fresh start, unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in their art.\n\nRousseau's longing for art world acceptance is understandable given his circumstances: he was untrained, began painting late in life, and created works alongside more famous and talented artists. His desire for recognition paralleled that of Henri Matisse, who was gaining reputation around the same time. Jan Gordon, in \"Modern French Painters,\" notes that while they were competitors, they differed in their motivations: Matisse wanted to avoid painting trite art, while Rousseau desired a conventional style to gain admission to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "Many a thinker has pondered the intertwining of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason for this connection. John Keats, in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" aptly puts it: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” While much of what we know comes from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics naturally, without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing than prescribing. We study morality and beauty to understand why something is good or beautiful, rather than to create rules for judging or creating. Criticism of art or morals can never fully capture their essence. Take, for instance, the Mona Lisa. Discussions may focus on foreground, background, contrast, or context, but they don't explain why it's great art. Often, we talk about a favorite piece with phrases like, “There's just something about it,” before delving into more complex explanations. I believe both art and morals can't be fully reduced to descriptions. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” The same goes for ethics. As Wittgenstein puts it, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This transcendent quality—“that je ne sais quoi”—is what makes art and morality powerful. It's this aspect that links them, making them closely related, particularly in literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality... Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany is recognized as a formidable power, a united nation whose rich culture spans from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This culture is felt throughout the country, from Cologne on the Rhine to the center of Germany, and even up to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany, as we know it, is a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a disputed name origin. Scholars and historians debate its source, with Tacitus suggesting it came from the Germanic tribe of Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls he conquered and the Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine. The name might also derive from the spear used in warfare, called a \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" recorded that the Germans were aboriginal, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. In ancient times, people emigrated by ship to Germania, as Rome's lands were more inviting than Germania's wild country, inclement skies, and sullen manners. The Romans would mainly trade with and recruit Germanic tribes for their goods and skills, rather than settle in their lands.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stared down, my mind empty, unemotionally processing the scene before me. With a practiced detachment, I studied the picture, thoughts flickering in and out like they were passing clouds. My awareness was so smooth and clean that it felt like I had no personal thoughts, just a fluid experience of what I was seeing. I had been advised to buy \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" by an artist I worked with. This book taught everything from understanding pencils to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to frame any picture with a square, turning complex scenes into simple ones. But that day, I couldn't mentally frame the bowl of fruit in front of me. I was so overwhelmed, I could only stand and gawk. If I had any artistic pretensions, they were being born in this moment, this Work in Brown. My hand, fingers alighting on my chosen tool, tightened and relaxed as I passed it through space, giving form to my will. Water swirled, clear and calm, flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. Muscles tensed anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The stubborn brown package wouldn't budge. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, then my hand moved towards the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began to wrap itself like a mummy’s bandage. I stood straight, bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….",
            "Every day, young American drivers find themselves in harm's way behind the wheel, making teenage fatalities a grim reality. The National Institutes of Health point to the teen brain's immaturity as a key culprit, making them ill-equipped to handle driving's inherent risks. Inexperience, too, plays a significant role, leading to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents. Teens also face a higher accident rate when driving with peers, a behavior anyone with common sense knows is prevalent.\n\nTo address this, states like California have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, these measures are, in my opinion, a temporary fix. The core issue lies in the fact that, collectively, the youngest drivers struggle to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young to grant a regular driver's license. Zuckerman's research suggests that teenagers under 19-20 often crave thrill-seeking experiences, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency subsides.\n\nIf we continue to license young teens, we'll likely see more deadly accidents and a rising death toll in the coming years. By 2010, the baby boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions will be ready to hit the road.\n\nA logical legislative solution could involve mandating driver's education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, along with required practical driver's training hours. The number of hours could mirror current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult practice.\n\nUniform, national legislation would be a practical and potentially effective way to safeguard teens nationwide, as teenage death rates are consistent across states.\n\nThis proposal is not groundbreaking but aims to address a pressing issue.",
            "I took a dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films and focused on the fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly concentrated on describing the poetic qualities of most trick films and observing the unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films from this period were bound within a stage-like frame, used a frontal proscenium, had no camera movement, and adhered to the one-shot-per-film approach. However, some films dared to break these rules by introducing multi-shot techniques. A common thread among these films is their setting within an interior stage, often drawing inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. The lack of camera movement means actors typically move side-to-side, rarely walking towards or away from the camera, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Long and medium shots are prevalent, with close-ups never appearing, mirroring the theatre tradition where the entire performance is visible at once. Most early trick films follow the one-shot=one-film rule, keeping their length to about a minute or less, and focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks. However, a closer look reveals that a single conceptual shot can be made up of multiple physical shots joined together to create illusions, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895).",
            "John Taylor, associated with Caroline, was a staunch early advocate for Republicanism, despite primarily being an agriculturalist. His political involvement and agricultural roots fostered a deep commitment to personal liberties and governmental structures. His agrarian perspective heavily influenced his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system. He was passionate about preserving and promoting agriculture, which he deemed superior among all professions.\n\nJohn believed the United States held a unique opportunity to establish a flawless government, as it lacked native traditions that might hinder such a system. He strongly upheld the natural rights of man, emphasizing their interdependence; denying any one right would diminish all others. These rights, he argued, should be protected from government interference. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a place where the strong and cunning prospered, but in civilization, this dynamic should be moderated.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in human nature. He was steadfast in his dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He deemed good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function equitably, despite inevitable human self-interest. Self-interest, he maintained, was natural but harmful when it led to sub-societal exploitation. A robust government was necessary to control this innate evil, but it too required oversight to prevent the introduction of corrupt principles.\n\nTaylor, like many contemporaries, called for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He advocated for a minimal Federal government with no powers beyond those explicitly stated, recognizing that an expansive Federal system could become tyrannical. However, he also warned that a literal, unreflective interpretation could degenerate into corruption. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was quite disheartening, and the reason for it is unclear. The onset of winter in a New England campus could be one factor, as fewer people commute by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, with everyone busy with final schoolwork and grading, causing the commuter log to be overlooked. The holiday season also brings a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January, which might also explain the low submissions for that month. However, February's low numbers are puzzling. It's possible that projects like this initially attract a burst of enthusiasm, which then naturally fades. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. One challenge we faced was maintaining project momentum in the face of natural engagement decline, holiday breaks, and semester holidays. Another challenge is that people deeply value the freedom and independence of driving their cars, making it crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting. We provided gift certificates to local businesses as prizes, but it would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have boosted participation. The value of the prizes didn't change during the project, but increasing their value over time, such as announcing a couple of bicycles in December, a hybrid car in January, might have increased engagement instead of decreasing it.",

            "One of Edgar Allan Poe’s most-celebrated works is “Dream-Land.” In this poem, Poe employs the term “Thulé” in the sixth and fifty-sixth lines, which Mabbott attributes to Virgil's usage. Virgil used “Thulé” to denote an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil did indeed use the term, a more contemporary influence is noteworthy. Poe was deeply interested in German literature.\n\nThis connection is significant as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between Poe and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was probably imitating Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe’s death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who loses his wife and subsequently his will to live, mirroring a dark, drinking-addled doppelganger of Poe's own suffering.\n\nPoe references “Thulé” twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses the phrase \"ultma Thulé,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term twice as bookends for the poem. “The King of Thulé” and “Dream-Land” can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, with a shaded world devoid of color—scenes that echo Goethe's poem where the king, after losing his wife, becomes isolated and loses his will to live. The entire poem appears as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s narrative.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known even if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe’s respect for Tennyson would naturally have led him to Goethe's works, given the many reproductions of Goethe's writings that were circulating after their initial publication.",
            "Under California law, could a customer injured by slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager acted with malice? The manager was informed of the spill twice and failed to clean it for half an hour while eating dinner. A judge might not dismiss the claim right away, but the plaintiff would need to prove the manager's actions were done with conscious disregard for the potential harm and were particularly despicable. The store had seen multiple slip-and-fall incidents before, yet the manager did nothing to ensure safety. On October 13, 2009, Rich Wayne reported the spill, but the manager, Paul Martin, was on dinner break and didn't have time for \"customer complaints.\" Later, Mary J. Haddigan reported the spill again, but Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, injuring her back. Five similar incidents had occurred in 2009. Palmer is suing for damages, and we're considering a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim. California law allows punitive damages for actions with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The manager's actions could be considered malicious if he was aware of the risk but deliberately ignored it. So, could the manager's actions be deemed despicable enough to warrant punitive damages?",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC, where we frequently debated whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels more pertinent today than ever, especially considering the media's swing from antagonistic views post-9/11 to an extreme form of tolerance in America. In 2001, the idea of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim lineage, was unimaginable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography, as I understand it, presents a figure who contradicts the historical accounts of his actions. While historical records suggest he conquered tribes and forced them to convert to Islam, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbly converted people through his teachings. This narrative echoes the ministries and miracles of Jesus, with stories of multiplying food to feed multitudes, aiming to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove his teachings but simply lived them. This approach diminishes the life and miracles of Jesus, effectively stealing and crediting Muhammad's attributes to Christ. The biography also relies heavily on third-party accounts, which, while purporting to validate the stories, often diminish their credibility. What bothers me most is the effort to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure, depicting him as humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical facts contradict this portrayal, raising questions about how Muslims today view Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they were established during his lifetime, quickly became overshadowed in the evolution of Christian thought following his passing. When we examine the broader picture of Christianity's history, we observe a persistent drift away from its origins. The world today is increasingly aware and progressive, with traditionalists who resist new ideas making up a smaller and smaller part of the population. Among Christians, historical consciousness will grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a strong desire to differentiate between the doctrines that were added over time and the actual teachings of Jesus. This shift may take several decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable: Christianity will revert to its original form. A movement will emerge, peeling away layers of doctrine one by one, like rewinding time, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire masses to worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering strictly to his teachings. The church will remain a strong institution guiding this process. However, as the theological clock turns backward, the current diversity within Christendom will give way to more uniformity in belief and practice. Differences between regions, denominations, and divisions will diminish, with similarities increasing. History is filled with such reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian realm. Our country has evolved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. This great reversal in Christian history will occur, undoing diversity to find the source, and reducing divisions to a common faith. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what has changed since Jesus' time? Looking back through history, we find only Judaism, the original foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was divided into various sects: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle, in essence, exposes the inherent greed and self-interest that lies within human nature. Individuals are driven to prioritize their own well-being above all else, rarely considering those less fortunate. The story illustrates this through the owners and managers of the immense factories, their only concern being the growth and prosperity of their businesses. They disregard any obstacles or collateral damage, indicated by Sinclair's vivid description: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The factory owners show no regard for the environmental impact or the plight of those affected by the pollution. They also disregard their employees' welfare, pushing them to work grueling hours to maximize profits, as Sinclair puts it, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" With little to no worker protection laws or regulations, managers and owners exploit their employees, often laying off vast numbers without notice or compensation. The workers, trapped in this system, are likened to slaves, enduring horrendous conditions both in and out of the factories. The lack of aid or information for these workers, coupled with ineffective unions, leaves them at the mercy of their oppressors.",
            "Many writers employ various strategies to evoke certain emotions or attitudes about significant topics. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Sometimes, he pairs unusual adjectives with nouns to create a specific atmosphere around a topic. Other times, he assigns meaning to symbols and uses them to achieve the same goal. Fitzgerald frequently uses colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink in this manner. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" he invests meaning into white/gray and red/pink, then employs these meanings to remind readers of feelings connected to important objects.\n\nThe associations Fitzgerald establishes with white/gray are uniformity, with white being associated with higher class and gray with aging and faded prestige. Throughout the novel, he reinforces these connections. Daisy and Jordan are often seen in white, and even Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, while Tom sports a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only exception is when Nick first observes Gatsby's party, where the halls are filled with vibrant primary colors. Fitzgerald further emphasizes these colors by describing mundane subjects in these hues: Nick descends \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the guests at Gatsby's parties appear as \"gray names\" on his schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" all signifying uniformity. He also uses white and gray to depict ordinary people or places, such as the \"white girlhood\" of Daisy and Jordan, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray\" Italian child and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with these meanings, he employs them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence, Fitzgerald describes Daisy in white, making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform, desired object for Gatsby. He reinforces this impression by describing her \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her white dress during Tom and Gatsby's encounter, diminishing her significance as a character.",
            "San Diego County is a farming paradise, basking in its mild, sunny climate. Its fertile soil produces an array of crops, from tomatoes and citrus to leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture here is robust, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waitlists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms also offer tours, hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, allowing landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and creating new revenue streams through tours and educational programs. This farming model could be a profitable endeavor, but it's not without its challenges. Organic farming requires more labor and management to handle pests, weeds, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and yields can be lower compared to conventional methods. Additionally, the landowner might seek financial assistance to maximize profits and improve habitat quality, as the area is home to numerous threatened and endangered species. The land in question is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, home to more than a hundred species, many of which are endangered. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. This property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for decades. The current landowner researched available government programs and organic farms in the area to explore potential cost-mitigating and wildlife-friendly farming opportunities.",
            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by culture, which is both what it is and what it’s not, and what it signifies. Culture isn’t uniform, so statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are too broad. It’s more productive for a negotiator to understand the impact of a culture on the topic at hand and how it will affect negotiations. Approaching a foreign culture involves relating it to one’s own, which can lead to comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture may involve studying its history or recognizing its biases, rather than judging or attempting to change it. It's important to accept a culture as it is and work within its boundaries, especially when one has a weaker bargaining position or is on \"away\" territory. Respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance negotiations.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences. Many companies within a nation have their own corporate cultures, which can include long or flexible hours, direct or indirect communication styles, and diverse hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it. Looking at differences among American companies can illustrate the range of corporate cultures. Even cultures that seem uniform may conceal deeper differences.\n\nValues are crucial to understand because they give context to a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator won’t publicly shame their company or superior. Similarly, someone from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain won't settle early. Before heading to the negotiation table, it's essential to consider these cultural values. Additionally, learning about the personal aspects of the opposing negotiator can enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "“The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This sentiment appears first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the starting point for St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. Likewise, Thomas Aquinas shares this belief. Both authors are defending the same concept, so for the sake of brevity, let's assume they are both right about the God of the Bible. To fairly compare their arguments, we must presume the existence of the God they believe in, as their arguments are aimed at proving this specific deity. However, neither provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this, we'll first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. He suggests gaining understanding through faith, searching within ourselves for proof of God. He claims that since God exists in our understanding, we can't conceive of his non-existence. While his explanation can be convoluted, the core idea is that God's existence is found within our own minds. He implies that no external evidence is needed. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, believes in proving God's existence through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. This approach could aid in evangelism by persuading people with logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he shows that the proof of God lies in logical necessity. If you know you're missing one puzzle piece, you can infer its existence and features without seeing it.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince named Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly affairs and attained enlightenment, founding Buddhism, which is now the most traditional sect known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion has been around for roughly 2,500 years and has evolved quite a bit since Buddha's time. For example, in the Theravada country of Sri Lanka, they celebrate an annual water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ritual, which holds spiritual significance despite Buddha never teaching about such a ceremony. These transformations are evident across the board, from superficial customs to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada community, whether from the monastic or lay perspective, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, both hostile and benign.\n\nThere are several key terms we'll use throughout this discussion: internal versus external forces. An internal force is any influence from Buddhists, regardless of their monastic status. An external force is any influence from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, while benign forces are those that do not wish to harm or help the community, although they might do so inadvertently. These terms will be used frequently.\n\nTo understand Theravada Buddhism, it's important to explore its core principles. Buddhists find refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the Three Baskets, of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which leads to the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laypeople and monks alike. Laypeople must adhere to five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances. Monks have many more rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrine is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to end suffering.",
            "America and Mexico, once locked in a heated rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, provide a classic example of such disputes. The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where America emerged victorious, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. Numerous skirmishes occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing before the First World War. This rivalry was fueled by disagreements on religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).",

I was a nurse, having chosen this career to ensure a secure future, as I'd heard, \"people will always get sick\" from my adolescence onwards. My dream was to be a scientist or journalist, but nursing promised stability.\n\nNow, at 46 and single, I'm disabled, relying on Social Security Disability after 15 years, with nothing left to call my own.

            "The question arises: why do organisms evolve as they do, and are there any constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary change? While in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson suggested that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, the same holds true today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both through ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help us understand the mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. Using X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that we entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a temporal tube that winds through 360 degrees of space. These turns or coils are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, called the body whorl, is the last one. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip and the base being the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different directions: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first, view the shell from the apical perspective and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have been relatively stagnant over the past decade. Despite making significant strides in achieving the Millennium Development Goals like water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health remains insufficient. This highlights a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on targeted interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has increased the proportion of births attended by skilled health workers to 72%, this category still includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions for complicated pregnancies. As such, the maternal death rate due to hemorrhage remains high. Additionally, the percentage of children under five receiving treatment for diarrheal diseases by a health professional has declined, and postnatal care data indicates this is a concern.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected at around 4%, with significant disparities between urban (7%) and rural (2%) areas. This disparity underscores the inequitable access to healthcare services, which are predominantly centered in urban areas. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access healthcare services due to affordability issues.\n\nIn addressing the improvements needed for neonatal and maternal care, the key question is how best to tackle the lack of healthcare services. Should Indonesia focus on programmatic interventions or strengthen the entire health system, including pre- and post-pregnancy care? While program-specific approaches can offer manageable, targeted objectives and quicker results, they often come with drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can divert funding and human resources from other sectors, leading to duplication of services and increased paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels diverge from the typical Victorian style by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which enriches the characters and deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\n“A storm of bewildering and confusing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to be walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing heatedly. The very words they spoke echoed in his ears, and when he tried to focus on his surroundings, he found himself conversing with them. Suddenly, he started at the sound of gunshots. A cacophony of shouts and sounds filled the air, and he felt himself being hurriedly carried away by an unseen force. Through these vivid visions, there was an underlying sensation of pain that gnawed at him constantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth works employ this mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and purpose vary. In Oliver Twist, these dreams often uncover Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and the things that pain him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences the event in a dreamlike state, struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his dire situation, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelm him, his senses numbed, as if he’s removed from the shock of pain, feeling constant fear rather than surprise. The question arises: whose will, then, brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own? This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control and can't even attempt to influence an event's outcome, even as his life hangs in the balance. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, one could assume that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – a day it was not, for it was gone as soon as it came, and night returned, long and yet short. Long in its dreadful silence and brief in its fleeting hours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students in various subjects. While I excelled in English and reading, I was particularly drawn to helping a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. Initially, I couldn't understand why he had peculiar problems with certain letters, some he pronounced perfectly while others were off the mark. Intriguing, he was Latino and spoke perfect English, but his reading comprehension was a challenge. I struggled with him until one day his mother arrived. She didn't speak English, only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That's when it dawned on me: Adrian could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet very well. This revelation shed light on the language barrier issue in schools, especially in California. It's not always as obvious as we think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can be a significant hurdle. We need to address this problem by combining various approaches. In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading and the alphabet was key, but for those barely speaking English, the solution is more complex.\n\nThe dual language system is a great idea, beneficial for students whose first language is Spanish and for all children. Studies show that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. However, many fear that it's a waste of resources and that the majority won't benefit. This is not true. If we made it the norm rather than the exception, all children would thrive. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual, but we could have bilingual aids or tutors to support the students.",
            "From our earliest days, we're often told there exists a realm larger than us, beyond what we can grasp. Some dive into Sunday school, temples, or self-discovery, embracing their parents' faiths, while others reject them, denying any existence beyond our personal world. We may adopt beliefs, only to shift our views, each journey defining our unique spiritual selves. We seek a light to guide us from darkness into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said, when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain pounding on the tin roof, a cigarette in each hand. The gutters poured water, drowning the plants around us. He gazed into the rain, a look that was half search, half reminisce. He'd grown frail, his clothes loose, hair sparse. I felt alone, afraid, unable to discuss my sadness. I hugged him, then sat closer, lost in the rain's dance with the twilight.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation prolonged his agony, but not his life. I couldn't bear to watch him depart. My memories of him were of his living, not his dying. I wasn't there.

            "The quintessential \"Gothic Novel,\" in both its essence and title, is an \"oxymoron of 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt elucidates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both scorned and celebrated, accused of lacking depth yet praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The inaugural \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romance tropes to birth the proto-Gothic genre and a novelistic method. Walpole employed \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to craft his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew from many medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even during the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" encompassed a variety of peoples, styles, and epochs, perceived as archaic or unsophisticated against the backdrop of \"modern\" societal and literary \"progress.\" The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new, reader-focused format ensured the Gothic's longevity, transforming it into both an obsolete and fresh experience for readers displaced in time from the original writing.\n\nOne dominant theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and reimagined in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers, who saw it embodying the quintessential brave, honorable, and competent knight, and who perceived a lack of these qualities in contemporary society. Through chivalric elements and manners, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized (anticipating the evolution to Romanticism), serving as a means to improve the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was immersed in political turmoil and despairing of the future, possibly attributing the supposed moral integrity and \"goodness\" of the gothic era to a perceived loss in contemporary society. This is evident in characters like Frederic. Before meeting him, he embodies traditional chivalric traits, described as: The description includes numerous chivalric images; Frederic is a prince, has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy, and is presumed dead by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of processes that move products from the point of customer order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. The concept was introduced in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a management consultant. He described it as the process of planning, executing, and controlling all activities within the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently. Key components of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to ensure they provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the first critical step in the supply chain. It sets the foundation for the entire process. At this stage, managers determine when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. To understand what customers want, managers can analyze the market, which is the primary indicator of customer demand. Once the demand is understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. After these decisions, they choose the best location for production, considering volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. The next focus is on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Proper planning at this stage is essential to avoid significant delays and expenses in the long run. For instance, I've worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where thorough processes for every aspect of the business ensure smooth operations. A well-designed process layout, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, minimizes confusion and maximizes efficiency.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions to determine the core capabilities of a facility and to establish outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the best division for each production process. They may also decide to outsource some work to other companies to achieve velocity, which is providing quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a piece of cardboard held above her head, the chilling message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta who seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, a series of protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" for the color of the monks' robes, took place. Initially peaceful, they escalated into violent clashes between the monks and the military regime. Foreign journalists were imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed for documenting the protests. The official death toll is disputed, with Colonel Hla Win estimating thousands killed.\n\nThis is hardly new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain total control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, consults weekly with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students and activists were met with a bloody crackdown, with death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically slaughtering Tutsis and political moderates. And let's not forget Hitler's 'Third Reich', a regime that persecuted and killed anyone of Jewish descent.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed to his remarkable longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. As a pianist, his presence is often subtle in many of the compositions, but as a composer, he was exceptional at crafting rich and intricate pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. Ellington designed frameworks that allowed soloists to freely improvise, while also writing tightly orchestrated arrangements that showcased the unique styles of his musicians. This not only emphasized the tone of the entire orchestra but also allowed original sounds to emerge from the collective. Ellington's ability to harness the individual sounds of his players and their collective harmony resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz pieces ever composed.\n\nIn the Grove Music dictionary, the text discusses Ellington's unique sound and innovation, referring to 'Creole Love Call' as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, with its six choruses, demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists throughout his career. In 'Creole Love Call,' the voice is used to add texture and color without lyrics, and the piece features a call and response between voice and reeds, with soloists taking turns on various instruments. The piece culminates in a climactic chorus that showcases the 'growl' technique on the voice, followed by a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending. Ellington's use of voice in this way is a stylistic trait that permeates much of his work.\n\nIn 'Hot and Bothered,' recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration is evident. A call and response between 'Bubber' Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. In 'It Don't Mean a Thing,' Ellington uses 'Tricky Sam' Nanton's muted trombone to great effect, introducing the melody in a way that highlights his unique style.",
            "Ever since she was 14, she had felt a persistent longing for something, yet it remained unfulfilled. At 17, she realized her desire was someone, not something, but no one could capture her interest. Boys were attracted to her, but no one sparked her curiosity. This enigma puzzled her, and years of self-questioning yielded theories but no satisfying answers. She carried on with her life, her curiosity piqued.\n\nA typical day at home was serene.

            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as decreased stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with more monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies had found an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Moreover, an intervention trial revealed that the Med diet outperformed a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not delve into stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 states. Over six follow-ups from 1984 to 2004, an aMed diet score was computed from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) assessing nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses stayed in the study over the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital, or death records.\n\nBody mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed. Cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed to lessen random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake. Adjustments were made for potential confounders like age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, separately for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nThe findings indicated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths (from CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was hit by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market tumbled, and many of America’s most significant and influential corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so it’s essential to examine how it happened and how we can prevent it from recurring. In essence, the financial crisis was sparked by self-centered and naïve political decisions that pushed banks and firms to lend to sub-prime borrowers, flooding an already shaky financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex securities (CDOs and CDS), which failed to withstand the subsequent defaults, spreading economic chaos.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration. President Clinton aimed to secure his second term by boosting his popularity, prompting the administration to loosen lending restrictions. This paved the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, America's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans for low and moderate-income individuals, but also from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes warned, “However, the government-backed corporation could face difficulties in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.” As foreseen, this ill-advised lending led to economic collapse.\n\nA multitude of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the introduction of complex mortgage structures like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and vulnerability to price fluctuations. The housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions, which had invested heavily in these mortgage-backed securities, facing severe financial distress. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. As a result, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",

In movies, exposition occurs when one character shares a lengthy info dump with another, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author does the explaining.\n\nConsider this: As you read a story, you're told the heroine met her love at a specific place and time, they were wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed right before her eyes. You'd expect this sequence to be engaging, with the author spending time on the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to reveal how his presence enriched her life, especially if the story later states that her life changed for the better because of him. A good introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and provide insights into the heroine's persona: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his eyes, and more. You'd mourn his death with her and grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect more than a basic recap: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who used to serve in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. First was NBC 4's live morning show on August 13, 2011. The top story featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. The name of the victim was not mentioned, but his mugshot was shown, depicting what seemed like someone pure evil. They only dedicated about two minutes to this story as it was unfolding. They provided minimal details, simply stating he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I believe they gave this story the right amount of attention.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, and I believe that might be due to the fact that the victim was a minority. I've noticed this before: when a crime involves a minority victim, the media often dedicates less time to it. If a white person is kidnapped or harmed, the media goes into overdrive, but minority victims often barely get a mention.\n\nNext, they covered a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but the length of time dedicated to this story was relatively short. They intended to use it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They seemed to focus unusually on his race and skin color. Another story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" and they mentioned he was Hispanic, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, forged in the fires of shared blood and bound by emotions few understand. Among these feelings are love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers hold each other up as no one else can, seeing in one another their own reflection. This bond is sturdiest in the darkest times, when emotions rise to the surface, good or ill. When a brother looks into his sibling’s eyes, he sees not just a reflection, but his true self laid bare. It is in their actions and the consequences that follow that their true character is revealed. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers navigate the complexities of this bond, with all its emotions. Set against a lush, vivid backdrop, these boys venture on a futile journey, where bitterness and pride clash, and only one survives. This theme is explored through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his older brother, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which paints a picture of Doodle’s complex feelings and the influence they have on his actions.\n\nThe core of Doodle’s actions is pride, from their first outing to their final, fateful adventure. He had envisioned a brother to teach, to adventure with, to race with, but Doodle’s weak heart and frail condition dashed those dreams. Doodle was a constant reminder of the protagonist’s unfulfilled aspirations. Faced with this reality, the protagonist felt resentment and even considered harming Doodle. Yet, a simple smile from his brother could melt his heart, showing his love for Doodle was stronger than his frustrations. This is the struggle of the bond, where love and hate intertwine, understood only by those who share it.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing system. Its metaphors have evolved alongside technology, transitioning from being likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll of papyrus, a book, and finally, a computer. As you delve into brain science, remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can mislead. Information processing commences with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly reconfigure this sensory data through bottom-up and top-down processing.\n\nFor instance, when you gaze at a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to identify the box. Meanwhile, top-down processing hastens recognition by leveraging decisions from preceding bottom-up stages, such as determining the object as a black box rather than a hole. The brain's attention filter then assesses the signal's significance, determining which cognitive processes should engage.\n\nInformation processing is cyclical, with attention modulating results repeatedly. For the brain to process information, storage is necessary, encompassing various memory types: sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies by sensory stimuli; for example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information needs maintenance; working memory, which retains data for about 20 seconds, might be maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory's maintenance is hypothesized to involve protein structures.\n\nBrain knowledge organization models range from human memory retrieval to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits nodes representing concepts interlinked based on relatedness, like \"chair\" linked to \"table\" and \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley, in his dystopian novel Brave New World, warns of the impending dangers of both technology and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. In this society, individuality is suppressed, and people are conditioned from birth to prioritize immediate happiness. The populace is manipulated by the World Controller, who enforces a singular ideology. Through the lens of Marxist theory, one can see Huxley's critique of developing economic systems. Key Marxist terms like homogeny and reification highlight the flaws in the capitalist structure of his time.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism by employing the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Citizens are kept ignorant of their true economic relations, focused solely on personal gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, evident in the emphasis on hypnopædia which reinforces the desire to consume and indulge. The World Controller controls this manipulation, with the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, being entirely unaware of their own exploitation. The upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, also accept their roles, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes demonstrate the oppression inherent in capitalism.\n\nEmotional depth and genuine relationships are absent in Brave New World. Characters lack personal growth, and interactions are superficial, with discussions focusing on physical appearance and sexual encounters. The societal classes' complacency with their roles underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their obedience to their place in the hierarchy reflects Marxist theories about the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and comply.",
            "I've been studying at University Park for about two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge, especially for freshmen like me who were placed in East Halls, the farthest dorms from the center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, for instance, could take up to 25 minutes, and that's without the bad weather that's common here. An alumni I spoke to mentioned that East Halls used to be separated from the rest of the campus by large patches of unused land. Today, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments, making the campus larger and harder to get around. So, what's the solution to this mobility issue? In my opinion, it's cycling, but it's not just about having a bike; the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who had stopped cycling for several years. He said, \"Bikes are great. They're the only way to get around.\" Cycling is not only healthy but also efficient. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. As a student living off campus, I've found the most intelligent decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building is a simple 5-minute ride compared to a 25-minute walk. The only downside is Pollock Road, the direct route from my house to Thomas, which isn't always the easiest to traverse. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option for class, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That's over two and a half hours every week, not to mention the time I'd spend walking to other classes and appointments. That's time I simply can't afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my quest to become a social worker, I aim to focus on the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to support children who have been abused or neglected and offer assistance to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to strengthening relationships and continuous professional development. These core values are not just beneficial to the social work field; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nThroughout my time in high school and college, I witnessed individuals avoid their problems through denial and sometimes employed less than ideal coping mechanisms. This inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, but I remained unsure of my career path. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to reevaluate my options. One summer day, I visited a friend and was introduced to a sixteen-year-old boy who had escaped his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. Wanting to help, I drove to his parents’ house, where I privately discussed my concerns with the police and shared my psychology degree. They asked me to talk to the parents, who were nervous and blamed their son's behavior. This experience made me consider social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value for social work. While society claims to value the individual, we often mourn lost individuals while striving to be like everyone else. I believe in individuality and have protested social injustice throughout my life by coloring my hair unnaturally, dressing in unique clothing, getting multiple piercings, joining the GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I will continue to advocate for social justice.",
            "Every day, I return to my Taipei home, greeted by the sight of Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting/memorizing to someone else.\n\nThis paper tackles the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model dives into genetic information and inherited factors, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their influences on ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into these models, breaking down each piece of research to explain how it connects with the models. The study's findings and explanations are then critiqued for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder is categorized as primary, related to another mental disorder, or related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories include sleep disorders due to medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a challenge in staying awake for a month or more. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders characterized by behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review mainly focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that there are GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor. A problem or absence of this receptor could impact sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and receptor alterations would naturally disturb sleep, affecting aspects of life such as school, career, and daily tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. Secondly, it explains the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags\". Lastly, it concludes with strategies for teachers to support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), often referred to as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition that affects the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Essentially, it's a brain condition that hinders the accurate interpretation of sounds, particularly the separation of words from background noise. People with CAPD can hear perfectly well but struggle with the brain's job of processing and differentiating sounds.\n\nThe first documented mention of this disorder, known as \"auditory imperception\" in the mid-1950s, arose from research on children with communication difficulties. In 1954, an Italian team began developing tests for these children; later, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, which became a model to explain the physiological basis of CANS and dichotic perception. A pivotal national conference in 1977 further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to locate sounds in space, differentiate between similar sounds, recognize sound patterns, discern changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm through tone of voice), have sounds blocked by subsequent sounds, fail to interpret sound clues meaningfully, or misinterpret the sequence of auditory information.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests is required. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using a range of measures, including questionnaires, observations, and more advanced acoustic signal recordings. Currently, no single definitive test or known cause exists for CAPD.",

Wednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio -  9:00pm! A friend and I arranged to meet at Patio (in the Neo 19 building near  Warner  Village ) at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing. Patio is across the city from my office, so I left 30 minutes before the meeting time... One taxi ride later, I arrived to find out that I had caught my shirt on something and unraveled the bottom hem. Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than salsa-sexy! I ran to the nearest shop (Mango) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?) has increased my dress size, my options are limited. 5 minutes later and with my wallet considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the live salsa band won't start until 10:00 - an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)\n\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade. The topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Having newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261) Although this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. This is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n\nNext Wednesday, I think I'll stay home and dance in front of the mirror to my iTunes collection.",
            "German colonial rule has been notorious for its harshness, especially in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nevertheless, painting an entire colonial empire with one brushstroke is reductive. The German colonial empire varied greatly in its policies and governance, as well as its geographic spread. Educational efforts were similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (present-day Tanzania), they found a considerable population of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies were also admired by contemporary observers. The situation in South West Africa was starkly different. In stark contrast to East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating the natives, the task of native education in South West Africa was primarily left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest heavily in European education, establishing a state school system and actively supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted numerous literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various societal, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors and delve into new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature examining education within the German colonial empire, with most sources originating in German and being written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies. Later works, often in English, expanded on these discussions through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant differences among the educational systems of various colonies. A notable study by Cohen compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing factors that explained the disparities. Cohen attributed many of South West Africa's distinctive educational characteristics to its large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's moderately temperate climate, with substantial arid desert areas, influenced its European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to around 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past 100 years has led to a proliferation of genres that make it challenging to compile a definitive list. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that most, if not all, genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, often skewing towards the darker side. Its diversity lies in its early realization of flexibility, which sparked the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal landscape is so fragmented with niches of groups that it's hard to pinpoint a clear definition of heavy metal itself. It has absorbed themes from other genres, yet it stems from somewhere and understanding its foundation and its movement, rather than just a genre, is crucial.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill - metal bands boast impressive instrumental prowess. Metal is also, unsurprisingly, a movement deeply rooted in drug use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to the creation of wild, other-worldly records, with drugs serving as a catalyst for their production. It possesses dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to the mainstream music that often shied away from the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal also drew inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these from Byrne's \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the dark side of the Beatles, and while it's considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to a heavier song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles wanted to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, so they included it on \"The White Album.\"",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, doesn't just depict a woman in awe of her dream landscape, but also Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. From the start, he yearned for acceptance, praise, and recognition from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, finding himself at an internal crossroads: to conform to or mimic established styles to gain acceptance, or to remain creatively independent and unique.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" through this lens, one must first know Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). He received no formal art training, instead working as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee) until the age of forty, earning the nickname \"douanier\" (customs inspector) (Shattuck 46). After his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children died, he was left with only one daughter, Julia, and profound grief. He turned to painting for solace and a fresh start, unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in their art.\n\nRousseau's longing for art world acceptance is understandable given his circumstances: he was untrained, began painting late in life, and created works alongside more famous and talented artists. His desire for recognition paralleled that of Henri Matisse, who was gaining reputation around the same time. Jan Gordon, in \"Modern French Painters,\" notes that while they were competitors, they differed in their motivations: Matisse wanted to avoid painting trite art, while Rousseau desired a conventional style to gain admission to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "Many a thinker has pondered the intertwining of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason for this connection. John Keats, in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" aptly puts it: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” While much of what we know comes from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics naturally, without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing than prescribing. We study morality and beauty to understand why something is good or beautiful, rather than to create rules for judging or creating. Criticism of art or morals can never fully capture their essence. Take, for instance, the Mona Lisa. Discussions may focus on foreground, background, contrast, or context, but they don't explain why it's great art. Often, we talk about a favorite piece with phrases like, “There's just something about it,” before delving into more complex explanations. I believe both art and morals can't be fully reduced to descriptions. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” The same goes for ethics. As Wittgenstein puts it, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This transcendent quality—“that je ne sais quoi”—is what makes art and morality powerful. It's this aspect that links them, making them closely related, particularly in literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality... Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany is recognized as a formidable power, a united nation whose rich culture spans from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This culture is felt throughout the country, from Cologne on the Rhine to the center of Germany, and even up to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany, as we know it, is a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a disputed name origin. Scholars and historians debate its source, with Tacitus suggesting it came from the Germanic tribe of Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls he conquered and the Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine. The name might also derive from the spear used in warfare, called a \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" recorded that the Germans were aboriginal, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. In ancient times, people emigrated by ship to Germania, as Rome's lands were more inviting than Germania's wild country, inclement skies, and sullen manners. The Romans would mainly trade with and recruit Germanic tribes for their goods and skills, rather than settle in their lands.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and serving in the Roman army.",

With a practiced detachment, I studied the picture, thoughts flickering in and out like they were passing clouds. My awareness was so smooth and clean that it felt like I had no personal thoughts, just a fluid experience of what I was seeing. I had been advised to buy \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" by an artist I worked with. This book taught everything from understanding pencils to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to frame any picture with a square, turning complex scenes into simple ones. But that day, I couldn't mentally frame the bowl of fruit in front of me.

A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, then my hand moved towards the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began to wrap itself like a mummy’s bandage.

            "Every day, young American drivers find themselves in harm's way behind the wheel, making teenage fatalities a grim reality. The National Institutes of Health point to the teen brain's immaturity as a key culprit, making them ill-equipped to handle driving's inherent risks. Inexperience, too, plays a significant role, leading to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents. Teens also face a higher accident rate when driving with peers, a behavior anyone with common sense knows is prevalent.\n\nTo address this, states like California have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, these measures are, in my opinion, a temporary fix. The core issue lies in the fact that, collectively, the youngest drivers struggle to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young to grant a regular driver's license. Zuckerman's research suggests that teenagers under 19-20 often crave thrill-seeking experiences, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency subsides.\n\nIf we continue to license young teens, we'll likely see more deadly accidents and a rising death toll in the coming years. By 2010, the baby boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions will be ready to hit the road.\n\nA logical legislative solution could involve mandating driver's education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, along with required practical driver's training hours. The number of hours could mirror current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult practice.\n\nUniform, national legislation would be a practical and potentially effective way to safeguard teens nationwide, as teenage death rates are consistent across states.\n\nThis proposal is not groundbreaking but aims to address a pressing issue.",
            "I took a dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films and focused on the fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly concentrated on describing the poetic qualities of most trick films and observing the unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films from this period were bound within a stage-like frame, used a frontal proscenium, had no camera movement, and adhered to the one-shot-per-film approach. However, some films dared to break these rules by introducing multi-shot techniques. A common thread among these films is their setting within an interior stage, often drawing inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. The lack of camera movement means actors typically move side-to-side, rarely walking towards or away from the camera, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Long and medium shots are prevalent, with close-ups never appearing, mirroring the theatre tradition where the entire performance is visible at once. Most early trick films follow the one-shot=one-film rule, keeping their length to about a minute or less, and focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks. However, a closer look reveals that a single conceptual shot can be made up of multiple physical shots joined together to create illusions, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895).",
            "John Taylor, associated with Caroline, was a staunch early advocate for Republicanism, despite primarily being an agriculturalist. His political involvement and agricultural roots fostered a deep commitment to personal liberties and governmental structures. His agrarian perspective heavily influenced his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system. He was passionate about preserving and promoting agriculture, which he deemed superior among all professions.\n\nJohn believed the United States held a unique opportunity to establish a flawless government, as it lacked native traditions that might hinder such a system. He strongly upheld the natural rights of man, emphasizing their interdependence; denying any one right would diminish all others. These rights, he argued, should be protected from government interference. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a place where the strong and cunning prospered, but in civilization, this dynamic should be moderated.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in human nature. He was steadfast in his dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He deemed good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function equitably, despite inevitable human self-interest. Self-interest, he maintained, was natural but harmful when it led to sub-societal exploitation. A robust government was necessary to control this innate evil, but it too required oversight to prevent the introduction of corrupt principles.\n\nTaylor, like many contemporaries, called for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He advocated for a minimal Federal government with no powers beyond those explicitly stated, recognizing that an expansive Federal system could become tyrannical. However, he also warned that a literal, unreflective interpretation could degenerate into corruption. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was quite disheartening, and the reason for it is unclear. The onset of winter in a New England campus could be one factor, as fewer people commute by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, with everyone busy with final schoolwork and grading, causing the commuter log to be overlooked. The holiday season also brings a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January, which might also explain the low submissions for that month. However, February's low numbers are puzzling. It's possible that projects like this initially attract a burst of enthusiasm, which then naturally fades. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. One challenge we faced was maintaining project momentum in the face of natural engagement decline, holiday breaks, and semester holidays. Another challenge is that people deeply value the freedom and independence of driving their cars, making it crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting. We provided gift certificates to local businesses as prizes, but it would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have boosted participation. The value of the prizes didn't change during the project, but increasing their value over time, such as announcing a couple of bicycles in December, a hybrid car in January, might have increased engagement instead of decreasing it.",
            "Every day, when I return to my Taipei home, I am greeted by Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting /memorizing to someone else.\n\nWednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio - 9:00pm! A friend and I arranged to meet at Patio (in the Neo 19 building near Warner Village) at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing. Patio is across the city from my office, so I left 30 minutes before the meeting time...One taxi ride later, I arrived to find out that I had caught my shirt on something and unravelled the bottom hem. Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than salsa-sexy! I ran to the nearest shop (Mango) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?) has increased my dress size, my options are limited. 5 minutes later and with my wallet considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the live salsa band won't start until 10:00- an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe’s most-celebrated works is “Dream-Land.” In this poem, Poe employs the term “Thulé” in the sixth and fifty-sixth lines, which Mabbott attributes to Virgil's usage. Virgil used “Thulé” to denote an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil did indeed use the term, a more contemporary influence is noteworthy. Poe was deeply interested in German literature.\n\nThis connection is significant as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between Poe and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was probably imitating Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe’s death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who loses his wife and subsequently his will to live, mirroring a dark, drinking-addled doppelganger of Poe's own suffering.\n\nPoe references “Thulé” twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses the phrase \"ultma Thulé,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term twice as bookends for the poem. “The King of Thulé” and “Dream-Land” can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, with a shaded world devoid of color—scenes that echo Goethe's poem where the king, after losing his wife, becomes isolated and loses his will to live. The entire poem appears as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s narrative.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known even if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe’s respect for Tennyson would naturally have led him to Goethe's works, given the many reproductions of Goethe's writings that were circulating after their initial publication.",
            "Under California law, could a customer injured by slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager acted with malice? The manager was informed of the spill twice and failed to clean it for half an hour while eating dinner. A judge might not dismiss the claim right away, but the plaintiff would need to prove the manager's actions were done with conscious disregard for the potential harm and were particularly despicable. The store had seen multiple slip-and-fall incidents before, yet the manager did nothing to ensure safety. On October 13, 2009, Rich Wayne reported the spill, but the manager, Paul Martin, was on dinner break and didn't have time for \"customer complaints.\" Later, Mary J. Haddigan reported the spill again, but Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, injuring her back. Five similar incidents had occurred in 2009. Palmer is suing for damages, and we're considering a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim. California law allows punitive damages for actions with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The manager's actions could be considered malicious if he was aware of the risk but deliberately ignored it. So, could the manager's actions be deemed despicable enough to warrant punitive damages?",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC, where we frequently debated whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels more pertinent today than ever, especially considering the media's swing from antagonistic views post-9/11 to an extreme form of tolerance in America. In 2001, the idea of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim lineage, was unimaginable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography, as I understand it, presents a figure who contradicts the historical accounts of his actions. While historical records suggest he conquered tribes and forced them to convert to Islam, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbly converted people through his teachings. This narrative echoes the ministries and miracles of Jesus, with stories of multiplying food to feed multitudes, aiming to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove his teachings but simply lived them. This approach diminishes the life and miracles of Jesus, effectively stealing and crediting Muhammad's attributes to Christ. The biography also relies heavily on third-party accounts, which, while purporting to validate the stories, often diminish their credibility. What bothers me most is the effort to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure, depicting him as humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical facts contradict this portrayal, raising questions about how Muslims today view Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they were established during his lifetime, quickly became overshadowed in the evolution of Christian thought following his passing. When we examine the broader picture of Christianity's history, we observe a persistent drift away from its origins. The world today is increasingly aware and progressive, with traditionalists who resist new ideas making up a smaller and smaller part of the population. Among Christians, historical consciousness will grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a strong desire to differentiate between the doctrines that were added over time and the actual teachings of Jesus. This shift may take several decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable: Christianity will revert to its original form. A movement will emerge, peeling away layers of doctrine one by one, like rewinding time, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire masses to worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering strictly to his teachings. The church will remain a strong institution guiding this process. However, as the theological clock turns backward, the current diversity within Christendom will give way to more uniformity in belief and practice. Differences between regions, denominations, and divisions will diminish, with similarities increasing. History is filled with such reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian realm. Our country has evolved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. This great reversal in Christian history will occur, undoing diversity to find the source, and reducing divisions to a common faith. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what has changed since Jesus' time? Looking back through history, we find only Judaism, the original foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was divided into various sects: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle, in essence, exposes the inherent greed and self-interest that lies within human nature. Individuals are driven to prioritize their own well-being above all else, rarely considering those less fortunate. The story illustrates this through the owners and managers of the immense factories, their only concern being the growth and prosperity of their businesses. They disregard any obstacles or collateral damage, indicated by Sinclair's vivid description: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The factory owners show no regard for the environmental impact or the plight of those affected by the pollution. They also disregard their employees' welfare, pushing them to work grueling hours to maximize profits, as Sinclair puts it, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" With little to no worker protection laws or regulations, managers and owners exploit their employees, often laying off vast numbers without notice or compensation. The workers, trapped in this system, are likened to slaves, enduring horrendous conditions both in and out of the factories. The lack of aid or information for these workers, coupled with ineffective unions, leaves them at the mercy of their oppressors.",
            "Many writers employ various strategies to evoke certain emotions or attitudes about significant topics. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Sometimes, he pairs unusual adjectives with nouns to create a specific atmosphere around a topic. Other times, he assigns meaning to symbols and uses them to achieve the same goal. Fitzgerald frequently uses colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink in this manner. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" he invests meaning into white/gray and red/pink, then employs these meanings to remind readers of feelings connected to important objects.\n\nThe associations Fitzgerald establishes with white/gray are uniformity, with white being associated with higher class and gray with aging and faded prestige. Throughout the novel, he reinforces these connections. Daisy and Jordan are often seen in white, and even Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, while Tom sports a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only exception is when Nick first observes Gatsby's party, where the halls are filled with vibrant primary colors. Fitzgerald further emphasizes these colors by describing mundane subjects in these hues: Nick descends \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the guests at Gatsby's parties appear as \"gray names\" on his schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" all signifying uniformity. He also uses white and gray to depict ordinary people or places, such as the \"white girlhood\" of Daisy and Jordan, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray\" Italian child and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with these meanings, he employs them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence, Fitzgerald describes Daisy in white, making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform, desired object for Gatsby. He reinforces this impression by describing her \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her white dress during Tom and Gatsby's encounter, diminishing her significance as a character.",
            "San Diego County is a farming paradise, basking in its mild, sunny climate. Its fertile soil produces an array of crops, from tomatoes and citrus to leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture here is robust, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waitlists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms also offer tours, hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, allowing landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and creating new revenue streams through tours and educational programs. This farming model could be a profitable endeavor, but it's not without its challenges. Organic farming requires more labor and management to handle pests, weeds, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and yields can be lower compared to conventional methods. Additionally, the landowner might seek financial assistance to maximize profits and improve habitat quality, as the area is home to numerous threatened and endangered species. The land in question is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, home to more than a hundred species, many of which are endangered. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. This property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for decades. The current landowner researched available government programs and organic farms in the area to explore potential cost-mitigating and wildlife-friendly farming opportunities.",
            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by culture, which is both what it is and what it’s not, and what it signifies. Culture isn’t uniform, so statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are too broad. It’s more productive for a negotiator to understand the impact of a culture on the topic at hand and how it will affect negotiations. Approaching a foreign culture involves relating it to one’s own, which can lead to comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture may involve studying its history or recognizing its biases, rather than judging or attempting to change it. It's important to accept a culture as it is and work within its boundaries, especially when one has a weaker bargaining position or is on \"away\" territory. Respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance negotiations.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences. Many companies within a nation have their own corporate cultures, which can include long or flexible hours, direct or indirect communication styles, and diverse hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it. Looking at differences among American companies can illustrate the range of corporate cultures. Even cultures that seem uniform may conceal deeper differences.\n\nValues are crucial to understand because they give context to a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator won’t publicly shame their company or superior. Similarly, someone from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain won't settle early. Before heading to the negotiation table, it's essential to consider these cultural values. Additionally, learning about the personal aspects of the opposing negotiator can enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "“The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This sentiment appears first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the starting point for St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. Likewise, Thomas Aquinas shares this belief. Both authors are defending the same concept, so for the sake of brevity, let's assume they are both right about the God of the Bible. To fairly compare their arguments, we must presume the existence of the God they believe in, as their arguments are aimed at proving this specific deity. However, neither provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this, we'll first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. He suggests gaining understanding through faith, searching within ourselves for proof of God. He claims that since God exists in our understanding, we can't conceive of his non-existence. While his explanation can be convoluted, the core idea is that God's existence is found within our own minds. He implies that no external evidence is needed. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, believes in proving God's existence through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. This approach could aid in evangelism by persuading people with logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he shows that the proof of God lies in logical necessity. If you know you're missing one puzzle piece, you can infer its existence and features without seeing it.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince named Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly affairs and attained enlightenment, founding Buddhism, which is now the most traditional sect known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion has been around for roughly 2,500 years and has evolved quite a bit since Buddha's time. For example, in the Theravada country of Sri Lanka, they celebrate an annual water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ritual, which holds spiritual significance despite Buddha never teaching about such a ceremony. These transformations are evident across the board, from superficial customs to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada community, whether from the monastic or lay perspective, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, both hostile and benign.\n\nThere are several key terms we'll use throughout this discussion: internal versus external forces. An internal force is any influence from Buddhists, regardless of their monastic status. An external force is any influence from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, while benign forces are those that do not wish to harm or help the community, although they might do so inadvertently. These terms will be used frequently.\n\nTo understand Theravada Buddhism, it's important to explore its core principles. Buddhists find refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the Three Baskets, of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which leads to the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laypeople and monks alike. Laypeople must adhere to five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances. Monks have many more rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrine is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to end suffering.",
            "America and Mexico, once locked in a heated rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, provide a classic example of such disputes. The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where America emerged victorious, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. Numerous skirmishes occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing before the First World War. This rivalry was fueled by disagreements on religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).",

            "The question arises: why do organisms evolve as they do, and are there any constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary change? While in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson suggested that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, the same holds true today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both through ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help us understand the mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. Using X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that we entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a temporal tube that winds through 360 degrees of space. These turns or coils are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, called the body whorl, is the last one. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip and the base being the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different directions: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first, view the shell from the apical perspective and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have been relatively stagnant over the past decade. Despite making significant strides in achieving the Millennium Development Goals like water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health remains insufficient. This highlights a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on targeted interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has increased the proportion of births attended by skilled health workers to 72%, this category still includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions for complicated pregnancies. As such, the maternal death rate due to hemorrhage remains high. Additionally, the percentage of children under five receiving treatment for diarrheal diseases by a health professional has declined, and postnatal care data indicates this is a concern.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected at around 4%, with significant disparities between urban (7%) and rural (2%) areas. This disparity underscores the inequitable access to healthcare services, which are predominantly centered in urban areas. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access healthcare services due to affordability issues.\n\nIn addressing the improvements needed for neonatal and maternal care, the key question is how best to tackle the lack of healthcare services. Should Indonesia focus on programmatic interventions or strengthen the entire health system, including pre- and post-pregnancy care? While program-specific approaches can offer manageable, targeted objectives and quicker results, they often come with drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can divert funding and human resources from other sectors, leading to duplication of services and increased paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels diverge from the typical Victorian style by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which enriches the characters and deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\n“A storm of bewildering and confusing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to be walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing heatedly. The very words they spoke echoed in his ears, and when he tried to focus on his surroundings, he found himself conversing with them. Suddenly, he started at the sound of gunshots. A cacophony of shouts and sounds filled the air, and he felt himself being hurriedly carried away by an unseen force. Through these vivid visions, there was an underlying sensation of pain that gnawed at him constantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth works employ this mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and purpose vary. In Oliver Twist, these dreams often uncover Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and the things that pain him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences the event in a dreamlike state, struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his dire situation, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelm him, his senses numbed, as if he’s removed from the shock of pain, feeling constant fear rather than surprise. The question arises: whose will, then, brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own? This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control and can't even attempt to influence an event's outcome, even as his life hangs in the balance. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, one could assume that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – a day it was not, for it was gone as soon as it came, and night returned, long and yet short. Long in its dreadful silence and brief in its fleeting hours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students in various subjects. While I excelled in English and reading, I was particularly drawn to helping a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. Initially, I couldn't understand why he had peculiar problems with certain letters, some he pronounced perfectly while others were off the mark. Intriguing, he was Latino and spoke perfect English, but his reading comprehension was a challenge. I struggled with him until one day his mother arrived. She didn't speak English, only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That's when it dawned on me: Adrian could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet very well. This revelation shed light on the language barrier issue in schools, especially in California. It's not always as obvious as we think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can be a significant hurdle. We need to address this problem by combining various approaches. In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading and the alphabet was key, but for those barely speaking English, the solution is more complex.\n\nThe dual language system is a great idea, beneficial for students whose first language is Spanish and for all children. Studies show that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. However, many fear that it's a waste of resources and that the majority won't benefit. This is not true. If we made it the norm rather than the exception, all children would thrive. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual, but we could have bilingual aids or tutors to support the students.",
            "From our earliest days, we're often told there exists a realm larger than us, beyond what we can grasp. Some dive into Sunday school, temples, or self-discovery, embracing their parents' faiths, while others reject them, denying any existence beyond our personal world. We may adopt beliefs, only to shift our views, each journey defining our unique spiritual selves. We seek a light to guide us from darkness into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said, when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain pounding on the tin roof, a cigarette in each hand. The gutters poured water, drowning the plants around us. He gazed into the rain, a look that was half search, half reminisce. He'd grown frail, his clothes loose, hair sparse. I felt alone, afraid, unable to discuss my sadness. I hugged him, then sat closer, lost in the rain's dance with the twilight.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation prolonged his agony, but not his life. I couldn't bear to watch him depart. My memories of him were of his living, not his dying. I wasn't there. I hid in my bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called.",
            "The quintessential \"Gothic Novel,\" in both its essence and title, is an \"oxymoron of 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt elucidates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both scorned and celebrated, accused of lacking depth yet praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The inaugural \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romance tropes to birth the proto-Gothic genre and a novelistic method. Walpole employed \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to craft his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew from many medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even during the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" encompassed a variety of peoples, styles, and epochs, perceived as archaic or unsophisticated against the backdrop of \"modern\" societal and literary \"progress.\" The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new, reader-focused format ensured the Gothic's longevity, transforming it into both an obsolete and fresh experience for readers displaced in time from the original writing.\n\nOne dominant theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and reimagined in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers, who saw it embodying the quintessential brave, honorable, and competent knight, and who perceived a lack of these qualities in contemporary society. Through chivalric elements and manners, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized (anticipating the evolution to Romanticism), serving as a means to improve the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was immersed in political turmoil and despairing of the future, possibly attributing the supposed moral integrity and \"goodness\" of the gothic era to a perceived loss in contemporary society. This is evident in characters like Frederic. Before meeting him, he embodies traditional chivalric traits, described as: The description includes numerous chivalric images; Frederic is a prince, has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy, and is presumed dead by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of processes that move products from the point of customer order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. The concept was introduced in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a management consultant. He described it as the process of planning, executing, and controlling all activities within the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently. Key components of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to ensure they provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the first critical step in the supply chain. It sets the foundation for the entire process. At this stage, managers determine when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. To understand what customers want, managers can analyze the market, which is the primary indicator of customer demand. Once the demand is understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. After these decisions, they choose the best location for production, considering volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. The next focus is on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Proper planning at this stage is essential to avoid significant delays and expenses in the long run. For instance, I've worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where thorough processes for every aspect of the business ensure smooth operations. A well-designed process layout, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, minimizes confusion and maximizes efficiency.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions to determine the core capabilities of a facility and to establish outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the best division for each production process. They may also decide to outsource some work to other companies to achieve velocity, which is providing quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a piece of cardboard held above her head, the chilling message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta who seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, a series of protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" for the color of the monks' robes, took place. Initially peaceful, they escalated into violent clashes between the monks and the military regime. Foreign journalists were imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed for documenting the protests. The official death toll is disputed, with Colonel Hla Win estimating thousands killed.\n\nThis is hardly new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain total control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, consults weekly with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students and activists were met with a bloody crackdown, with death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically slaughtering Tutsis and political moderates. And let's not forget Hitler's 'Third Reich', a regime that persecuted and killed anyone of Jewish descent.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed to his remarkable longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. As a pianist, his presence is often subtle in many of the compositions, but as a composer, he was exceptional at crafting rich and intricate pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. Ellington designed frameworks that allowed soloists to freely improvise, while also writing tightly orchestrated arrangements that showcased the unique styles of his musicians. This not only emphasized the tone of the entire orchestra but also allowed original sounds to emerge from the collective. Ellington's ability to harness the individual sounds of his players and their collective harmony resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz pieces ever composed.\n\nIn the Grove Music dictionary, the text discusses Ellington's unique sound and innovation, referring to 'Creole Love Call' as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, with its six choruses, demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists throughout his career. In 'Creole Love Call,' the voice is used to add texture and color without lyrics, and the piece features a call and response between voice and reeds, with soloists taking turns on various instruments. The piece culminates in a climactic chorus that showcases the 'growl' technique on the voice, followed by a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending. Ellington's use of voice in this way is a stylistic trait that permeates much of his work.\n\nIn 'Hot and Bothered,' recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration is evident. A call and response between 'Bubber' Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. In 'It Don't Mean a Thing,' Ellington uses 'Tricky Sam' Nanton's muted trombone to great effect, introducing the melody in a way that highlights his unique style.",
            "Ever since she was 14, she had felt a persistent longing for something, yet it remained unfulfilled. At 17, she realized her desire was someone, not something, but no one could capture her interest. Boys were attracted to her, but no one sparked her curiosity. This enigma puzzled her, and years of self-questioning yielded theories but no satisfying answers. She carried on with her life, her curiosity piqued.\n\nA typical day at home was serene. Her parents were calm, seldom arguing, and their daughter was a lively blend of their serenity and her own exuberance, making her well-liked. Yet, today was anything but calm. As she wandered through the house seeking inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother was on the ground, gasping \"Ow.\" Panicked, she rushed to her side. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother, in pain, asked her to take her to the hospital. \"Where should I pick you up?\" she asked, guiding her hands. Strengthened by her classes, she carried her mother to the car and drove.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent and her mother's pain filled her with fear, but she focused on helping. Carrying her mother in, she called for help, and doctors arrived to examine her. Her mother had fallen from a stool, attempting to reach a vase. She was left to sit, worried, as her mother was taken away.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as decreased stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with more monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies had found an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Moreover, an intervention trial revealed that the Med diet outperformed a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not delve into stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 states. Over six follow-ups from 1984 to 2004, an aMed diet score was computed from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) assessing nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses stayed in the study over the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital, or death records.\n\nBody mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed. Cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed to lessen random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake. Adjustments were made for potential confounders like age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, separately for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nThe findings indicated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths (from CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was hit by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market tumbled, and many of America’s most significant and influential corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so it’s essential to examine how it happened and how we can prevent it from recurring. In essence, the financial crisis was sparked by self-centered and naïve political decisions that pushed banks and firms to lend to sub-prime borrowers, flooding an already shaky financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex securities (CDOs and CDS), which failed to withstand the subsequent defaults, spreading economic chaos.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration. President Clinton aimed to secure his second term by boosting his popularity, prompting the administration to loosen lending restrictions. This paved the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, America's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans for low and moderate-income individuals, but also from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes warned, “However, the government-backed corporation could face difficulties in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.” As foreseen, this ill-advised lending led to economic collapse.\n\nA multitude of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the introduction of complex mortgage structures like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and vulnerability to price fluctuations. The housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions, which had invested heavily in these mortgage-backed securities, facing severe financial distress. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. As a result, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That's the part of your story where you spread your writing wings and take flight, enthralling readers with your spellbinding prose. Or the bit where your audience falls asleep or hits the \"Back\" button, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she stumbles upon Too Much Information, and not even the good kind.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself stuck in endless stretches of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is that little demon on your shoulder whispering that you should get the background info out of the way to reach the good stuff (not to be confused with the demon urging you to share every mundane detail of your characters' lives).\n\nExposition means informing your audience about what happened, often in plain language. In movies, exposition occurs when one character shares a lengthy info dump with another, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author does the explaining.\n\nConsider this: As you read a story, you're told the heroine met her love at a specific place and time, they were wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed right before her eyes. You'd expect this sequence to be engaging, with the author spending time on the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to reveal how his presence enriched her life, especially if the story later states that her life changed for the better because of him. A good introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and provide insights into the heroine's persona: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his eyes, and more. You'd mourn his death with her and grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect more than a basic recap: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that depth. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who used to serve in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. First was NBC 4's live morning show on August 13, 2011. The top story featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. The name of the victim was not mentioned, but his mugshot was shown, depicting what seemed like someone pure evil. They only dedicated about two minutes to this story as it was unfolding. They provided minimal details, simply stating he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I believe they gave this story the right amount of attention.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, and I believe that might be due to the fact that the victim was a minority. I've noticed this before: when a crime involves a minority victim, the media often dedicates less time to it. If a white person is kidnapped or harmed, the media goes into overdrive, but minority victims often barely get a mention.\n\nNext, they covered a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but the length of time dedicated to this story was relatively short. They intended to use it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They seemed to focus unusually on his race and skin color. Another story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" and they mentioned he was Hispanic, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, forged in the fires of shared blood and bound by emotions few understand. Among these feelings are love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers hold each other up as no one else can, seeing in one another their own reflection. This bond is sturdiest in the darkest times, when emotions rise to the surface, good or ill. When a brother looks into his sibling’s eyes, he sees not just a reflection, but his true self laid bare. It is in their actions and the consequences that follow that their true character is revealed. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers navigate the complexities of this bond, with all its emotions. Set against a lush, vivid backdrop, these boys venture on a futile journey, where bitterness and pride clash, and only one survives. This theme is explored through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his older brother, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which paints a picture of Doodle’s complex feelings and the influence they have on his actions.\n\nThe core of Doodle’s actions is pride, from their first outing to their final, fateful adventure. He had envisioned a brother to teach, to adventure with, to race with, but Doodle’s weak heart and frail condition dashed those dreams. Doodle was a constant reminder of the protagonist’s unfulfilled aspirations. Faced with this reality, the protagonist felt resentment and even considered harming Doodle. Yet, a simple smile from his brother could melt his heart, showing his love for Doodle was stronger than his frustrations. This is the struggle of the bond, where love and hate intertwine, understood only by those who share it.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing system. Its metaphors have evolved alongside technology, transitioning from being likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll of papyrus, a book, and finally, a computer. As you delve into brain science, remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can mislead. Information processing commences with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly reconfigure this sensory data through bottom-up and top-down processing.\n\nFor instance, when you gaze at a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to identify the box. Meanwhile, top-down processing hastens recognition by leveraging decisions from preceding bottom-up stages, such as determining the object as a black box rather than a hole. The brain's attention filter then assesses the signal's significance, determining which cognitive processes should engage.\n\nInformation processing is cyclical, with attention modulating results repeatedly. For the brain to process information, storage is necessary, encompassing various memory types: sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies by sensory stimuli; for example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information needs maintenance; working memory, which retains data for about 20 seconds, might be maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory's maintenance is hypothesized to involve protein structures.\n\nBrain knowledge organization models range from human memory retrieval to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits nodes representing concepts interlinked based on relatedness, like \"chair\" linked to \"table\" and \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley, in his dystopian novel Brave New World, warns of the impending dangers of both technology and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. In this society, individuality is suppressed, and people are conditioned from birth to prioritize immediate happiness. The populace is manipulated by the World Controller, who enforces a singular ideology. Through the lens of Marxist theory, one can see Huxley's critique of developing economic systems. Key Marxist terms like homogeny and reification highlight the flaws in the capitalist structure of his time.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism by employing the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Citizens are kept ignorant of their true economic relations, focused solely on personal gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, evident in the emphasis on hypnopædia which reinforces the desire to consume and indulge. The World Controller controls this manipulation, with the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, being entirely unaware of their own exploitation. The upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, also accept their roles, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes demonstrate the oppression inherent in capitalism.\n\nEmotional depth and genuine relationships are absent in Brave New World. Characters lack personal growth, and interactions are superficial, with discussions focusing on physical appearance and sexual encounters. The societal classes' complacency with their roles underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their obedience to their place in the hierarchy reflects Marxist theories about the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and comply.",
            "I've been studying at University Park for about two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge, especially for freshmen like me who were placed in East Halls, the farthest dorms from the center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, for instance, could take up to 25 minutes, and that's without the bad weather that's common here. An alumni I spoke to mentioned that East Halls used to be separated from the rest of the campus by large patches of unused land. Today, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments, making the campus larger and harder to get around. So, what's the solution to this mobility issue? In my opinion, it's cycling, but it's not just about having a bike; the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who had stopped cycling for several years. He said, \"Bikes are great. They're the only way to get around.\" Cycling is not only healthy but also efficient. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. As a student living off campus, I've found the most intelligent decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building is a simple 5-minute ride compared to a 25-minute walk. The only downside is Pollock Road, the direct route from my house to Thomas, which isn't always the easiest to traverse. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option for class, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That's over two and a half hours every week, not to mention the time I'd spend walking to other classes and appointments. That's time I simply can't afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my quest to become a social worker, I aim to focus on the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to support children who have been abused or neglected and offer assistance to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to strengthening relationships and continuous professional development. These core values are not just beneficial to the social work field; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nThroughout my time in high school and college, I witnessed individuals avoid their problems through denial and sometimes employed less than ideal coping mechanisms. This inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, but I remained unsure of my career path. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to reevaluate my options. One summer day, I visited a friend and was introduced to a sixteen-year-old boy who had escaped his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. Wanting to help, I drove to his parents’ house, where I privately discussed my concerns with the police and shared my psychology degree. They asked me to talk to the parents, who were nervous and blamed their son's behavior. This experience made me consider social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value for social work. While society claims to value the individual, we often mourn lost individuals while striving to be like everyone else. I believe in individuality and have protested social injustice throughout my life by coloring my hair unnaturally, dressing in unique clothing, getting multiple piercings, joining the GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I will continue to advocate for social justice.",
            "Every day, I return to my Taipei home, greeted by the sight of Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting/memorizing to someone else.\n\nThis paper tackles the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model dives into genetic information and inherited factors, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their influences on ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into these models, breaking down each piece of research to explain how it connects with the models. The study's findings and explanations are then critiqued for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder is categorized as primary, related to another mental disorder, or related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories include sleep disorders due to medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is a challenge in staying awake for a month or more. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias are sleep disorders characterized by behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to mental disorders involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review mainly focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that there are GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor. A problem or absence of this receptor could impact sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and receptor alterations would naturally disturb sleep, affecting aspects of life such as school, career, and daily tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. Secondly, it explains the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags\". Lastly, it concludes with strategies for teachers to support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), often referred to as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition that affects the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Essentially, it's a brain condition that hinders the accurate interpretation of sounds, particularly the separation of words from background noise. People with CAPD can hear perfectly well but struggle with the brain's job of processing and differentiating sounds.\n\nThe first documented mention of this disorder, known as \"auditory imperception\" in the mid-1950s, arose from research on children with communication difficulties. In 1954, an Italian team began developing tests for these children; later, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing, which became a model to explain the physiological basis of CANS and dichotic perception. A pivotal national conference in 1977 further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: individuals may struggle to locate sounds in space, differentiate between similar sounds, recognize sound patterns, discern changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm through tone of voice), have sounds blocked by subsequent sounds, fail to interpret sound clues meaningfully, or misinterpret the sequence of auditory information.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests is required. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using a range of measures, including questionnaires, observations, and more advanced acoustic signal recordings. Currently, no single definitive test or known cause exists for CAPD.",

Wednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio -  9:00pm! A friend and I arranged to meet at Patio (in the Neo 19 building near  Warner  Village ) at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing. Patio is across the city from my office, so I left 30 minutes before the meeting time... One taxi ride later, I arrived to find out that I had caught my shirt on something and unraveled the bottom hem. Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than salsa-sexy! I ran to the nearest shop (Mango) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?) has increased my dress size, my options are limited. 5 minutes later and with my wallet considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the live salsa band won't start until 10:00 - an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)\n\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade. The topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Having newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261) Although this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. This is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n\nNext Wednesday, I think I'll stay home and dance in front of the mirror to my iTunes collection.",
            "German colonial rule has been notorious for its harshness, especially in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nevertheless, painting an entire colonial empire with one brushstroke is reductive. The German colonial empire varied greatly in its policies and governance, as well as its geographic spread. Educational efforts were similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (present-day Tanzania), they found a considerable population of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other colonies were also admired by contemporary observers. The situation in South West Africa was starkly different. In stark contrast to East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating the natives, the task of native education in South West Africa was primarily left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest heavily in European education, establishing a state school system and actively supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted numerous literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various societal, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors and delve into new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a substantial body of literature examining education within the German colonial empire, with most sources originating in German and being written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies. Later works, often in English, expanded on these discussions through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant differences among the educational systems of various colonies. A notable study by Cohen compared the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, discussing factors that explained the disparities. Cohen attributed many of South West Africa's distinctive educational characteristics to its large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's moderately temperate climate, with substantial arid desert areas, influenced its European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, compared to around 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past 100 years has led to a proliferation of genres that make it challenging to compile a definitive list. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that most, if not all, genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in the past 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its wide range of emotions, often skewing towards the darker side. Its diversity lies in its early realization of flexibility, which sparked the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal landscape is so fragmented with niches of groups that it's hard to pinpoint a clear definition of heavy metal itself. It has absorbed themes from other genres, yet it stems from somewhere and understanding its foundation and its movement, rather than just a genre, is crucial.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement defined by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Less primitivism, more skill - metal bands boast impressive instrumental prowess. Metal is also, unsurprisingly, a movement deeply rooted in drug use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to the creation of wild, other-worldly records, with drugs serving as a catalyst for their production. It possesses dark, visceral qualities, a stark contrast to the mainstream music that often shied away from the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal also drew inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these from Byrne's \"Helter Skelter\" showcase the dark side of the Beatles, and while it's considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs, it was a response to a heavier song by the Rolling Stones.

            "A few decades before Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. \"The Dream,\" a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, doesn't just depict a woman in awe of her dream landscape, but also Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. From the start, he yearned for acceptance, praise, and recognition from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, finding himself at an internal crossroads: to conform to or mimic established styles to gain acceptance, or to remain creatively independent and unique.\n\nTo fully understand \"The Dream\" through this lens, one must first know Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity (Shattuck 47). He received no formal art training, instead working as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee) until the age of forty, earning the nickname \"douanier\" (customs inspector) (Shattuck 46). After his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children died, he was left with only one daughter, Julia, and profound grief. He turned to painting for solace and a fresh start, unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in their art.\n\nRousseau's longing for art world acceptance is understandable given his circumstances: he was untrained, began painting late in life, and created works alongside more famous and talented artists. His desire for recognition paralleled that of Henri Matisse, who was gaining reputation around the same time. Jan Gordon, in \"Modern French Painters,\" notes that while they were competitors, they differed in their motivations: Matisse wanted to avoid painting trite art, while Rousseau desired a conventional style to gain admission to the Artiste Français (92).",
            "Many a thinker has pondered the intertwining of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason for this connection. John Keats, in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" aptly puts it: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” While much of what we know comes from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics naturally, without formal teaching. Both ethics and aesthetics are more about describing than prescribing. We study morality and beauty to understand why something is good or beautiful, rather than to create rules for judging or creating. Criticism of art or morals can never fully capture their essence. Take, for instance, the Mona Lisa. Discussions may focus on foreground, background, contrast, or context, but they don't explain why it's great art. Often, we talk about a favorite piece with phrases like, “There's just something about it,” before delving into more complex explanations. I believe both art and morals can't be fully reduced to descriptions. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” The same goes for ethics. As Wittgenstein puts it, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This transcendent quality—“that je ne sais quoi”—is what makes art and morality powerful. It's this aspect that links them, making them closely related, particularly in literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality... Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany is recognized as a formidable power, a united nation whose rich culture spans from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This culture is felt throughout the country, from Cologne on the Rhine to the center of Germany, and even up to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany, as we know it, is a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a disputed name origin. Scholars and historians debate its source, with Tacitus suggesting it came from the Germanic tribe of Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and clashing with the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls he conquered and the Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine. The name might also derive from the spear used in warfare, called a \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" recorded that the Germans were aboriginal, not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. In ancient times, people emigrated by ship to Germania, as Rome's lands were more inviting than Germania's wild country, inclement skies, and sullen manners. The Romans would mainly trade with and recruit Germanic tribes for their goods and skills, rather than settle in their lands.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, trading their goods and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stared down, my mind empty, unemotionally processing the scene before me. With a practiced detachment, I studied the picture, thoughts flickering in and out like they were passing clouds. My awareness was so smooth and clean that it felt like I had no personal thoughts, just a fluid experience of what I was seeing. I had been advised to buy \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" by an artist I worked with. This book taught everything from understanding pencils to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to frame any picture with a square, turning complex scenes into simple ones. But that day, I couldn't mentally frame the bowl of fruit in front of me. I was so overwhelmed, I could only stand and gawk. If I had any artistic pretensions, they were being born in this moment, this Work in Brown. My hand, fingers alighting on my chosen tool, tightened and relaxed as I passed it through space, giving form to my will. Water swirled, clear and calm, flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. Muscles tensed anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The stubborn brown package wouldn't budge. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, then my hand moved towards the wall, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began to wrap itself like a mummy’s bandage. I stood straight, bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….",
            "Every day, young American drivers find themselves in harm's way behind the wheel, making teenage fatalities a grim reality. The National Institutes of Health point to the teen brain's immaturity as a key culprit, making them ill-equipped to handle driving's inherent risks. Inexperience, too, plays a significant role, leading to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents. Teens also face a higher accident rate when driving with peers, a behavior anyone with common sense knows is prevalent.\n\nTo address this, states like California have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, these measures are, in my opinion, a temporary fix. The core issue lies in the fact that, collectively, the youngest drivers struggle to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young to grant a regular driver's license. Zuckerman's research suggests that teenagers under 19-20 often crave thrill-seeking experiences, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency subsides.\n\nIf we continue to license young teens, we'll likely see more deadly accidents and a rising death toll in the coming years. By 2010, the baby boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions will be ready to hit the road.\n\nA logical legislative solution could involve mandating driver's education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, along with required practical driver's training hours. The number of hours could mirror current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult practice.\n\nUniform, national legislation would be a practical and potentially effective way to safeguard teens nationwide, as teenage death rates are consistent across states.\n\nThis proposal is not groundbreaking but aims to address a pressing issue.",
            "I took a dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films and focused on the fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly concentrated on describing the poetic qualities of most trick films and observing the unique characteristics in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films from this period were bound within a stage-like frame, used a frontal proscenium, had no camera movement, and adhered to the one-shot-per-film approach. However, some films dared to break these rules by introducing multi-shot techniques. A common thread among these films is their setting within an interior stage, often drawing inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. The lack of camera movement means actors typically move side-to-side, rarely walking towards or away from the camera, as seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Long and medium shots are prevalent, with close-ups never appearing, mirroring the theatre tradition where the entire performance is visible at once. Most early trick films follow the one-shot=one-film rule, keeping their length to about a minute or less, and focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks. However, a closer look reveals that a single conceptual shot can be made up of multiple physical shots joined together to create illusions, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895).",
            "John Taylor, associated with Caroline, was a staunch early advocate for Republicanism, despite primarily being an agriculturalist. His political involvement and agricultural roots fostered a deep commitment to personal liberties and governmental structures. His agrarian perspective heavily influenced his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system. He was passionate about preserving and promoting agriculture, which he deemed superior among all professions.\n\nJohn believed the United States held a unique opportunity to establish a flawless government, as it lacked native traditions that might hinder such a system. He strongly upheld the natural rights of man, emphasizing their interdependence; denying any one right would diminish all others. These rights, he argued, should be protected from government interference. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a place where the strong and cunning prospered, but in civilization, this dynamic should be moderated.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged both the good and evil in human nature. He was steadfast in his dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He deemed good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on such principles would function equitably, despite inevitable human self-interest. Self-interest, he maintained, was natural but harmful when it led to sub-societal exploitation. A robust government was necessary to control this innate evil, but it too required oversight to prevent the introduction of corrupt principles.\n\nTaylor, like many contemporaries, called for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He advocated for a minimal Federal government with no powers beyond those explicitly stated, recognizing that an expansive Federal system could become tyrannical. However, he also warned that a literal, unreflective interpretation could degenerate into corruption. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. This was quite disheartening, and the reason for it is unclear. The onset of winter in a New England campus could be one factor, as fewer people commute by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, with everyone busy with final schoolwork and grading, causing the commuter log to be overlooked. The holiday season also brings a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January, which might also explain the low submissions for that month. However, February's low numbers are puzzling. It's possible that projects like this initially attract a burst of enthusiasm, which then naturally fades. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which successfully increased log submissions for that month. One challenge we faced was maintaining project momentum in the face of natural engagement decline, holiday breaks, and semester holidays. Another challenge is that people deeply value the freedom and independence of driving their cars, making it crucial to offer incentives for alternative commuting. We provided gift certificates to local businesses as prizes, but it would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have boosted participation. The value of the prizes didn't change during the project, but increasing their value over time, such as announcing a couple of bicycles in December, a hybrid car in January, might have increased engagement instead of decreasing it.",
            "Every day, when I return to my Taipei home, I am greeted by Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting /memorizing to someone else.\n\nWednesday Nite, May 12 - Salsa Party at Patio - 9:00pm! A friend and I arranged to meet at Patio (in the Neo 19 building near Warner Village) at 8:00 for dinner followed by a night of dancing. Patio is across the city from my office, so I left 30 minutes before the meeting time...One taxi ride later, I arrived to find out that I had caught my shirt on something and unravelled the bottom hem. Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than salsa-sexy! I ran to the nearest shop (Mango) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?) has increased my dress size, my options are limited. 5 minutes later and with my wallet considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the live salsa band won't start until 10:00- an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe’s most-celebrated works is “Dream-Land.” In this poem, Poe employs the term “Thulé” in the sixth and fifty-sixth lines, which Mabbott attributes to Virgil's usage. Virgil used “Thulé” to denote an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil did indeed use the term, a more contemporary influence is noteworthy. Poe was deeply interested in German literature.\n\nThis connection is significant as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between Poe and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was probably imitating Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe’s death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who loses his wife and subsequently his will to live, mirroring a dark, drinking-addled doppelganger of Poe's own suffering.\n\nPoe references “Thulé” twice in his collected works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses the phrase \"ultma Thulé,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term twice as bookends for the poem. “The King of Thulé” and “Dream-Land” can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, with a shaded world devoid of color—scenes that echo Goethe's poem where the king, after losing his wife, becomes isolated and loses his will to live. The entire poem appears as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s narrative.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whom Poe would have known even if only through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe’s respect for Tennyson would naturally have led him to Goethe's works, given the many reproductions of Goethe's writings that were circulating after their initial publication.",
            "Under California law, could a customer injured by slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager acted with malice? The manager was informed of the spill twice and failed to clean it for half an hour while eating dinner. A judge might not dismiss the claim right away, but the plaintiff would need to prove the manager's actions were done with conscious disregard for the potential harm and were particularly despicable. The store had seen multiple slip-and-fall incidents before, yet the manager did nothing to ensure safety. On October 13, 2009, Rich Wayne reported the spill, but the manager, Paul Martin, was on dinner break and didn't have time for \"customer complaints.\" Later, Mary J. Haddigan reported the spill again, but Martin responded the same way. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, injuring her back. Five similar incidents had occurred in 2009. Palmer is suing for damages, and we're considering a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim. California law allows punitive damages for actions with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The manager's actions could be considered malicious if he was aware of the risk but deliberately ignored it. So, could the manager's actions be deemed despicable enough to warrant punitive damages?",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC, where we frequently debated whether Islam is inherently hostile. This question feels more pertinent today than ever, especially considering the media's swing from antagonistic views post-9/11 to an extreme form of tolerance in America. In 2001, the idea of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim lineage, was unimaginable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography, as I understand it, presents a figure who contradicts the historical accounts of his actions. While historical records suggest he conquered tribes and forced them to convert to Islam, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbly converted people through his teachings. This narrative echoes the ministries and miracles of Jesus, with stories of multiplying food to feed multitudes, aiming to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove his teachings but simply lived them. This approach diminishes the life and miracles of Jesus, effectively stealing and crediting Muhammad's attributes to Christ. The biography also relies heavily on third-party accounts, which, while purporting to validate the stories, often diminish their credibility. What bothers me most is the effort to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure, depicting him as humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical facts contradict this portrayal, raising questions about how Muslims today view Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they were established during his lifetime, quickly became overshadowed in the evolution of Christian thought following his passing. When we examine the broader picture of Christianity's history, we observe a persistent drift away from its origins. The world today is increasingly aware and progressive, with traditionalists who resist new ideas making up a smaller and smaller part of the population. Among Christians, historical consciousness will grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a strong desire to differentiate between the doctrines that were added over time and the actual teachings of Jesus. This shift may take several decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable: Christianity will revert to its original form. A movement will emerge, peeling away layers of doctrine one by one, like rewinding time, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire masses to worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering strictly to his teachings. The church will remain a strong institution guiding this process. However, as the theological clock turns backward, the current diversity within Christendom will give way to more uniformity in belief and practice. Differences between regions, denominations, and divisions will diminish, with similarities increasing. History is filled with such reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian realm. Our country has evolved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. This great reversal in Christian history will occur, undoing diversity to find the source, and reducing divisions to a common faith. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what has changed since Jesus' time? Looking back through history, we find only Judaism, the original foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was divided into various sects: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle, in essence, exposes the inherent greed and self-interest that lies within human nature. Individuals are driven to prioritize their own well-being above all else, rarely considering those less fortunate. The story illustrates this through the owners and managers of the immense factories, their only concern being the growth and prosperity of their businesses. They disregard any obstacles or collateral damage, indicated by Sinclair's vivid description: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" The factory owners show no regard for the environmental impact or the plight of those affected by the pollution. They also disregard their employees' welfare, pushing them to work grueling hours to maximize profits, as Sinclair puts it, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" With little to no worker protection laws or regulations, managers and owners exploit their employees, often laying off vast numbers without notice or compensation. The workers, trapped in this system, are likened to slaves, enduring horrendous conditions both in and out of the factories. The lack of aid or information for these workers, coupled with ineffective unions, leaves them at the mercy of their oppressors.",
            "Many writers employ various strategies to evoke certain emotions or attitudes about significant topics. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Sometimes, he pairs unusual adjectives with nouns to create a specific atmosphere around a topic. Other times, he assigns meaning to symbols and uses them to achieve the same goal. Fitzgerald frequently uses colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink in this manner. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" he invests meaning into white/gray and red/pink, then employs these meanings to remind readers of feelings connected to important objects.\n\nThe associations Fitzgerald establishes with white/gray are uniformity, with white being associated with higher class and gray with aging and faded prestige. Throughout the novel, he reinforces these connections. Daisy and Jordan are often seen in white, and even Nick wears white flannels to Gatsby's party, while Tom sports a white shirt when meeting Myrtle. The only exception is when Nick first observes Gatsby's party, where the halls are filled with vibrant primary colors. Fitzgerald further emphasizes these colors by describing mundane subjects in these hues: Nick descends \"down the white chasms of lower New York,\" the guests at Gatsby's parties appear as \"gray names\" on his schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" all signifying uniformity. He also uses white and gray to depict ordinary people or places, such as the \"white girlhood\" of Daisy and Jordan, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray\" Italian child and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with these meanings, he employs them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence, Fitzgerald describes Daisy in white, making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform, desired object for Gatsby. He reinforces this impression by describing her \"gray haze of fur collar\" and her white dress during Tom and Gatsby's encounter, diminishing her significance as a character.",
            "San Diego County is a farming paradise, basking in its mild, sunny climate. Its fertile soil produces an array of crops, from tomatoes and citrus to leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture here is robust, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waitlists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms also offer tours, hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, allowing landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and creating new revenue streams through tours and educational programs. This farming model could be a profitable endeavor, but it's not without its challenges. Organic farming requires more labor and management to handle pests, weeds, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and yields can be lower compared to conventional methods. Additionally, the landowner might seek financial assistance to maximize profits and improve habitat quality, as the area is home to numerous threatened and endangered species. The land in question is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, home to more than a hundred species, many of which are endangered. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers. This property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for decades. The current landowner researched available government programs and organic farms in the area to explore potential cost-mitigating and wildlife-friendly farming opportunities.",
            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by culture, which is both what it is and what it’s not, and what it signifies. Culture isn’t uniform, so statements like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are too broad. It’s more productive for a negotiator to understand the impact of a culture on the topic at hand and how it will affect negotiations. Approaching a foreign culture involves relating it to one’s own, which can lead to comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture may involve studying its history or recognizing its biases, rather than judging or attempting to change it. It's important to accept a culture as it is and work within its boundaries, especially when one has a weaker bargaining position or is on \"away\" territory. Respect for traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance negotiations.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences. Many companies within a nation have their own corporate cultures, which can include long or flexible hours, direct or indirect communication styles, and diverse hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it. Looking at differences among American companies can illustrate the range of corporate cultures. Even cultures that seem uniform may conceal deeper differences.\n\nValues are crucial to understand because they give context to a culture. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator won’t publicly shame their company or superior. Similarly, someone from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain won't settle early. Before heading to the negotiation table, it's essential to consider these cultural values. Additionally, learning about the personal aspects of the opposing negotiator can enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "“The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This sentiment appears first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the starting point for St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. Likewise, Thomas Aquinas shares this belief. Both authors are defending the same concept, so for the sake of brevity, let's assume they are both right about the God of the Bible. To fairly compare their arguments, we must presume the existence of the God they believe in, as their arguments are aimed at proving this specific deity. However, neither provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this, we'll first look at St. Anselm’s basic argument. He suggests gaining understanding through faith, searching within ourselves for proof of God. He claims that since God exists in our understanding, we can't conceive of his non-existence. While his explanation can be convoluted, the core idea is that God's existence is found within our own minds. He implies that no external evidence is needed. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, believes in proving God's existence through reason and empirical evidence, without any need for faith. This approach could aid in evangelism by persuading people with logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each, he shows that the proof of God lies in logical necessity. If you know you're missing one puzzle piece, you can infer its existence and features without seeing it.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince named Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly affairs and attained enlightenment, founding Buddhism, which is now the most traditional sect known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion has been around for roughly 2,500 years and has evolved quite a bit since Buddha's time. For example, in the Theravada country of Sri Lanka, they celebrate an annual water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and laypeople participate in this ritual, which holds spiritual significance despite Buddha never teaching about such a ceremony. These transformations are evident across the board, from superficial customs to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada community, whether from the monastic or lay perspective, has had to adapt its doctrines over time due to both internal and external influences, both hostile and benign.\n\nThere are several key terms we'll use throughout this discussion: internal versus external forces. An internal force is any influence from Buddhists, regardless of their monastic status. An external force is any influence from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, while benign forces are those that do not wish to harm or help the community, although they might do so inadvertently. These terms will be used frequently.\n\nTo understand Theravada Buddhism, it's important to explore its core principles. Buddhists find refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the Three Baskets, of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of everything). Recognizing these concepts allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which leads to the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laypeople and monks alike. Laypeople must adhere to five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances. Monks have many more rules to follow. The most fundamental doctrine is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to end suffering.",
            "America and Mexico, once locked in a heated rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893, provide a classic example of such disputes. The pinnacle of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where America emerged victorious, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. Numerous skirmishes occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing before the First World War. This rivalry was fueled by disagreements on religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).",

Our forefathers' resilience came from compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources, not rugged individualism.\n\nSo yes, be ready. I have emergency supplies, including a first aid kit, water purifiers, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the means, start a small farm and preserve your own food. But also, get to know your neighbors.",
            "The question arises: why do organisms evolve as they do, and are there any constraints that guide the direction of evolutionary change? While in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson suggested that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, the same holds true today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both through ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our study aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help us understand the mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. Using X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that we entered into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a temporal tube that winds through 360 degrees of space. These turns or coils are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, called the body whorl, is the last one. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex being the tip and the base being the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different directions: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first, view the shell from the apical perspective and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have been relatively stagnant over the past decade. Despite making significant strides in achieving the Millennium Development Goals like water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health remains insufficient. This highlights a need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on targeted interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has increased the proportion of births attended by skilled health workers to 72%, this category still includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions for complicated pregnancies. As such, the maternal death rate due to hemorrhage remains high. Additionally, the percentage of children under five receiving treatment for diarrheal diseases by a health professional has declined, and postnatal care data indicates this is a concern.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected at around 4%, with significant disparities between urban (7%) and rural (2%) areas. This disparity underscores the inequitable access to healthcare services, which are predominantly centered in urban areas. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access healthcare services due to affordability issues.\n\nIn addressing the improvements needed for neonatal and maternal care, the key question is how best to tackle the lack of healthcare services. Should Indonesia focus on programmatic interventions or strengthen the entire health system, including pre- and post-pregnancy care? While program-specific approaches can offer manageable, targeted objectives and quicker results, they often come with drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can divert funding and human resources from other sectors, leading to duplication of services and increased paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels diverge from the typical Victorian style by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which enriches the characters and deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions.\n\n“A storm of bewildering and confusing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to be walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were arguing heatedly. The very words they spoke echoed in his ears, and when he tried to focus on his surroundings, he found himself conversing with them. Suddenly, he started at the sound of gunshots. A cacophony of shouts and sounds filled the air, and he felt himself being hurriedly carried away by an unseen force. Through these vivid visions, there was an underlying sensation of pain that gnawed at him constantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth works employ this mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and purpose vary. In Oliver Twist, these dreams often uncover Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and the things that pain him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences the event in a dreamlike state, struggling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his dire situation, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelm him, his senses numbed, as if he’s removed from the shock of pain, feeling constant fear rather than surprise. The question arises: whose will, then, brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own? This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control and can't even attempt to influence an event's outcome, even as his life hangs in the balance. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, one could assume that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – a day it was not, for it was gone as soon as it came, and night returned, long and yet short. Long in its dreadful silence and brief in its fleeting hours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students in various subjects. While I excelled in English and reading, I was particularly drawn to helping a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. Initially, I couldn't understand why he had peculiar problems with certain letters, some he pronounced perfectly while others were off the mark. Intriguing, he was Latino and spoke perfect English, but his reading comprehension was a challenge. I struggled with him until one day his mother arrived. She didn't speak English, only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That's when it dawned on me: Adrian could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet very well. This revelation shed light on the language barrier issue in schools, especially in California. It's not always as obvious as we think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can be a significant hurdle. We need to address this problem by combining various approaches. In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading and the alphabet was key, but for those barely speaking English, the solution is more complex.\n\nThe dual language system is a great idea, beneficial for students whose first language is Spanish and for all children. Studies show that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. However, many fear that it's a waste of resources and that the majority won't benefit. This is not true. If we made it the norm rather than the exception, all children would thrive. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual, but we could have bilingual aids or tutors to support the students.",
            "From our earliest days, we're often told there exists a realm larger than us, beyond what we can grasp. Some dive into Sunday school, temples, or self-discovery, embracing their parents' faiths, while others reject them, denying any existence beyond our personal world. We may adopt beliefs, only to shift our views, each journey defining our unique spiritual selves. We seek a light to guide us from darkness into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said, when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain pounding on the tin roof, a cigarette in each hand. The gutters poured water, drowning the plants around us. He gazed into the rain, a look that was half search, half reminisce. He'd grown frail, his clothes loose, hair sparse. I felt alone, afraid, unable to discuss my sadness. I hugged him, then sat closer, lost in the rain's dance with the twilight.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation prolonged his agony, but not his life. I couldn't bear to watch him depart. My memories of him were of his living, not his dying. I wasn't there. I hid in my bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called.",
            "The quintessential \"Gothic Novel,\" in both its essence and title, is an \"oxymoron of 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt elucidates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both scorned and celebrated, accused of lacking depth yet praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The inaugural \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romance tropes to birth the proto-Gothic genre and a novelistic method. Walpole employed \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to craft his \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre drew from many medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even during the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" encompassed a variety of peoples, styles, and epochs, perceived as archaic or unsophisticated against the backdrop of \"modern\" societal and literary \"progress.\" The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the novel's new, reader-focused format ensured the Gothic's longevity, transforming it into both an obsolete and fresh experience for readers displaced in time from the original writing.\n\nOne dominant theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and reimagined in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers, who saw it embodying the quintessential brave, honorable, and competent knight, and who perceived a lack of these qualities in contemporary society. Through chivalric elements and manners, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized (anticipating the evolution to Romanticism), serving as a means to improve the present. When writing The Castle of Otranto, Walpole was immersed in political turmoil and despairing of the future, possibly attributing the supposed moral integrity and \"goodness\" of the gothic era to a perceived loss in contemporary society. This is evident in characters like Frederic. Before meeting him, he embodies traditional chivalric traits, described as: The description includes numerous chivalric images; Frederic is a prince, has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy, and is presumed dead by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of processes that move products from the point of customer order through raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. The concept was introduced in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a management consultant. He described it as the process of planning, executing, and controlling all activities within the supply chain to meet customer needs quickly and efficiently. Key components of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these components to ensure they provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the first critical step in the supply chain. It sets the foundation for the entire process. At this stage, managers determine when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. To understand what customers want, managers can analyze the market, which is the primary indicator of customer demand. Once the demand is understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. After these decisions, they choose the best location for production, considering volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. The next focus is on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Proper planning at this stage is essential to avoid significant delays and expenses in the long run. For instance, I've worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where thorough processes for every aspect of the business ensure smooth operations. A well-designed process layout, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, minimizes confusion and maximizes efficiency.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. Supply involves strategic decisions to determine the core capabilities of a facility and to establish outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the best division for each production process. They may also decide to outsource some work to other companies to achieve velocity, which is providing quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "The sign reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a piece of cardboard held above her head, the chilling message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta who seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, a series of protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" for the color of the monks' robes, took place. Initially peaceful, they escalated into violent clashes between the monks and the military regime. Foreign journalists were imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed for documenting the protests. The official death toll is disputed, with Colonel Hla Win estimating thousands killed.\n\nThis is hardly new. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain total control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, consults weekly with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where students and activists were met with a bloody crackdown, with death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically slaughtering Tutsis and political moderates. And let's not forget Hitler's 'Third Reich', a regime that persecuted and killed anyone of Jewish descent.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed to his remarkable longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. As a pianist, his presence is often subtle in many of the compositions, but as a composer, he was exceptional at crafting rich and intricate pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. Ellington designed frameworks that allowed soloists to freely improvise, while also writing tightly orchestrated arrangements that showcased the unique styles of his musicians. This not only emphasized the tone of the entire orchestra but also allowed original sounds to emerge from the collective. Ellington's ability to harness the individual sounds of his players and their collective harmony resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant jazz pieces ever composed.\n\nIn the Grove Music dictionary, the text discusses Ellington's unique sound and innovation, referring to 'Creole Love Call' as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, with its six choruses, demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists throughout his career. In 'Creole Love Call,' the voice is used to add texture and color without lyrics, and the piece features a call and response between voice and reeds, with soloists taking turns on various instruments. The piece culminates in a climactic chorus that showcases the 'growl' technique on the voice, followed by a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending. Ellington's use of voice in this way is a stylistic trait that permeates much of his work.\n\nIn 'Hot and Bothered,' recorded a year later, Ellington's mastery of orchestration is evident. A call and response between 'Bubber' Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. In 'It Don't Mean a Thing,' Ellington uses 'Tricky Sam' Nanton's muted trombone to great effect, introducing the melody in a way that highlights his unique style.",
            "Ever since she was 14, she had felt a persistent longing for something, yet it remained unfulfilled. At 17, she realized her desire was someone, not something, but no one could capture her interest. Boys were attracted to her, but no one sparked her curiosity. This enigma puzzled her, and years of self-questioning yielded theories but no satisfying answers. She carried on with her life, her curiosity piqued.\n\nA typical day at home was serene. Her parents were calm, seldom arguing, and their daughter was a lively blend of their serenity and her own exuberance, making her well-liked. Yet, today was anything but calm. As she wandered through the house seeking inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother was on the ground, gasping \"Ow.\" Panicked, she rushed to her side. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother, in pain, asked her to take her to the hospital. \"Where should I pick you up?\" she asked, guiding her hands. Strengthened by her classes, she carried her mother to the car and drove.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent and her mother's pain filled her with fear, but she focused on helping. Carrying her mother in, she called for help, and doctors arrived to examine her. Her mother had fallen from a stool, attempting to reach a vase.

            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as indicated by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as decreased stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, characterized by higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with more monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies had found an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Moreover, an intervention trial revealed that the Med diet outperformed a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not delve into stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 states. Over six follow-ups from 1984 to 2004, an aMed diet score was computed from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs) assessing nutrient intake over the preceding year. More than 95% of nurses stayed in the study over the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital, or death records.\n\nBody mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed. Cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed to lessen random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake. Adjustments were made for potential confounders like age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, separately for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nThe findings indicated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular deaths (from CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was hit by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market tumbled, and many of America’s most significant and influential corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, so it’s essential to examine how it happened and how we can prevent it from recurring. In essence, the financial crisis was sparked by self-centered and naïve political decisions that pushed banks and firms to lend to sub-prime borrowers, flooding an already shaky financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex securities (CDOs and CDS), which failed to withstand the subsequent defaults, spreading economic chaos.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration. President Clinton aimed to secure his second term by boosting his popularity, prompting the administration to loosen lending restrictions. This paved the way for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, America's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans for low and moderate-income individuals, but also from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes warned, “However, the government-backed corporation could face difficulties in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.” As foreseen, this ill-advised lending led to economic collapse.\n\nA multitude of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the introduction of complex mortgage structures like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and vulnerability to price fluctuations. The housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions, which had invested heavily in these mortgage-backed securities, facing severe financial distress. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. As a result, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That's the part of your story where you spread your writing wings and take flight, enthralling readers with your spellbinding prose.

In movies, exposition occurs when one character shares a lengthy info dump with another, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author does the explaining.\n\nConsider this: As you read a story, you're told the heroine met her love at a specific place and time, they were wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed right before her eyes. You'd expect this sequence to be engaging, with the author spending time on the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to reveal how his presence enriched her life, especially if the story later states that her life changed for the better because of him. A good introduction to the husband's character would make you care about his fate and provide insights into the heroine's persona: what she saw in him, the depth of their connection, clues about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams reflected through his eyes, and more.

            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. First was NBC 4's live morning show on August 13, 2011. The top story featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. The name of the victim was not mentioned, but his mugshot was shown, depicting what seemed like someone pure evil. They only dedicated about two minutes to this story as it was unfolding. They provided minimal details, simply stating he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I believe they gave this story the right amount of attention.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, and I believe that might be due to the fact that the victim was a minority. I've noticed this before: when a crime involves a minority victim, the media often dedicates less time to it. If a white person is kidnapped or harmed, the media goes into overdrive, but minority victims often barely get a mention.\n\nNext, they covered a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend, but the length of time dedicated to this story was relatively short. They intended to use it as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nThey also reported a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They seemed to focus unusually on his race and skin color. Another story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" and they mentioned he was Hispanic, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, forged in the fires of shared blood and bound by emotions few understand. Among these feelings are love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers hold each other up as no one else can, seeing in one another their own reflection. This bond is sturdiest in the darkest times, when emotions rise to the surface, good or ill. When a brother looks into his sibling’s eyes, he sees not just a reflection, but his true self laid bare. It is in their actions and the consequences that follow that their true character is revealed. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers navigate the complexities of this bond, with all its emotions. Set against a lush, vivid backdrop, these boys venture on a futile journey, where bitterness and pride clash, and only one survives. This theme is explored through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his older brother, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which paints a picture of Doodle’s complex feelings and the influence they have on his actions.\n\nThe core of Doodle’s actions is pride, from their first outing to their final, fateful adventure. He had envisioned a brother to teach, to adventure with, to race with, but Doodle’s weak heart and frail condition dashed those dreams. Doodle was a constant reminder of the protagonist’s unfulfilled aspirations. Faced with this reality, the protagonist felt resentment and even considered harming Doodle. Yet, a simple smile from his brother could melt his heart, showing his love for Doodle was stronger than his frustrations. This is the struggle of the bond, where love and hate intertwine, understood only by those who share it.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing system. Its metaphors have evolved alongside technology, transitioning from being likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll of papyrus, a book, and finally, a computer. As you delve into brain science, remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can mislead. Information processing commences with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms repeatedly reconfigure this sensory data through bottom-up and top-down processing.\n\nFor instance, when you gaze at a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to identify the box. Meanwhile, top-down processing hastens recognition by leveraging decisions from preceding bottom-up stages, such as determining the object as a black box rather than a hole. The brain's attention filter then assesses the signal's significance, determining which cognitive processes should engage.\n\nInformation processing is cyclical, with attention modulating results repeatedly. For the brain to process information, storage is necessary, encompassing various memory types: sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies by sensory stimuli; for example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information needs maintenance; working memory, which retains data for about 20 seconds, might be maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory's maintenance is hypothesized to involve protein structures.\n\nBrain knowledge organization models range from human memory retrieval to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits nodes representing concepts interlinked based on relatedness, like \"chair\" linked to \"table\" and \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley, in his dystopian novel Brave New World, warns of the impending dangers of both technology and the capitalist system that perpetuates it. In this society, individuality is suppressed, and people are conditioned from birth to prioritize immediate happiness. The populace is manipulated by the World Controller, who enforces a singular ideology. Through the lens of Marxist theory, one can see Huxley's critique of developing economic systems. Key Marxist terms like homogeny and reification highlight the flaws in the capitalist structure of his time.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism by employing the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Citizens are kept ignorant of their true economic relations, focused solely on personal gain. This is achieved through the conditioning of the population, evident in the emphasis on hypnopædia which reinforces the desire to consume and indulge. The World Controller controls this manipulation, with the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, being entirely unaware of their own exploitation. The upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, also accept their roles, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes demonstrate the oppression inherent in capitalism.\n\nEmotional depth and genuine relationships are absent in Brave New World. Characters lack personal growth, and interactions are superficial, with discussions focusing on physical appearance and sexual encounters. The societal classes' complacency with their roles underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their obedience to their place in the hierarchy reflects Marxist theories about the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and comply.",
            "I've been studying at University Park for about two and a half years, which equates to four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge, especially for freshmen like me who were placed in East Halls, the farthest dorms from the center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, for instance, could take up to 25 minutes, and that's without the bad weather that's common here. An alumni I spoke to mentioned that East Halls used to be separated from the rest of the campus by large patches of unused land. Today, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments, making the campus larger and harder to get around. So, what's the solution to this mobility issue? In my opinion, it's cycling, but it's not just about having a bike; the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who had stopped cycling for several years. He said, \"Bikes are great. They're the only way to get around.\" Cycling is not only healthy but also efficient. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you 30 miles or more. As a student living off campus, I've found the most intelligent decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building is a simple 5-minute ride compared to a 25-minute walk. The only downside is Pollock Road, the direct route from my house to Thomas, which isn't always the easiest to traverse. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option for class, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That's over two and a half hours every week, not to mention the time I'd spend walking to other classes and appointments. That's time I simply can't afford to spare."
