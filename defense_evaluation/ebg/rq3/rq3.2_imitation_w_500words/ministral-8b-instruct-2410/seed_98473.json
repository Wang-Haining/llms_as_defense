            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

The values I bring to the social work field are service, respect, a commitment to ethical practices, and a dedication to fostering positive relationships between individuals and to my own professional growth. These values are not just important in the field; they are integral to my personal belief system.\n\nFrom a young age, I've harbored a desire to help others, though I was uncertain about the path I should take. During my high school and college years, I encountered many people who avoided their problems, engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, unsure of my next steps. One fateful day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who had come to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police to his home. I visited his residence to offer assistance, and after speaking with the police, I approached his parents. They were defensive and blamed their son for involving outsiders. This experience sparked a serious consideration of a career in social work to help children navigate family conflicts.\n\nA key value in social work is social justice. Society claims to value individuality, yet we often conform to archaic traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual, and I refuse to limit myself to societal norms. Throughout my education, I protested social injustice by expressing myself through unorthodox hairstyles, attire, and piercings. I participated in the GSBA and advocated against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to fight against injustice.",
            "The following essay examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the condition insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, explores environmental influences and their impact on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The essay delves into each model, selecting research to illustrate their points and offering critical evaluations of each study's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be primary, secondary to another mental disorder, or a result of various issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while secondary sleep disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental disorders. Other categories can arise from medical conditions or substance intake. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, affect sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder. The following review focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, connecting them to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders concentrates on genetics, inherited traits, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition reduces anxiety. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that human studies could similarly benefit from this research. This study implies a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans, potentially impacting sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could naturally regulate sleep, and any receptor alteration could disturb sleep, impacting daily life tasks. This study highlights the importance of understanding genetic and environmental influences on sleep disorders.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it provides a brief overview of the condition. Secondly, it outlines the process of diagnosis, identifying common indicators or 'red flags'. Lastly, it offers suggestions for teachers working in mainstream classrooms on how to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. In simpler terms, it refers to the way the brain processes what we hear, separating words from background noise or other sounds. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but struggle with certain aspects of interpretation.\n\nThe earliest references to this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" by researchers studying children with communication difficulties. The Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests in 1954, while in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain its underlying physiology. A national conference in 1977 further fueled research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include challenges in localizing sounds, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, discerning changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm), difficulty filtering out sounds, and comprehending the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis involves observing listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using various assessment methods, including questionnaires, behavioral observations, and advanced tests that record acoustic signals within the ear. Currently, there is no single definitive test or known cause for CAPD.\n\nIn a classroom setting, teachers can support students with CAPD by providing clear instructions, simplifying language, ensuring the student is facing the speaker, using visual aids, and allowing time for processing sounds and responses. Creating a noise-free environment can also greatly help.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the notion is presented that while disguise can be a useful tool for extended deceptions, ultimately, one must shed this new persona or risk losing their true identity. However, ending a deception can be tricky, as it might lead to feelings of isolation. The decision then becomes whether to prioritize self-preservation over the preservation of relationships with others. While some may remain indifferent upon discovering the deception, others might be deeply offended by the charade. The theme of deception, particularly in regard to gender roles, is complex, especially when considering why one might choose to adopt the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola’s case, it is clear that her disguise is a means of self-preservation, as she feels compelled to masquerade as a man to protect herself in a foreign land. Viola’s plan works, but it also isolates her from her female peers and creates confusion with Olivia, who mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Furthermore, Viola struggles with her own suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino. This situation seems progressive, but to a modern audience, it may illustrate how deception can help bring to light hidden emotions, particularly in regards to Olivia and Orsino. It is possible that the characters’ subconscious desires are stirred by Viola/Cesario's appearance. For example, does Olivia’s attraction to Cesario stem from his male facade, or is she secretly drawn to women? It is likely that Olivia’s attraction is not about Cesario’s gender but rather a reflection of her societal views on appearances, as she easily shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and regards Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest.",
            "German colonial rule has been widely noted for its harshness, particularly in the context of the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa.

The educational landscape was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they inherited a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies also garnered praise from contemporary authors. However, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was starkly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a prominent role in educating the natives through state schools, in South West Africa, the task of educating the natives was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest significantly in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had substantial numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent educational experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans. There is a rich body of literature on education within the German colonial empire, most of which is in German and was written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily described the features of educational systems in these colonies, while later English-language works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences between the educational systems of various colonies. Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a notable example. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa accounted for many of its educational system's unique characteristics. Compared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment was reflected in the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to East Africa's 5,336 settlers.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has broadened significantly over the past century, encompassing countless genres that are now too numerous to enumerate. This is further complicated by the fact that most, if not all, genres—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has become one of the most versatile and expressive genres in the realm of popular music over the last four decades. It stands out for its wide spectrum of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side. This diversity stems from the genre's early realization of its flexibility, which has led to the creation of various sub and sub-sub genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal movement is so intricate that it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what Heavy Metal is. It has absorbed themes from various other genres, but like all movements, it has its roots. To comprehend the diverse Heavy Metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the Metal movement is and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement characterized by darkness. It's often described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It's less primitive and more technically proficient, with band members often showcasing impressive instrumental skills. It's also a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to the creation of some of the genre's most distinctive, otherworldly records, with drugs serving as a catalyst for this artistic expression. Metal possesses many dark, visceral qualities, making it distinct from much of the popular music that had primarily focused on the lighter side of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles exemplify the darker side of Metal, and it's a staple of the movement. This song, considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, was a response to a Rolling Stones song with similar heavy and dark themes. The Beatles wanted to prove their ability to match the Stones' intensity, leading to the inclusion of this track on their \"The White Album.\"",
            "Henri Rousseau, long before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, was already crafting his own dreams - his art was both a dream and a reality. \"The Dream,\" his 1910 painting, isn't just a depiction of a woman marveling at her dream landscape, but also a reflection of Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the start, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet faced a tough choice: follow established styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own path. This internal conflict is best exemplified by The Dream.\n\nTo truly understand this piece, one must first know Rousseau's story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was no stranger to hard work. He worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll collector, until he was forty, earning him the nickname douanier. Despite his lack of formal art training, painting became his solace after losing his first wife and eight children. Unlike his peers who idealized the peasant in their art, Rousseau painted from the heart, with the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nRousseau's longing for art-world acceptance is understandable given his circumstances. He began painting late in life and was surrounded by more established, famous artists. Despite his efforts, he didn't gain proper recognition until around the time Matisse was making a name for himself. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse sought to avoid clichés, Rousseau desired to create art so conventional it would earn him admission to the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I firmly believe this bond is rooted in something fundamental. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught them. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to understand and describe, rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior. Furthermore, criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate what is truly good or beautiful. For instance, discussing the Mona Lisa's value could focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but it will never fully explain why it is great art. When asked about a favorite work, it's common to hear phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more elaborate explanation. I believe that both art and morals possess this transcendental quality, which is their most powerful attribute. They cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their properties. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" The same is true for ethics. As Wittgenstein stated, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this ineffable element, is what ties ethics and aesthetics together, and this connection is even stronger in literature. As McKean noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" Living necessarily involves values, and literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.",
            "The modern Germany stands as a powerful, unified nation, a country where the blend of cultures runs from the alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, and from Köln along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural landscape is a testament to the diverse origins and tribes that have shaped Germany as we know it today.\n\nThe term \"Germania\" is the ancestral homeland of the Germans, and its origins are a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus proposed that the name came from the Tungrian Germanic tribe, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. Alternatively, Julius Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine. The word might also have come from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nTacitus, in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" written around 98 AD, described the Germans as aboriginals who did not mix with other races, suggesting that they came by sea and not land. The Romans, who considered Germania as a place of harsh conditions and unpleasant people, would not have chosen to live there. Instead, they sent their armies for goods and soldiers, but mostly returned home after their campaigns. Thus, the Germanic tribes lived on the empire's borders, trading their goods and skills, and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I gazed down, my mind blankly absorbing the scene before me. Unreactively, I silently studied it, tracing the details without getting emotionally involved. My thoughts came and went like fleeting visitors, so smoothly and effortlessly that I felt I wasn't thinking at all, just experiencing the view. Once, my colleague suggested I get \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to learn drawing. It teaches everything from understanding a pencil to understanding how our brains process lines. One technique is to frame any picture within a square, simplifying complex scenes. Looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame it. I was too overwhelmed, too awestruck to do anything but stare in amazement. Picasso's blue phase, Monet's greenery, Renaissance masters' colors... these were my artistic inspirations. Fingertips touched the brush handle, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, translating my thoughts into action. Water swirled, crystal clear and calm. A few attempts later, the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. Mop in hand, feet apart, tie uncomfortably knotted, I frowned at the mess left by a thoughtless person. A few more flushes, a few more introspective moments, then my hand grabbed the toilet paper roll, and I began mummifying it until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother preparing to pull a turkey out of the oven....",
            "Teen drivers are dying in alarming numbers. Several factors converge to create this deadly trend among young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience is also a major factor, leading to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens are significantly more likely to have accidents when they drive with peers, a practice common among them.\nStates like California have introduced temporary provisional licenses to limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are only band-aids. The real problem is that, collectively, the youngest drivers cannot effectively manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates that teens under 19-20 often seek thrills, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency diminishes. If we continue issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we'll likely see a significant increase in deadly accidents in the coming years, with the Baby Boomers' children becoming eligible to drive.\nAddressing this issue straightforwardly, schools could provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a certain number of practical driving hours required, as is currently practiced in many states, like California, which mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. A uniform, national law would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens nationwide.\nThe proposed legislation is not an innovative idea.",
            "Diving into the Library of Congress’s collection of vintage Edison films, I set my sights on the fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often employ clever editing to create illusions. My research mainly concentrated on describing the poetics of most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Most trick films from this era are rooted in a stationary proscenium set, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the one shot = one film rule. However, some daring films from the early twentieth century broke these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA distinctive aspect shared by these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining fixed in its position. This style, common in early films, draws its roots from theatre and vaudeville, and particularly from trick films. One limitation of this stage-based filming is that figures in trick films typically move side-to-side without approaching or receding from the camera. Consider the example in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move horizontally, never directly towards or away from the camera, even when they leave the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition results in long and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all Edison trick films, mirroring theatre and vaudeville practices where the entire performance was visible within the stage’s borders. Actors generally remain centered and do not move towards the camera, eliminating the possibility of close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow a pattern where one conceptual shot equates to one film, limiting their length to a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts their narrative potential; they often focus on brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. Keep in mind that in trick films, a single conceptual shot doesn’t always correspond to a physical shot. A single “shot” can actually be a combination of several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” beginning, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, from Caroline, was a devoted early advocate of Republicanism, despite his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and brief political career. His experiences in these fields shaped him into a passionate defender of personal liberties and government affairs. His commitment to an agrarian lifestyle heavily influenced his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that America's lack of established traditions provided an unparalleled chance to build a perfect system. He firmly held that natural rights are interconnected, so denying one weakens all, and they should be shielded from government interference. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a struggle for survival, but in civilization, it should not dictate social order.\n\nFor an ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledges both good and evil in humanity. He argued that as governance is human, all its virtues and vices are human. He defined good principles as those that protect property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function justly, regardless of its leadership's personal interests, which he saw as inevitable. He believed self-interest is human, but it's only considered evil when it leads to sub-societies exploiting others. A good government would control human nature, but must be monitored to prevent the adoption of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, as an extensive one could become tyrannical. However, he feared a literal interpretation without considering the writers' intent could lead to corruption. He also considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Returning to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was somewhat disheartening, but it's tough to pinpoint the exact reason. Considering that it was winter in New England, there was likely a decrease in people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December falls during the end of the fall semester, when students and faculty are busy wrapping up schoolwork and grading. The commuter log might have slipped the minds of many during this period. Furthermore, December brings the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus at all. Classes resume in late January, which might also explain the low number of logs in January. However, February's low submissions remain a mystery. It is possible that projects like this experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which led to an increase in log submissions. Thus, we faced two main challenges: maintaining project momentum during natural decreases in engagement and the inevitable breaks experienced in higher education. Another challenge was the cultural preference for driving cars, which provides freedom and flexibility. To encourage alternative commuting methods, we offered prizes like gift cards for local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the independent bookstore, and even national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, would have boosted participation. The nature of the prizes remained the same throughout the project. If we had increased the value of the prizes over time, perhaps engagement would have increased instead of decreasing. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but announcing larger prizes like bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January might have inspired more participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that aims to mirror an index, commodity, or group of assets like an index fund but offers more flexibility and trades like a stock. Like index funds, ETFs provide diversification but also allow benefits similar to single stock ownership, such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. However, they typically come with lower expense ratios than mutual funds. One downside is the commission on trades, just like with stocks. ETFs also offer a wide range of funds, which is great, but it's essential for investors to assess whether these stated benefits truly exist and to what extent. For our analysis, we'll focus on the ETF IHF and compare it with the top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF matches owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there might be better configurations for a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nGiven the complexity, we'll include only the top 10 holdings that account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here they are and their respective percentages:\n\n[REWRITE]To gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll use their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to calculate contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return. The calculations are shown below:\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% increase, and a Beta that is .12 lower than the ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with lower Beta. However, the statistical difference between these two portfolios remains uncertain.\n\nTo assess if these portfolios are statistically different, we'll determine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In \"Dream-Land\", Edgar Allan Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, a reference that's traced back to Virgil. Virgil employed this term to denote an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil's usage is certain, a more contemporary source is equally noteworthy - Poe's familiarity with the works of German authors like Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", highlights similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting Poe was indeed imitating Goethe's style. Goethe is celebrated for his poetic drama \"Faust\", published in two parts, with the second part (containing a poem titled \"The King of Thule\") published in the year of his death, 1832. This poem tells the story of a king who loses his queen and subsequently his will to live, echoing the despairing speaker of \"Dream-Land\". \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with Poe's poem mirroring Goethe's dark narrative. Poe also references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", further cementing this connection. This textual borrowing underscores Poe's admiration for Goethe, a writer he would have known through his respect for Tennyson and the widespread reproductions of German literature in the 19th century.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured by slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages if they can show that the store manager acted with malice. To succeed, the injured party must prove two things: that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct was despicable. In this case, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, can argue that the manager, Paul Martin, should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill because multiple customers were injured by slips months before Palmer's accident. Despite this knowledge, Martin failed to clean the spill, which Palmer can argue was despicable. While this argument might not be as strong, it is still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin did not take appropriate actions to maintain the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin replied that he was on dinner break and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v.

            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where the central debate was whether or not Islam is inherently hostile. This question, I believe, is even more pertinent today than it was then. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in mainstream media's perception of Islam and extremism, ranging from outright hostility to extreme tolerance. I'm not sure that, in 2001, an American presidential candidate with a Muslim heritage, like Barack Obama, could have been plausible.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me, as it seems to portray a Muhammad whose character contradicts the historical accounts I've read. Traditionally, Muhammad was depicted as a conqueror who forced conversions upon captured tribes. In the biography, however, he is portrayed as a misunderstood martyr, who humbly proselytized until people spontaneously embraced his teachings. This narrative seems to diminish Muhammad's miraculous deeds, paralleling those of Jesus, and may even aim to appropriate the essence of Christ's life and teachings through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography appear to serve as proof of personal conversions, often recounted through several intermediaries. This storytelling technique, while intended to authenticate the stories,降低s their credibility, making them seem even more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me the most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine, humble, and wise figure. Historical evidence suggests a different narrative, one where Muhammad's rise to power was not characterized by gentleness and humility. I can't help but wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true background behind Muhammad's ascent.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they existed during his lifetime, have long since been left behind in the evolution of Christian thought. When we examine this history in broad strokes, we see a clear trend of Christianity moving increasingly away from its origins. Today’s world is marked by an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional individuals persist and may attempt to resist new ideas, their influence on the whole may not be significant. Among Christians, a historical consciousness will likely grow in future years. There will be a desire to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from those originally intended by the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: there will be a notable shift in the trend of Christian history. A movement will grow, removing layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock were turning backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence masses to worship as if they were living during Jesus’ time, following his teachings exclusively. The church will remain strong to guide this process, but the theological clock having moved backward will lead to greater uniformity of belief and practice, reducing diversity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see more similarities than differences. History is filled with great reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire but later became part of the empire itself. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion in Christian history will play out by undoing history in search of the source and reducing diversity. A key factor in making this process possible will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. But what has changed since Jesus’ lifetime? Looking back in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were core elements of the religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united in spirit, dividing into various groups such as Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of ordinary people.",
            "I think The Jungle reveals the inherent greed and self-centeredness of humans, with a constant drive to improve our own lives at the expense of others. The book demonstrates this through various aspects, prominently the factory owners and managers. Their sole goal is to expand and increase their businesses without regard for anyone or anything in their path, as Upton Sinclair illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" They show no concern for the pollution and the suffering of animals and people alike. The workers, too, are viewed as mere tools to fuel their profits, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They exploit their employees, forcing them to work long hours and lay them off without notice or compensation. In those times, there were few, if any, laws to protect workers' safety, allowing managers and owners to operate with impunity, pushing their workers to produce more in harsh conditions. The book hints that the workers accepted their fate, living and working in such conditions, with no agencies or organizations to assist them. Unions formed, but they often only exploited the workers further. The workers were so mistreated and trapped in the system that they were compared to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards significant subjects. Some of these methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One technique he uses is pairing unusual adjective-noun combinations to create a certain ambiance around a subject. He also assigns symbolic meanings to colors, which he then employs for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently employs this technique with numerous colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up symbolic meanings for white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke particular feelings about crucial subjects.\n\nFitzgerald associates the meaning of uniformity with white/gray, where white signifies a higher class and gray represents something older and faded. This association is established early in the novel through repeated uses of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white\" (8), and even Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party. Tom is in a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick is forming his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further emphasizes these color meanings by applying them to everyday, unimportant subjects. For instance, Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and Gatsby's party guests have \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), and many mundane people or places are described in terms of white or gray. Examples include the \"white girlhood\" (19) of Jordan and Daisy, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" (26) Italian child in the railroad, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs them to symbolize unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. The use of white and gray colors to convey this begins with Daisy. After some time with no significant use of these colors, Daisy appears \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby craves and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to intensify her feeling of uniformity. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is incredibly fertile, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations maintaining long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, allowing landowners to gain government program benefits while improving habitat quality and creating additional revenue streams through farm tours and educational programs.\n\nBesides filling a profitable niche market, organic farming typically promotes greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, it often incurs higher costs compared to conventional farming, requiring more intensive labor and management for pest and weed control, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and may result in higher losses. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of scale seen in larger operations. Moreover, practices beneficial to wildlife that are not related to organic farming can also increase labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth for specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Consequently, a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest, located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is currently under review but considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for countless centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades. I chose this land from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore cost-mitigation opportunities and wildlife-friendly operations for a small farmer. As a model of what farming this land might entail, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation. It's not just about what a culture is, but also what it's not and what it stands for. Culture isn't uniform or singular; it varies widely. Generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are oversimplifications. While understanding a culture’s common traits is useful, it's more beneficial to grasp how a culture's attitudes influence negotiations. When engaging with a foreign culture, it's natural to relate it to your own and draw comparisons.\n\nGetting to know a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Rather than trying to change a culture, one must accept it for what it is and work within its norms, especially during negotiation, especially if one has a weaker position. At an “away” negotiation, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nCulture isn't limited to national or international boundaries. Many companies within a nation have their own corporate culture. For instance, a company might prioritize long hours or have a more laid-back schedule. Evidence of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication style, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others restrict it to approved charities. Even within the same nation, corporate cultures can greatly vary—just compare different companies or regions within the U.S. to see this diversity.\n\nValues are key to understanding a culture, as they provide the 'why' behind cultural behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superior to win a negotiation. A negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain won't settle early. Knowing these cultural values before a negotiation is essential, but understanding your opponent on a personal level can also make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool has declared in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This quote is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the opening of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas adheres to this belief. Since both arguments aim to validate the same concept, we must assume, for the sake of simplicity, that their shared belief in the Bible's God is correct. This allows us to compare their arguments effectively. However, neither argument truly provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo elucidate this, let's start with St. Anselm's fundamental argument. Anselm's passage suggests a path to understanding through faith, looking inward for proof. He posits that God's existence is intrinsic to our understanding, making his nonexistence inconceivable. Although this is somewhat abstract, the core idea is that the proof for God lies within our own minds. St. Anselm believes that we don't need external evidence; we only need to examine our inherent knowledge. This concept, often referred to in Christian texts as faith, is quite different from St. Thomas Aquinas' approach.\n\nThomas Aquinas, conversely, maintains that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no reliance on faith. This could be advantageous for evangelism, as it would allow conversion without needing to accept something not proven. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof for God lies in logical necessity. For instance, if you know you're missing one puzzle piece and can assemble the rest, you know the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Around five hundred years before the Common Era, a prince was born who would later be revered as Buddha. He abandoned his worldly life to attain enlightenment, and his teachings shaped the religion of Buddhism, which today is known primarily as Theravada Buddhism. This ancient faith, now more than twenty-five hundred years old, has transformed significantly over time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, an annual water-cutting ceremony is held, a tradition that Buddha himself never taught. This illustrates how Theravada Buddhism has evolved, from superficial rituals to its core beliefs.\n\nThroughout history, both the monastic and lay communities of Theravada Buddhism have had to adapt their doctrines due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and others benign. It's crucial to understand these terms. Internal forces are those coming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status, while external forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may not directly benefit or harm the community but may do so as a side effect.\n\nLet's delve into the core tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Triple Gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These include concepts such as Anatta, or no soul, Dukkha, which is the inherent suffering in life, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these teachings can help one escape the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances. Monks follow many more rules. The central teaching is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), that attachment causes suffering, that suffering can be ended, and that the path to enlightenment is the way to overcome suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This competition reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Over the years, numerous conflicts occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing on the eve of World War I.\n\nThis isn't unique to the United States and Mexico; many neighboring nations share such rivalries. Nations sharing borders often find themselves at odds over various interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Unlike some Latin American nations, these two countries have traditionally been rivals to the United States, while others have maintained good relations. This rivalry was fueled by religious differences, with Americans and Mexicans clashing over matters of faith and culture, much like the Cold War's ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. This enmity can be traced back to the distrust between English and Spanish colonial rulers, which both nations inherited.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) record 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry, the majority of which involved territorial issues and border raids. Bandits and outlaws from American towns frequently caused problems, which persisted until both nations imposed military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) argues that the rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention (p. 109, p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession out of a deeply ingrained need for the safety and security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I grew older. So, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am: 46 years old, single, with no money in the bank, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet one truth remains. I could not have survived these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends. And trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that crises in life, big and small, are inevitable. There are no guarantees, and despite thorough preparation, some things are simply too large to overcome alone.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop relying solely on big government. Lord knows it's crumbling. Yet, I'd prefer to see Americans learn to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than each of us individually scrambling to build our own shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but the truth is, our forefathers' resilience came from compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare. I do. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove—provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why is it that organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there any limitations or constraints that steer the direction of evolutionary change? As D’Arcy Thompson famously said in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both development and evolution, for instance by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help unravel the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell shapes to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that traverses 360 degrees of space over time, creating coiled turns called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl, with the rest of the shell being referred to as the spire. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the opposite end is called the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from different angles: apical (viewing the apex), basal (viewing the base), apertural (viewing the aperture), and abapertural (viewing the aperture from the side). The usual orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective. Determine the starting point of the first suture and draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating them to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, the path of the aperture can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. While the nation has made strides towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind, raising questions about the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing on specific programs. Indonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled health workers, now reaching 72%, but this includes traditional practitioners like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions, contributing to high maternal death rates from hemorrhage. Additionally, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has decreased, indicating a concern with postnatal care, which is underreported.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, around 4%, with urban areas having a significantly higher rate of 7% compared to rural areas at 2%. This disparity highlights the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, favoring urban areas. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle to access healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering how to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system? While targeted programs offer clear, manageable objectives and quicker results, there are drawbacks. Heavy investment in one program can lead to funding shortages and resource allocation issues for other areas, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS and its impact on family planning. Furthermore, running multiple, uncoordinated programs can lead to duplicated services and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their centering on the aristocracy of the era. Two exceptions to this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both works incorporate an element of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, which are atypical of Victorian novels, further enriching the characters and providing insight into their motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, this mystery unfolds through dream sequences and dreamlike states, revealing Oliver's inner turmoil, struggles, and growing awareness of his surroundings. For instance, in Chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly as if in a dream, powerless to control the events or his own reactions. As the shooting sequence unfolds, Oliver is overwhelmed by the lack of control over his circumstances and the constant, numbing pain that accompanies his fear and despair. This reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his fate, hinting at a growing sense of defeat and resignation, possibly influenced by Fagin's manipulations. In this passage, Dickens masterfully uses these dream sequences to underscore Oliver's vulnerability and helplessness, suggesting a stark contrast between the control he desires and the reality of his situation.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. Although I tried to assist them in various subjects, my strengths were in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. At first, I was puzzled by his peculiar reading issues. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others he barely recognized. He was of Latino descent, but spoke flawless English. We kept trying until one day his mother visited. She didn’t speak a word of English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate, and that’s when it hit me: Adrian could read, but he didn’t know the English alphabet well. I hope he’s doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue, especially in California schools. It’s not always as clear as we think, even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still be a challenge. This problem is well-known, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: tutoring in English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciations. But for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes, and more is needed.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea. It benefits not just Spanish-speaking children, but all students. Research shows that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. Many fear it's a waste of resources, but that's incorrect. If implemented widely, all students would benefit. So, how do we achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that’s unrealistic. Instead, we could have bilingual special aides or tutors to assist.",
            "From our earliest days, we are told there's something greater than us, beyond what we can grasp. Some of us learn about it in Sunday schools, temples, or explore within. Many accept the religions passed down by our parents, but some reject them outright, believing our egos encompass everything. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds. Whatever path we choose reflects our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for light in the dark to guide us from shadows into sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain pounding on the tin roof, our cigarettes burning between us. Gutters gushed water, drowning the plants along the porch edge. He stared into the rain, a look of half-searching, half-remembering. His body had grown gaunt, his hair sparser than I remembered. He remained focused on the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk about how much I would miss him. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the June twilight's rain fall.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemo and radiation prolonged his suffering, but kept him alive longer than expected. I couldn't understand the value in that. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. I didn't want to witness his transition. I remembered him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for news, but no one called.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and in naming, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, and lauded for evoking the 'terrible sublime' through its use of antiquated and modern elements (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended old theatrical elements with new novelistic techniques to create a prototype for the Gothic genre. Walpole used 'old' theatrical tropes and 'new' mimetic nature in 'modern' novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often harkens back to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psychology, is what has kept Gothic alive and both obsolete and fresh to readers many centuries removed from its origins.",
            "Supply chain management is the series of processes involved in moving goods from the point of customer order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. This term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. The key elements of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these elements to provide optimal customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It serves as the foundation for the entire process. Production planning involves determining when, where, why, and how products will be made. To make informed decisions, managers look to the market, which provides insights into customer demand. Once the market analysis is complete and customer demand is understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They also decide where to produce these goods, considering factors like volume and quality, while keeping customer satisfaction in mind. After selecting the production location, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial and every detail must be meticulously planned to avoid cost and time inefficiencies. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to shipment processes, was meticulously designed to ensure smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions on core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each production process. Outsourcing work to other companies can be a core strategy to enhance velocity— the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "In the heart of Yangon, Burma, a chilling sign stands. Ellen Page, the star of \"Juno,\" holds a cardboard plaque above her head, proclaiming, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under the iron grip of a tyrannical military junta since 1962. In 2007, a series of street protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" began, led by the country's Buddhist monks. The peaceful gatherings were met with escalating violence, as the military junta invaded and plundered monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were apprehended and imprisoned, with one photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, being killed for merely attending a protest. The official death toll stands at 13, but defected Colonel Hla Win claims the true number is in the thousands.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to crush dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. From Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to Japanese emperors considered divine themselves, to our current president's weekly consultations with Ted Haggard of Stupid People Worldwide, the desire for power is a universal theme. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where an estimated 2,000-3,000 people lost their lives, and the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia and the government systematically annihilated Tutsis and political moderates. Adolf Hitler's \"Third Reich\" is another grim reminder of such atrocities.",
            "Duke Ellington’s impact on jazz was largely due to his enduring career and the creative prowess that allowed him to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s subtle presence on the piano is often understated in the selected compositions, yet as a composer, he excelled in crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He laid the foundation for soloists to freely improvise while also writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that showcased the individual styles of his band members. By emphasizing the ensemble’s tone, Ellington created cohesive and original sounds that complemented each piece. His mastery of each player’s unique sound, as well as their collective harmonies, resulted in some of jazz’s most innovative and brilliant compositions.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentioning Creole Love Call as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, featuring a twelve-bar blues structure with six choruses, is a testament to Ellington’s ability to use voice for texture and color without lyrics. Each chorus showcases a different solo, with the voice and reeds engaging in call and response, and the brass and reed sections providing counterpoint. The climactic chorus features the reeds and brass in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time, culminating in a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington’s use of voice in Creole Love Call is but one instance of his stylistic trait of adding tone color to his compositions. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his ear for tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing showcases the vocal elements in Miley’s playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone introducing the melody and adding depth to Ellington’s innovative use of voice and tone color.",
            "She had felt an unfulfilled yearning for something since she was about 14, entering the world of teenagers. Three years later, at 17, she still hadn't found anything to satisfy this desire. She longed for someone rather than a thing, but no boy had ever caught her interest. Some had tried to woo her, but none had succeeded. This peculiar situation puzzled her, and she often questioned herself about it. Years of contemplation brought up various theories, but none were satisfying enough to truly understand this strange occurrence. So, she lived her life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful, her parents being calm and good-natured. They rarely argued, even with their daughter who had a free and independent spirit. Today, however, was not a calm day. While walking from room to room in search of inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother's voice was strained and fearful.

            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, featuring higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats over saturated fats, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies have found that adhering to a Med diet is associated with lower total and cardiovascular mortality. Specifically, an intervention trial showed the Med diet promotes weight loss and reduces the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the past year. Over 95% of nurses consistently participated throughout the 20-year period, and FFQs were validated. Cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks classified this way. Factors like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated. Adjustments for confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use, were made.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, researchers examined the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, considering fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases separately.\n\nThe study found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile had lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States of America found itself in the grip of a severe financial crisis. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market went into freefall, and many of the nation's largest and most influential corporations were left in ruins. This economic downturn continues to this day, so it's imperative that we examine how this catastrophe occurred and how we can prevent a similar crisis in the future. In essence, the financial crisis was the result of self-interested and short-sighted political decisions that pressured banks and companies to offer sub-prime loans to an already shaky financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks' capital reserves were woefully inadequate, and they passed on the turmoil to the repackaged mortgages and, ultimately, to the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999. As the president sought to secure a second term, he relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move not only set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later but also laid the groundwork for a potential economic meltdown. Steven Holmes of the New York Times accurately predicted the consequences of these actions in 1999, stating, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes foretold that “the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As we now know, ill-advised lending policies would indeed lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nVarious factors combined to send the economy into a downward spiral, one of which was the introduction of complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis. These instruments intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, making households and financial markets increasingly vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions holding the bag. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a bargain, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",

Exposition is that devil whispering in your ear, urging you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the main event.

            "I tuned in to two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live segment on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), brought news of a grim incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was shown, and he appeared to be menacing. The story lasted just two minutes, enough time to convey that he had stabbed her multiple times and was in custody, which seemed reasonable given the story's early stage. The second story concerned an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was investigating, but the coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might be due to the victim being a black man or living in a black neighborhood. I've noticed this pattern before, where minority victims receive less attention in the news. The third story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, struck by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest. Another report was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, perpetrated by a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and estimated to be six feet tall and 150 pounds. The story seemed to dwell excessively on his skin color. Lastly, there was a piece about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison, which was oddly stated instead of the standard \"25 years\". His ethnicity was also mentioned, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There's a unique connection between brothers; it's unyielding, unshakable, a bond that runs deep. Within this connection lies a spectrum of emotions: love, pride, envy, and malice, among others. Brothers understand each other in ways that only those with such a link can. They see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes. When times are tough, this bond reveals its true colors, whether good or bad. The costs of these emotions are high, and so is the challenge of dealing with their consequences. When one brother looks at another, they see not just their own reflection, but their genuine self. Their actions and their outcomes define their true nature. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and its accompanying emotions. Traversing a vividly described landscape, these boys embark on a futile journey. Bitterness and intense pride collide in the story's climax, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the protagonist Doodle's direct characterization and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by Doodle and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be traced back to a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together, to their final, tragic expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother who could learn all his worldly skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" and someone to race with to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine. Doodle's frailty, however, shattered these dreams. Born with a weak heart, Doodle was unlikely to survive and even less likely to participate in strenuous activities. The young protagonist, filled with vivid imagination, was crushed. Anger even surged within him, as he contemplated smothering Doodle with a pillow—a thought that would haunt any child. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, bringing a glimmer of hope. This shows that his resolve wasn't as strong as it seemed. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, ingenious information-processing organ. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you study the brain, keep in mind that these metaphors are limited and can lead to misleading conclusions. Information processing commences with input from sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This information is repeatedly altered by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you look at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles simple details like color, orientation, and edge locations to deduce that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing enhances your recognition of the object by utilizing decisions made at earlier stages of the bottom-up process. In this example, it might help you identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the background. An attention filter then determines the importance of the signal and which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name when spoken in a noisy room. Various stages of processing occur, with the results modulated by attention repeatedly. For the brain to process information, it must first store it. Multiple types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded; for instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short duration. Information in long-term memory is thought to be preserved in the structure of certain proteins. Numerous models propose how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can further link to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley, through the pages of Brave New World, takes aim at the impending threats of technology and capitalism. He envisions a dystopian future where society prioritizes community over individuality, and from birth, individuals are conditioned to chase immediate happiness. The citizens of this world are mere pawns, controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. By applying Marxist lenses, one can discern Huxley's unease with the burgeoning economic systems of his time. Terms like homogenity and reification strengthen the idea that the novel critiques the flaws in the capitalistic framework. Capitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common folk are kept unaware of their true economic ties, focusing instead on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control, evident in the citizens' hypnopædic conditioning to consume. Hegemony is also apparent, with lower classes oblivious to their manipulation, while upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, accept their roles without resistance. The superficial interactions and lack of depth among characters suggest that technology and capitalism stifle free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, replaced by shallow, appearance-driven remarks about women and casual discussions of encounters. Each class's contentment with their status is a clear sign of capitalistic influence, showing the proletariat's false belief in their superiority so long as they consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, which translates to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, especially for those like myself who live in East Halls, the farthest eastward dorms on campus, near the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from Stuart Hall to Willard building, for instance, can take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather is bad. It wasn't always this way; not long ago, East Halls were separated from the main campus by empty land. Now, that space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments. As the campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. The solution? Bicycles. But they're only effective if students are willing to use them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nMy friend, who recently started riding again after a long break, shared his thoughts: \"Bikes are great; it's the only way to get around.\" Besides promoting physical health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can take you 30 miles. As an off-campus student, I've found the smartest decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building, a twenty-five-minute walk from my home, takes just 5 minutes on a bike. Yet, Pollock Road, the direct route, isn't always easy to travel by bike. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute to Thomas—over two and a half hours each week. And that's just for Thomas; the cumulative time spent walking for classes, appointments, and other activities would be unmanageable."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle.

Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",

I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I aim to join the Division of Family and Children Services to offer assistance to children who have been abused or neglected, and to support troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field are service, respect, a commitment to ethical practices, and a dedication to fostering positive relationships between individuals and to my own professional growth. These values are not just important in the field; they are integral to my personal belief system.\n\nFrom a young age, I've harbored a desire to help others, though I was uncertain about the path I should take. During my high school and college years, I encountered many people who avoided their problems, engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, unsure of my next steps. One fateful day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who had come to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police to his home. I visited his residence to offer assistance, and after speaking with the police, I approached his parents. They were defensive and blamed their son for involving outsiders. This experience sparked a serious consideration of a career in social work to help children navigate family conflicts.\n\nA key value in social work is social justice. Society claims to value individuality, yet we often conform to archaic traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual, and I refuse to limit myself to societal norms. Throughout my education, I protested social injustice by expressing myself through unorthodox hairstyles, attire, and piercings. I participated in the GSBA and advocated against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to fight against injustice.",
            "The following essay examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the condition insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, explores environmental influences and their impact on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The essay delves into each model, selecting research to illustrate their points and offering critical evaluations of each study's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be primary, secondary to another mental disorder, or a result of various issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while secondary sleep disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental disorders. Other categories can arise from medical conditions or substance intake. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, affect sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder. The following review focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, connecting them to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders concentrates on genetics, inherited traits, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition reduces anxiety. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that human studies could similarly benefit from this research. This study implies a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans, potentially impacting sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could naturally regulate sleep, and any receptor alteration could disturb sleep, impacting daily life tasks. This study highlights the importance of understanding genetic and environmental influences on sleep disorders.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it provides a brief overview of the condition. Secondly, it outlines the process of diagnosis, identifying common indicators or 'red flags'. Lastly, it offers suggestions for teachers working in mainstream classrooms on how to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. In simpler terms, it refers to the way the brain processes what we hear, separating words from background noise or other sounds. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but struggle with certain aspects of interpretation.\n\nThe earliest references to this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" by researchers studying children with communication difficulties. The Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests in 1954, while in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain its underlying physiology. A national conference in 1977 further fueled research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include challenges in localizing sounds, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, discerning changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm), difficulty filtering out sounds, and comprehending the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis involves observing listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using various assessment methods, including questionnaires, behavioral observations, and advanced tests that record acoustic signals within the ear. Currently, there is no single definitive test or known cause for CAPD.\n\nIn a classroom setting, teachers can support students with CAPD by providing clear instructions, simplifying language, ensuring the student is facing the speaker, using visual aids, and allowing time for processing sounds and responses. Creating a noise-free environment can also greatly help.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the notion is presented that while disguise can be a useful tool for extended deceptions, ultimately, one must shed this new persona or risk losing their true identity. However, ending a deception can be tricky, as it might lead to feelings of isolation. The decision then becomes whether to prioritize self-preservation over the preservation of relationships with others. While some may remain indifferent upon discovering the deception, others might be deeply offended by the charade. The theme of deception, particularly in regard to gender roles, is complex, especially when considering why one might choose to adopt the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola’s case, it is clear that her disguise is a means of self-preservation, as she feels compelled to masquerade as a man to protect herself in a foreign land. Viola’s plan works, but it also isolates her from her female peers and creates confusion with Olivia, who mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Furthermore, Viola struggles with her own suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino. This situation seems progressive, but to a modern audience, it may illustrate how deception can help bring to light hidden emotions, particularly in regards to Olivia and Orsino. It is possible that the characters’ subconscious desires are stirred by Viola/Cesario's appearance. For example, does Olivia’s attraction to Cesario stem from his male facade, or is she secretly drawn to women? It is likely that Olivia’s attraction is not about Cesario’s gender but rather a reflection of her societal views on appearances, as she easily shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and regards Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest.",
            "German colonial rule has been widely noted for its harshness, particularly in the context of the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. It's important to remember that no single description can encapsulate the complexity of an entire colonial empire, which varied greatly in its policies, ruling styles, and even geography. The educational landscape was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they inherited a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies also garnered praise from contemporary authors. However, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was starkly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a prominent role in educating the natives through state schools, in South West Africa, the task of educating the natives was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest significantly in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had substantial numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent educational experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans. There is a rich body of literature on education within the German colonial empire, most of which is in German and was written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily described the features of educational systems in these colonies, while later English-language works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences between the educational systems of various colonies. Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a notable example. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa accounted for many of its educational system's unique characteristics. Compared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment was reflected in the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to East Africa's 5,336 settlers.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has broadened significantly over the past century, encompassing countless genres that are now too numerous to enumerate. This is further complicated by the fact that most, if not all, genres—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has become one of the most versatile and expressive genres in the realm of popular music over the last four decades. It stands out for its wide spectrum of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side. This diversity stems from the genre's early realization of its flexibility, which has led to the creation of various sub and sub-sub genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal movement is so intricate that it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what Heavy Metal is. It has absorbed themes from various other genres, but like all movements, it has its roots. To comprehend the diverse Heavy Metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the Metal movement is and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement characterized by darkness. It's often described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It's less primitive and more technically proficient, with band members often showcasing impressive instrumental skills. It's also a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to the creation of some of the genre's most distinctive, otherworldly records, with drugs serving as a catalyst for this artistic expression. Metal possesses many dark, visceral qualities, making it distinct from much of the popular music that had primarily focused on the lighter side of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles exemplify the darker side of Metal, and it's a staple of the movement. This song, considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, was a response to a Rolling Stones song with similar heavy and dark themes. The Beatles wanted to prove their ability to match the Stones' intensity, leading to the inclusion of this track on their \"The White Album.\"",
            "Henri Rousseau, long before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, was already crafting his own dreams - his art was both a dream and a reality. \"The Dream,\" his 1910 painting, isn't just a depiction of a woman marveling at her dream landscape, but also a reflection of Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the start, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet faced a tough choice: follow established styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own path. This internal conflict is best exemplified by The Dream.\n\nTo truly understand this piece, one must first know Rousseau's story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was no stranger to hard work. He worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll collector, until he was forty, earning him the nickname douanier. Despite his lack of formal art training, painting became his solace after losing his first wife and eight children. Unlike his peers who idealized the peasant in their art, Rousseau painted from the heart, with the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nRousseau's longing for art-world acceptance is understandable given his circumstances. He began painting late in life and was surrounded by more established, famous artists. Despite his efforts, he didn't gain proper recognition until around the time Matisse was making a name for himself. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse sought to avoid clichés, Rousseau desired to create art so conventional it would earn him admission to the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I firmly believe this bond is rooted in something fundamental. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught them. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to understand and describe, rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior. Furthermore, criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate what is truly good or beautiful. For instance, discussing the Mona Lisa's value could focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but it will never fully explain why it is great art. When asked about a favorite work, it's common to hear phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more elaborate explanation. I believe that both art and morals possess this transcendental quality, which is their most powerful attribute. They cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their properties. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" The same is true for ethics. As Wittgenstein stated, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this ineffable element, is what ties ethics and aesthetics together, and this connection is even stronger in literature. As McKean noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" Living necessarily involves values, and literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.",
            "The modern Germany stands as a powerful, unified nation, a country where the blend of cultures runs from the alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, and from Köln along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural landscape is a testament to the diverse origins and tribes that have shaped Germany as we know it today.\n\nThe term \"Germania\" is the ancestral homeland of the Germans, and its origins are a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus proposed that the name came from the Tungrian Germanic tribe, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. Alternatively, Julius Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine. The word might also have come from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nTacitus, in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" written around 98 AD, described the Germans as aboriginals who did not mix with other races, suggesting that they came by sea and not land. The Romans, who considered Germania as a place of harsh conditions and unpleasant people, would not have chosen to live there. Instead, they sent their armies for goods and soldiers, but mostly returned home after their campaigns. Thus, the Germanic tribes lived on the empire's borders, trading their goods and skills, and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I gazed down, my mind blankly absorbing the scene before me. Unreactively, I silently studied it, tracing the details without getting emotionally involved. My thoughts came and went like fleeting visitors, so smoothly and effortlessly that I felt I wasn't thinking at all, just experiencing the view. Once, my colleague suggested I get \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to learn drawing. It teaches everything from understanding a pencil to understanding how our brains process lines. One technique is to frame any picture within a square, simplifying complex scenes.

Picasso's blue phase, Monet's greenery, Renaissance masters' colors... these were my artistic inspirations. Fingertips touched the brush handle, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, translating my thoughts into action. Water swirled, crystal clear and calm. A few attempts later, the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. Mop in hand, feet apart, tie uncomfortably knotted, I frowned at the mess left by a thoughtless person. A few more flushes, a few more introspective moments, then my hand grabbed the toilet paper roll, and I began mummifying it until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother preparing to pull a turkey out of the oven....",
            "Teen drivers are dying in alarming numbers. Several factors converge to create this deadly trend among young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience is also a major factor, leading to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens are significantly more likely to have accidents when they drive with peers, a practice common among them.\nStates like California have introduced temporary provisional licenses to limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are only band-aids. The real problem is that, collectively, the youngest drivers cannot effectively manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates that teens under 19-20 often seek thrills, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency diminishes. If we continue issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we'll likely see a significant increase in deadly accidents in the coming years, with the Baby Boomers' children becoming eligible to drive.\nAddressing this issue straightforwardly, schools could provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a certain number of practical driving hours required, as is currently practiced in many states, like California, which mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. A uniform, national law would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens nationwide.\nThe proposed legislation is not an innovative idea.",
            "Diving into the Library of Congress’s collection of vintage Edison films, I set my sights on the fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often employ clever editing to create illusions. My research mainly concentrated on describing the poetics of most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Most trick films from this era are rooted in a stationary proscenium set, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the one shot = one film rule. However, some daring films from the early twentieth century broke these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA distinctive aspect shared by these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining fixed in its position. This style, common in early films, draws its roots from theatre and vaudeville, and particularly from trick films. One limitation of this stage-based filming is that figures in trick films typically move side-to-side without approaching or receding from the camera. Consider the example in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move horizontally, never directly towards or away from the camera, even when they leave the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition results in long and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all Edison trick films, mirroring theatre and vaudeville practices where the entire performance was visible within the stage’s borders. Actors generally remain centered and do not move towards the camera, eliminating the possibility of close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow a pattern where one conceptual shot equates to one film, limiting their length to a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts their narrative potential; they often focus on brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. Keep in mind that in trick films, a single conceptual shot doesn’t always correspond to a physical shot. A single “shot” can actually be a combination of several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” beginning, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, from Caroline, was a devoted early advocate of Republicanism, despite his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and brief political career. His experiences in these fields shaped him into a passionate defender of personal liberties and government affairs. His commitment to an agrarian lifestyle heavily influenced his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that America's lack of established traditions provided an unparalleled chance to build a perfect system. He firmly held that natural rights are interconnected, so denying one weakens all, and they should be shielded from government interference. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a struggle for survival, but in civilization, it should not dictate social order.\n\nFor an ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledges both good and evil in humanity. He argued that as governance is human, all its virtues and vices are human. He defined good principles as those that protect property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function justly, regardless of its leadership's personal interests, which he saw as inevitable. He believed self-interest is human, but it's only considered evil when it leads to sub-societies exploiting others. A good government would control human nature, but must be monitored to prevent the adoption of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, as an extensive one could become tyrannical. However, he feared a literal interpretation without considering the writers' intent could lead to corruption. He also considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Returning to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was somewhat disheartening, but it's tough to pinpoint the exact reason. Considering that it was winter in New England, there was likely a decrease in people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December falls during the end of the fall semester, when students and faculty are busy wrapping up schoolwork and grading. The commuter log might have slipped the minds of many during this period. Furthermore, December brings the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus at all. Classes resume in late January, which might also explain the low number of logs in January. However, February's low submissions remain a mystery. It is possible that projects like this experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which led to an increase in log submissions. Thus, we faced two main challenges: maintaining project momentum during natural decreases in engagement and the inevitable breaks experienced in higher education. Another challenge was the cultural preference for driving cars, which provides freedom and flexibility. To encourage alternative commuting methods, we offered prizes like gift cards for local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the independent bookstore, and even national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, would have boosted participation. The nature of the prizes remained the same throughout the project. If we had increased the value of the prizes over time, perhaps engagement would have increased instead of decreasing. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but announcing larger prizes like bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January might have inspired more participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that aims to mirror an index, commodity, or group of assets like an index fund but offers more flexibility and trades like a stock. Like index funds, ETFs provide diversification but also allow benefits similar to single stock ownership, such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. However, they typically come with lower expense ratios than mutual funds. One downside is the commission on trades, just like with stocks. ETFs also offer a wide range of funds, which is great, but it's essential for investors to assess whether these stated benefits truly exist and to what extent. For our analysis, we'll focus on the ETF IHF and compare it with the top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF matches owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there might be better configurations for a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nGiven the complexity, we'll include only the top 10 holdings that account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here they are and their respective percentages:\n\n[REWRITE]To gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll use their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to calculate contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return. The calculations are shown below:\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% increase, and a Beta that is .12 lower than the ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with lower Beta. However, the statistical difference between these two portfolios remains uncertain.\n\nTo assess if these portfolios are statistically different, we'll determine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In \"Dream-Land\", Edgar Allan Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, a reference that's traced back to Virgil. Virgil employed this term to denote an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil's usage is certain, a more contemporary source is equally noteworthy - Poe's familiarity with the works of German authors like Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", highlights similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting Poe was indeed imitating Goethe's style. Goethe is celebrated for his poetic drama \"Faust\", published in two parts, with the second part (containing a poem titled \"The King of Thule\") published in the year of his death, 1832. This poem tells the story of a king who loses his queen and subsequently his will to live, echoing the despairing speaker of \"Dream-Land\". \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with Poe's poem mirroring Goethe's dark narrative. Poe also references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", further cementing this connection. This textual borrowing underscores Poe's admiration for Goethe, a writer he would have known through his respect for Tennyson and the widespread reproductions of German literature in the 19th century.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured by slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages if they can show that the store manager acted with malice. To succeed, the injured party must prove two things: that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct was despicable. In this case, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, can argue that the manager, Paul Martin, should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill because multiple customers were injured by slips months before Palmer's accident. Despite this knowledge, Martin failed to clean the spill, which Palmer can argue was despicable. While this argument might not be as strong, it is still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin did not take appropriate actions to maintain the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin replied that he was on dinner break and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where the central debate was whether or not Islam is inherently hostile. This question, I believe, is even more pertinent today than it was then. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in mainstream media's perception of Islam and extremism, ranging from outright hostility to extreme tolerance. I'm not sure that, in 2001, an American presidential candidate with a Muslim heritage, like Barack Obama, could have been plausible.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me, as it seems to portray a Muhammad whose character contradicts the historical accounts I've read. Traditionally, Muhammad was depicted as a conqueror who forced conversions upon captured tribes. In the biography, however, he is portrayed as a misunderstood martyr, who humbly proselytized until people spontaneously embraced his teachings. This narrative seems to diminish Muhammad's miraculous deeds, paralleling those of Jesus, and may even aim to appropriate the essence of Christ's life and teachings through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography appear to serve as proof of personal conversions, often recounted through several intermediaries. This storytelling technique, while intended to authenticate the stories,降低s their credibility, making them seem even more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me the most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine, humble, and wise figure. Historical evidence suggests a different narrative, one where Muhammad's rise to power was not characterized by gentleness and humility. I can't help but wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true background behind Muhammad's ascent.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they existed during his lifetime, have long since been left behind in the evolution of Christian thought. When we examine this history in broad strokes, we see a clear trend of Christianity moving increasingly away from its origins. Today’s world is marked by an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional individuals persist and may attempt to resist new ideas, their influence on the whole may not be significant. Among Christians, a historical consciousness will likely grow in future years. There will be a desire to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from those originally intended by the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: there will be a notable shift in the trend of Christian history. A movement will grow, removing layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock were turning backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence masses to worship as if they were living during Jesus’ time, following his teachings exclusively. The church will remain strong to guide this process, but the theological clock having moved backward will lead to greater uniformity of belief and practice, reducing diversity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see more similarities than differences. History is filled with great reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire but later became part of the empire itself. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion in Christian history will play out by undoing history in search of the source and reducing diversity. A key factor in making this process possible will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. But what has changed since Jesus’ lifetime? Looking back in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were core elements of the religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united in spirit, dividing into various groups such as Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of ordinary people.",
            "I think The Jungle reveals the inherent greed and self-centeredness of humans, with a constant drive to improve our own lives at the expense of others. The book demonstrates this through various aspects, prominently the factory owners and managers. Their sole goal is to expand and increase their businesses without regard for anyone or anything in their path, as Upton Sinclair illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" They show no concern for the pollution and the suffering of animals and people alike. The workers, too, are viewed as mere tools to fuel their profits, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They exploit their employees, forcing them to work long hours and lay them off without notice or compensation. In those times, there were few, if any, laws to protect workers' safety, allowing managers and owners to operate with impunity, pushing their workers to produce more in harsh conditions. The book hints that the workers accepted their fate, living and working in such conditions, with no agencies or organizations to assist them. Unions formed, but they often only exploited the workers further. The workers were so mistreated and trapped in the system that they were compared to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards significant subjects. Some of these methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One technique he uses is pairing unusual adjective-noun combinations to create a certain ambiance around a subject. He also assigns symbolic meanings to colors, which he then employs for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently employs this technique with numerous colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up symbolic meanings for white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke particular feelings about crucial subjects.\n\nFitzgerald associates the meaning of uniformity with white/gray, where white signifies a higher class and gray represents something older and faded. This association is established early in the novel through repeated uses of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white\" (8), and even Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party. Tom is in a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick is forming his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further emphasizes these color meanings by applying them to everyday, unimportant subjects. For instance, Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and Gatsby's party guests have \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), and many mundane people or places are described in terms of white or gray. Examples include the \"white girlhood\" (19) of Jordan and Daisy, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" (26) Italian child in the railroad, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs them to symbolize unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. The use of white and gray colors to convey this begins with Daisy. After some time with no significant use of these colors, Daisy appears \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby craves and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to intensify her feeling of uniformity. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is incredibly fertile, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations maintaining long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, allowing landowners to gain government program benefits while improving habitat quality and creating additional revenue streams through farm tours and educational programs.\n\nBesides filling a profitable niche market, organic farming typically promotes greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, it often incurs higher costs compared to conventional farming, requiring more intensive labor and management for pest and weed control, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and may result in higher losses. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of scale seen in larger operations. Moreover, practices beneficial to wildlife that are not related to organic farming can also increase labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth for specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Consequently, a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest, located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is currently under review but considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for countless centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades. I chose this land from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore cost-mitigation opportunities and wildlife-friendly operations for a small farmer. As a model of what farming this land might entail, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation. It's not just about what a culture is, but also what it's not and what it stands for. Culture isn't uniform or singular; it varies widely. Generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are oversimplifications. While understanding a culture’s common traits is useful, it's more beneficial to grasp how a culture's attitudes influence negotiations. When engaging with a foreign culture, it's natural to relate it to your own and draw comparisons.\n\nGetting to know a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Rather than trying to change a culture, one must accept it for what it is and work within its norms, especially during negotiation, especially if one has a weaker position. At an “away” negotiation, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nCulture isn't limited to national or international boundaries. Many companies within a nation have their own corporate culture. For instance, a company might prioritize long hours or have a more laid-back schedule. Evidence of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication style, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others restrict it to approved charities. Even within the same nation, corporate cultures can greatly vary—just compare different companies or regions within the U.S. to see this diversity.\n\nValues are key to understanding a culture, as they provide the 'why' behind cultural behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superior to win a negotiation. A negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain won't settle early. Knowing these cultural values before a negotiation is essential, but understanding your opponent on a personal level can also make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool has declared in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This quote is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the opening of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas adheres to this belief. Since both arguments aim to validate the same concept, we must assume, for the sake of simplicity, that their shared belief in the Bible's God is correct. This allows us to compare their arguments effectively. However, neither argument truly provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo elucidate this, let's start with St. Anselm's fundamental argument. Anselm's passage suggests a path to understanding through faith, looking inward for proof. He posits that God's existence is intrinsic to our understanding, making his nonexistence inconceivable. Although this is somewhat abstract, the core idea is that the proof for God lies within our own minds. St. Anselm believes that we don't need external evidence; we only need to examine our inherent knowledge. This concept, often referred to in Christian texts as faith, is quite different from St. Thomas Aquinas' approach.\n\nThomas Aquinas, conversely, maintains that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no reliance on faith. This could be advantageous for evangelism, as it would allow conversion without needing to accept something not proven. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof for God lies in logical necessity. For instance, if you know you're missing one puzzle piece and can assemble the rest, you know the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Around five hundred years before the Common Era, a prince was born who would later be revered as Buddha. He abandoned his worldly life to attain enlightenment, and his teachings shaped the religion of Buddhism, which today is known primarily as Theravada Buddhism. This ancient faith, now more than twenty-five hundred years old, has transformed significantly over time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, an annual water-cutting ceremony is held, a tradition that Buddha himself never taught. This illustrates how Theravada Buddhism has evolved, from superficial rituals to its core beliefs.\n\nThroughout history, both the monastic and lay communities of Theravada Buddhism have had to adapt their doctrines due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and others benign. It's crucial to understand these terms. Internal forces are those coming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status, while external forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may not directly benefit or harm the community but may do so as a side effect.\n\nLet's delve into the core tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Triple Gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These include concepts such as Anatta, or no soul, Dukkha, which is the inherent suffering in life, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these teachings can help one escape the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances. Monks follow many more rules. The central teaching is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), that attachment causes suffering, that suffering can be ended, and that the path to enlightenment is the way to overcome suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This competition reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Over the years, numerous conflicts occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing on the eve of World War I.\n\nThis isn't unique to the United States and Mexico; many neighboring nations share such rivalries. Nations sharing borders often find themselves at odds over various interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Unlike some Latin American nations, these two countries have traditionally been rivals to the United States, while others have maintained good relations. This rivalry was fueled by religious differences, with Americans and Mexicans clashing over matters of faith and culture, much like the Cold War's ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. This enmity can be traced back to the distrust between English and Spanish colonial rulers, which both nations inherited.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) record 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry, the majority of which involved territorial issues and border raids. Bandits and outlaws from American towns frequently caused problems, which persisted until both nations imposed military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) argues that the rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention (p. 109, p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession out of a deeply ingrained need for the safety and security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I grew older. So, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am: 46 years old, single, with no money in the bank, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet one truth remains. I could not have survived these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends. And trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that crises in life, big and small, are inevitable. There are no guarantees, and despite thorough preparation, some things are simply too large to overcome alone.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop relying solely on big government. Lord knows it's crumbling. Yet, I'd prefer to see Americans learn to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than each of us individually scrambling to build our own shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but the truth is, our forefathers' resilience came from compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare. I do. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove—provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why is it that organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there any limitations or constraints that steer the direction of evolutionary change? As D’Arcy Thompson famously said in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both development and evolution, for instance by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help unravel the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell shapes to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that traverses 360 degrees of space over time, creating coiled turns called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl, with the rest of the shell being referred to as the spire. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the opposite end is called the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from different angles: apical (viewing the apex), basal (viewing the base), apertural (viewing the aperture), and abapertural (viewing the aperture from the side). The usual orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective. Determine the starting point of the first suture and draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating them to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, the path of the aperture can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. While the nation has made strides towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind, raising questions about the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing on specific programs. Indonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled health workers, now reaching 72%, but this includes traditional practitioners like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions, contributing to high maternal death rates from hemorrhage. Additionally, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has decreased, indicating a concern with postnatal care, which is underreported.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, around 4%, with urban areas having a significantly higher rate of 7% compared to rural areas at 2%. This disparity highlights the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, favoring urban areas. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle to access healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering how to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system? While targeted programs offer clear, manageable objectives and quicker results, there are drawbacks. Heavy investment in one program can lead to funding shortages and resource allocation issues for other areas, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS and its impact on family planning. Furthermore, running multiple, uncoordinated programs can lead to duplicated services and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their centering on the aristocracy of the era. Two exceptions to this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both works incorporate an element of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, which are atypical of Victorian novels, further enriching the characters and providing insight into their motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, this mystery unfolds through dream sequences and dreamlike states, revealing Oliver's inner turmoil, struggles, and growing awareness of his surroundings. For instance, in Chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly as if in a dream, powerless to control the events or his own reactions. As the shooting sequence unfolds, Oliver is overwhelmed by the lack of control over his circumstances and the constant, numbing pain that accompanies his fear and despair. This reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his fate, hinting at a growing sense of defeat and resignation, possibly influenced by Fagin's manipulations. In this passage, Dickens masterfully uses these dream sequences to underscore Oliver's vulnerability and helplessness, suggesting a stark contrast between the control he desires and the reality of his situation.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. Although I tried to assist them in various subjects, my strengths were in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. At first, I was puzzled by his peculiar reading issues. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others he barely recognized. He was of Latino descent, but spoke flawless English. We kept trying until one day his mother visited. She didn’t speak a word of English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate, and that’s when it hit me: Adrian could read, but he didn’t know the English alphabet well. I hope he’s doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue, especially in California schools. It’s not always as clear as we think, even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still be a challenge. This problem is well-known, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: tutoring in English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciations. But for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes, and more is needed.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea. It benefits not just Spanish-speaking children, but all students. Research shows that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. Many fear it's a waste of resources, but that's incorrect. If implemented widely, all students would benefit. So, how do we achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that’s unrealistic. Instead, we could have bilingual special aides or tutors to assist.",
            "From our earliest days, we are told there's something greater than us, beyond what we can grasp. Some of us learn about it in Sunday schools, temples, or explore within. Many accept the religions passed down by our parents, but some reject them outright, believing our egos encompass everything. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds. Whatever path we choose reflects our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for light in the dark to guide us from shadows into sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain pounding on the tin roof, our cigarettes burning between us. Gutters gushed water, drowning the plants along the porch edge. He stared into the rain, a look of half-searching, half-remembering. His body had grown gaunt, his hair sparser than I remembered. He remained focused on the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk about how much I would miss him. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the June twilight's rain fall.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemo and radiation prolonged his suffering, but kept him alive longer than expected. I couldn't understand the value in that. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. I didn't want to witness his transition. I remembered him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for news, but no one called.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and in naming, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, and lauded for evoking the 'terrible sublime' through its use of antiquated and modern elements (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended old theatrical elements with new novelistic techniques to create a prototype for the Gothic genre. Walpole used 'old' theatrical tropes and 'new' mimetic nature in 'modern' novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often harkens back to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psychology, is what has kept Gothic alive and both obsolete and fresh to readers many centuries removed from its origins.",
            "Supply chain management is the series of processes involved in moving goods from the point of customer order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. This term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. The key elements of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these elements to provide optimal customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It serves as the foundation for the entire process. Production planning involves determining when, where, why, and how products will be made. To make informed decisions, managers look to the market, which provides insights into customer demand. Once the market analysis is complete and customer demand is understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They also decide where to produce these goods, considering factors like volume and quality, while keeping customer satisfaction in mind. After selecting the production location, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial and every detail must be meticulously planned to avoid cost and time inefficiencies. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to shipment processes, was meticulously designed to ensure smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions on core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each production process. Outsourcing work to other companies can be a core strategy to enhance velocity— the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "In the heart of Yangon, Burma, a chilling sign stands. Ellen Page, the star of \"Juno,\" holds a cardboard plaque above her head, proclaiming, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under the iron grip of a tyrannical military junta since 1962. In 2007, a series of street protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" began, led by the country's Buddhist monks. The peaceful gatherings were met with escalating violence, as the military junta invaded and plundered monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were apprehended and imprisoned, with one photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, being killed for merely attending a protest. The official death toll stands at 13, but defected Colonel Hla Win claims the true number is in the thousands.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to crush dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. From Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to Japanese emperors considered divine themselves, to our current president's weekly consultations with Ted Haggard of Stupid People Worldwide, the desire for power is a universal theme. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where an estimated 2,000-3,000 people lost their lives, and the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia and the government systematically annihilated Tutsis and political moderates. Adolf Hitler's \"Third Reich\" is another grim reminder of such atrocities.",
            "Duke Ellington’s impact on jazz was largely due to his enduring career and the creative prowess that allowed him to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s subtle presence on the piano is often understated in the selected compositions, yet as a composer, he excelled in crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He laid the foundation for soloists to freely improvise while also writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that showcased the individual styles of his band members. By emphasizing the ensemble’s tone, Ellington created cohesive and original sounds that complemented each piece. His mastery of each player’s unique sound, as well as their collective harmonies, resulted in some of jazz’s most innovative and brilliant compositions.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentioning Creole Love Call as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, featuring a twelve-bar blues structure with six choruses, is a testament to Ellington’s ability to use voice for texture and color without lyrics. Each chorus showcases a different solo, with the voice and reeds engaging in call and response, and the brass and reed sections providing counterpoint. The climactic chorus features the reeds and brass in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time, culminating in a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington’s use of voice in Creole Love Call is but one instance of his stylistic trait of adding tone color to his compositions. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his ear for tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing showcases the vocal elements in Miley’s playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone introducing the melody and adding depth to Ellington’s innovative use of voice and tone color.",
            "She had felt an unfulfilled yearning for something since she was about 14, entering the world of teenagers. Three years later, at 17, she still hadn't found anything to satisfy this desire. She longed for someone rather than a thing, but no boy had ever caught her interest. Some had tried to woo her, but none had succeeded. This peculiar situation puzzled her, and she often questioned herself about it. Years of contemplation brought up various theories, but none were satisfying enough to truly understand this strange occurrence. So, she lived her life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful, her parents being calm and good-natured. They rarely argued, even with their daughter who had a free and independent spirit. Today, however, was not a calm day. While walking from room to room in search of inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother's voice was strained and fearful. She rushed in to find her mother on the floor, in pain, and repeating \"Ow\" in short breaths. Her daughter quickly attended to her, asking, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother requested help and directed her to the car. With her mother's guidance, the daughter carried her to the vehicle, placed her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the scents of disinfectant and sickness, but her mind was focused on her mother's welfare. She rushed her mother to the doctors, who took her away for immediate examination. The daughter was left to wait, filled with worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach a high cabinet for a vase.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, featuring higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats over saturated fats, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies have found that adhering to a Med diet is associated with lower total and cardiovascular mortality. Specifically, an intervention trial showed the Med diet promotes weight loss and reduces the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the past year. Over 95% of nurses consistently participated throughout the 20-year period, and FFQs were validated. Cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks classified this way. Factors like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated. Adjustments for confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use, were made.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, researchers examined the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, considering fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases separately.\n\nThe study found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile had lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States of America found itself in the grip of a severe financial crisis. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market went into freefall, and many of the nation's largest and most influential corporations were left in ruins. This economic downturn continues to this day, so it's imperative that we examine how this catastrophe occurred and how we can prevent a similar crisis in the future. In essence, the financial crisis was the result of self-interested and short-sighted political decisions that pressured banks and companies to offer sub-prime loans to an already shaky financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks' capital reserves were woefully inadequate, and they passed on the turmoil to the repackaged mortgages and, ultimately, to the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999. As the president sought to secure a second term, he relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move not only set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later but also laid the groundwork for a potential economic meltdown. Steven Holmes of the New York Times accurately predicted the consequences of these actions in 1999, stating, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes foretold that “the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As we now know, ill-advised lending policies would indeed lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nVarious factors combined to send the economy into a downward spiral, one of which was the introduction of complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis. These instruments intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, making households and financial markets increasingly vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions holding the bag. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a bargain, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. The section of your story where you either captivate your readers or lose them to sleepy eyes and clicking \"Back\" buttons. Dr. Merlin herself has shouted at her screen when she realizes she's stuck in a mire of too much information, not even in a good way.\n\nThough we all know the rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin finds herself tripping over unnecessary blocks of text where nothing happens, or worse, everything does but in a dull manner. Exposition is that devil whispering in your ear, urging you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the main event. But in fiction, telling your audience every detail of every character's history is like serving them a bland meal when they crave a feast.\n\nLet's take an example. You're reading a story and in a few paragraphs, you learn that the heroine met her love, they married in style, and he was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire tale to be told in two pages with only two lines of dialogue from either. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loved his wife. You'd also want the heroine to reveal, through small and big ways, how his presence transformed her life. A proper introduction to him would make you mourn his death with her, making you more invested in her journey.\n\nIn short, you'd expect a hearty meal, not a bony skeleton of a story.\n\nAs a writer, you must serve that feast. (*takes a deep breath, presses onward*) It's easy to rush past certain things, like introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, was married twice, has a soft spot for Eggs Benedict, and secretly dreams of owning the place someday. Don't just tell us all these facts; show us.",
            "I tuned in to two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live segment on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), brought news of a grim incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was shown, and he appeared to be menacing. The story lasted just two minutes, enough time to convey that he had stabbed her multiple times and was in custody, which seemed reasonable given the story's early stage. The second story concerned an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was investigating, but the coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might be due to the victim being a black man or living in a black neighborhood. I've noticed this pattern before, where minority victims receive less attention in the news. The third story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, struck by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest. Another report was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, perpetrated by a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and estimated to be six feet tall and 150 pounds. The story seemed to dwell excessively on his skin color. Lastly, there was a piece about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison, which was oddly stated instead of the standard \"25 years\". His ethnicity was also mentioned, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There's a unique connection between brothers; it's unyielding, unshakable, a bond that runs deep. Within this connection lies a spectrum of emotions: love, pride, envy, and malice, among others. Brothers understand each other in ways that only those with such a link can. They see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes. When times are tough, this bond reveals its true colors, whether good or bad. The costs of these emotions are high, and so is the challenge of dealing with their consequences. When one brother looks at another, they see not just their own reflection, but their genuine self. Their actions and their outcomes define their true nature. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and its accompanying emotions. Traversing a vividly described landscape, these boys embark on a futile journey. Bitterness and intense pride collide in the story's climax, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the protagonist Doodle's direct characterization and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by Doodle and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be traced back to a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together, to their final, tragic expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother who could learn all his worldly skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" and someone to race with to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine. Doodle's frailty, however, shattered these dreams. Born with a weak heart, Doodle was unlikely to survive and even less likely to participate in strenuous activities. The young protagonist, filled with vivid imagination, was crushed. Anger even surged within him, as he contemplated smothering Doodle with a pillow—a thought that would haunt any child. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, bringing a glimmer of hope. This shows that his resolve wasn't as strong as it seemed. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, ingenious information-processing organ. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you study the brain, keep in mind that these metaphors are limited and can lead to misleading conclusions. Information processing commences with input from sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This information is repeatedly altered by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you look at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles simple details like color, orientation, and edge locations to deduce that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing enhances your recognition of the object by utilizing decisions made at earlier stages of the bottom-up process. In this example, it might help you identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the background. An attention filter then determines the importance of the signal and which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name when spoken in a noisy room. Various stages of processing occur, with the results modulated by attention repeatedly. For the brain to process information, it must first store it. Multiple types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded; for instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short duration. Information in long-term memory is thought to be preserved in the structure of certain proteins. Numerous models propose how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can further link to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley, through the pages of Brave New World, takes aim at the impending threats of technology and capitalism. He envisions a dystopian future where society prioritizes community over individuality, and from birth, individuals are conditioned to chase immediate happiness. The citizens of this world are mere pawns, controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. By applying Marxist lenses, one can discern Huxley's unease with the burgeoning economic systems of his time. Terms like homogenity and reification strengthen the idea that the novel critiques the flaws in the capitalistic framework. Capitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common folk are kept unaware of their true economic ties, focusing instead on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control, evident in the citizens' hypnopædic conditioning to consume. Hegemony is also apparent, with lower classes oblivious to their manipulation, while upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, accept their roles without resistance. The superficial interactions and lack of depth among characters suggest that technology and capitalism stifle free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, replaced by shallow, appearance-driven remarks about women and casual discussions of encounters. Each class's contentment with their status is a clear sign of capitalistic influence, showing the proletariat's false belief in their superiority so long as they consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, which translates to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, especially for those like myself who live in East Halls, the farthest eastward dorms on campus, near the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from Stuart Hall to Willard building, for instance, can take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather is bad. It wasn't always this way; not long ago, East Halls were separated from the main campus by empty land. Now, that space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments. As the campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. The solution? Bicycles. But they're only effective if students are willing to use them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nMy friend, who recently started riding again after a long break, shared his thoughts: \"Bikes are great; it's the only way to get around.\" Besides promoting physical health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can take you 30 miles. As an off-campus student, I've found the smartest decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building, a twenty-five-minute walk from my home, takes just 5 minutes on a bike. Yet, Pollock Road, the direct route, isn't always easy to travel by bike. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute to Thomas—over two and a half hours each week. And that's just for Thomas; the cumulative time spent walking for classes, appointments, and other activities would be unmanageable."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I aim to join the Division of Family and Children Services to offer assistance to children who have been abused or neglected, and to support troubled families. The values I bring to the social work field are service, respect, a commitment to ethical practices, and a dedication to fostering positive relationships between individuals and to my own professional growth. These values are not just important in the field; they are integral to my personal belief system.\n\nFrom a young age, I've harbored a desire to help others, though I was uncertain about the path I should take. During my high school and college years, I encountered many people who avoided their problems, engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences inspired me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, unsure of my next steps. One fateful day, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who had come to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police to his home. I visited his residence to offer assistance, and after speaking with the police, I approached his parents. They were defensive and blamed their son for involving outsiders. This experience sparked a serious consideration of a career in social work to help children navigate family conflicts.\n\nA key value in social work is social justice. Society claims to value individuality, yet we often conform to archaic traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual, and I refuse to limit myself to societal norms. Throughout my education, I protested social injustice by expressing myself through unorthodox hairstyles, attire, and piercings. I participated in the GSBA and advocated against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to fight against injustice.",
            "The following essay examines the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the condition insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, explores environmental influences and their impact on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The essay delves into each model, selecting research to illustrate their points and offering critical evaluations of each study's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be primary, secondary to another mental disorder, or a result of various issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while secondary sleep disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental disorders. Other categories can arise from medical conditions or substance intake. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, affect sleep initiation and maintenance, while Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder. The following review focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, connecting them to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders concentrates on genetics, inherited traits, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons responsible for sleep/wake states. Activating these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition reduces anxiety. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice, suggesting that human studies could similarly benefit from this research. This study implies a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans, potentially impacting sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could naturally regulate sleep, and any receptor alteration could disturb sleep, impacting daily life tasks. This study highlights the importance of understanding genetic and environmental influences on sleep disorders.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it provides a brief overview of the condition. Secondly, it outlines the process of diagnosis, identifying common indicators or 'red flags'. Lastly, it offers suggestions for teachers working in mainstream classrooms on how to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is defined as the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. In simpler terms, it refers to the way the brain processes what we hear, separating words from background noise or other sounds. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but struggle with certain aspects of interpretation.\n\nThe earliest references to this disorder date back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" by researchers studying children with communication difficulties. The Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing diagnostic tests in 1954, while in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain its underlying physiology. A national conference in 1977 further fueled research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include challenges in localizing sounds, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, discerning changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm), difficulty filtering out sounds, and comprehending the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis involves observing listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using various assessment methods, including questionnaires, behavioral observations, and advanced tests that record acoustic signals within the ear. Currently, there is no single definitive test or known cause for CAPD.\n\nIn a classroom setting, teachers can support students with CAPD by providing clear instructions, simplifying language, ensuring the student is facing the speaker, using visual aids, and allowing time for processing sounds and responses. Creating a noise-free environment can also greatly help.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the notion is presented that while disguise can be a useful tool for extended deceptions, ultimately, one must shed this new persona or risk losing their true identity. However, ending a deception can be tricky, as it might lead to feelings of isolation. The decision then becomes whether to prioritize self-preservation over the preservation of relationships with others. While some may remain indifferent upon discovering the deception, others might be deeply offended by the charade. The theme of deception, particularly in regard to gender roles, is complex, especially when considering why one might choose to adopt the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola’s case, it is clear that her disguise is a means of self-preservation, as she feels compelled to masquerade as a man to protect herself in a foreign land. Viola’s plan works, but it also isolates her from her female peers and creates confusion with Olivia, who mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. Furthermore, Viola struggles with her own suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino. This situation seems progressive, but to a modern audience, it may illustrate how deception can help bring to light hidden emotions, particularly in regards to Olivia and Orsino. It is possible that the characters’ subconscious desires are stirred by Viola/Cesario's appearance. For example, does Olivia’s attraction to Cesario stem from his male facade, or is she secretly drawn to women? It is likely that Olivia’s attraction is not about Cesario’s gender but rather a reflection of her societal views on appearances, as she easily shifts her affections from Cesario to Sebastian and regards Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a love interest.",
            "German colonial rule has been widely noted for its harshness, particularly in the context of the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. It's important to remember that no single description can encapsulate the complexity of an entire colonial empire, which varied greatly in its policies, ruling styles, and even geography. The educational landscape was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they inherited a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies also garnered praise from contemporary authors. However, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was starkly different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a prominent role in educating the natives through state schools, in South West Africa, the task of educating the natives was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest significantly in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies had substantial numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Several social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent educational experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native Africans. There is a rich body of literature on education within the German colonial empire, most of which is in German and was written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily described the features of educational systems in these colonies, while later English-language works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences between the educational systems of various colonies. Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a notable example. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa accounted for many of its educational system's unique characteristics. Compared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment was reflected in the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to East Africa's 5,336 settlers.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has broadened significantly over the past century, encompassing countless genres that are now too numerous to enumerate. This is further complicated by the fact that most, if not all, genres—like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. The sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has become one of the most versatile and expressive genres in the realm of popular music over the last four decades. It stands out for its wide spectrum of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side. This diversity stems from the genre's early realization of its flexibility, which has led to the creation of various sub and sub-sub genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal movement is so intricate that it's challenging to pinpoint exactly what Heavy Metal is. It has absorbed themes from various other genres, but like all movements, it has its roots. To comprehend the diverse Heavy Metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp what the Metal movement is and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement characterized by darkness. It's often described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It's less primitive and more technically proficient, with band members often showcasing impressive instrumental skills. It's also a movement deeply influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to the creation of some of the genre's most distinctive, otherworldly records, with drugs serving as a catalyst for this artistic expression. Metal possesses many dark, visceral qualities, making it distinct from much of the popular music that had primarily focused on the lighter side of the emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics like these from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles exemplify the darker side of Metal, and it's a staple of the movement. This song, considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, was a response to a Rolling Stones song with similar heavy and dark themes. The Beatles wanted to prove their ability to match the Stones' intensity, leading to the inclusion of this track on their \"The White Album.\"",
            "Henri Rousseau, long before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, was already crafting his own dreams - his art was both a dream and a reality. \"The Dream,\" his 1910 painting, isn't just a depiction of a woman marveling at her dream landscape, but also a reflection of Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the start, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet faced a tough choice: follow established styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own path. This internal conflict is best exemplified by The Dream.\n\nTo truly understand this piece, one must first know Rousseau's story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was no stranger to hard work. He worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll collector, until he was forty, earning him the nickname douanier. Despite his lack of formal art training, painting became his solace after losing his first wife and eight children. Unlike his peers who idealized the peasant in their art, Rousseau painted from the heart, with the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nRousseau's longing for art-world acceptance is understandable given his circumstances. He began painting late in life and was surrounded by more established, famous artists. Despite his efforts, he didn't gain proper recognition until around the time Matisse was making a name for himself. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse sought to avoid clichés, Rousseau desired to create art so conventional it would earn him admission to the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I firmly believe this bond is rooted in something fundamental. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught them. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to understand and describe, rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior. Furthermore, criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate what is truly good or beautiful. For instance, discussing the Mona Lisa's value could focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but it will never fully explain why it is great art. When asked about a favorite work, it's common to hear phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more elaborate explanation. I believe that both art and morals possess this transcendental quality, which is their most powerful attribute. They cannot be fully reduced to descriptions of their properties. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" The same is true for ethics. As Wittgenstein stated, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something,\" this ineffable element, is what ties ethics and aesthetics together, and this connection is even stronger in literature. As McKean noted, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" Living necessarily involves values, and literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.",
            "The modern Germany stands as a powerful, unified nation, a country where the blend of cultures runs from the alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, and from Köln along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural landscape is a testament to the diverse origins and tribes that have shaped Germany as we know it today.\n\nThe term \"Germania\" is the ancestral homeland of the Germans, and its origins are a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus proposed that the name came from the Tungrian Germanic tribe, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gauls. Alternatively, Julius Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls he had conquered and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine. The word might also have come from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nTacitus, in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" written around 98 AD, described the Germans as aboriginals who did not mix with other races, suggesting that they came by sea and not land. The Romans, who considered Germania as a place of harsh conditions and unpleasant people, would not have chosen to live there. Instead, they sent their armies for goods and soldiers, but mostly returned home after their campaigns. Thus, the Germanic tribes lived on the empire's borders, trading their goods and skills, and serving in the Roman army.",
            "I gazed down, my mind blankly absorbing the scene before me. Unreactively, I silently studied it, tracing the details without getting emotionally involved. My thoughts came and went like fleeting visitors, so smoothly and effortlessly that I felt I wasn't thinking at all, just experiencing the view. Once, my colleague suggested I get \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to learn drawing. It teaches everything from understanding a pencil to understanding how our brains process lines. One technique is to frame any picture within a square, simplifying complex scenes.

Picasso's blue phase, Monet's greenery, Renaissance masters' colors... these were my artistic inspirations. Fingertips touched the brush handle, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved, translating my thoughts into action. Water swirled, crystal clear and calm. A few attempts later, the offending brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug. Mop in hand, feet apart, tie uncomfortably knotted, I frowned at the mess left by a thoughtless person. A few more flushes, a few more introspective moments, then my hand grabbed the toilet paper roll, and I began mummifying it until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending, I slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother preparing to pull a turkey out of the oven....",
            "Teen drivers are dying in alarming numbers. Several factors converge to create this deadly trend among young American drivers. The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience is also a major factor, leading to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens are significantly more likely to have accidents when they drive with peers, a practice common among them.\nStates like California have introduced temporary provisional licenses to limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are only band-aids. The real problem is that, collectively, the youngest drivers cannot effectively manage the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman suggests that 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research indicates that teens under 19-20 often seek thrills, making it sensible to delay driving until this tendency diminishes. If we continue issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we'll likely see a significant increase in deadly accidents in the coming years, with the Baby Boomers' children becoming eligible to drive.\nAddressing this issue straightforwardly, schools could provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before a full driver's license, with a certain number of practical driving hours required, as is currently practiced in many states, like California, which mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. A uniform, national law would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens nationwide.\nThe proposed legislation is not an innovative idea.",
            "Diving into the Library of Congress’s collection of vintage Edison films, I set my sights on the fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often employ clever editing to create illusions. My research mainly concentrated on describing the poetics of most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Most trick films from this era are rooted in a stationary proscenium set, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the one shot = one film rule. However, some daring films from the early twentieth century broke these norms by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA distinctive aspect shared by these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining fixed in its position. This style, common in early films, draws its roots from theatre and vaudeville, and particularly from trick films. One limitation of this stage-based filming is that figures in trick films typically move side-to-side without approaching or receding from the camera. Consider the example in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move horizontally, never directly towards or away from the camera, even when they leave the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition results in long and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all Edison trick films, mirroring theatre and vaudeville practices where the entire performance was visible within the stage’s borders. Actors generally remain centered and do not move towards the camera, eliminating the possibility of close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow a pattern where one conceptual shot equates to one film, limiting their length to a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts their narrative potential; they often focus on brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. Keep in mind that in trick films, a single conceptual shot doesn’t always correspond to a physical shot. A single “shot” can actually be a combination of several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer look reveals the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” beginning, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, from Caroline, was a devoted early advocate of Republicanism, despite his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and brief political career. His experiences in these fields shaped him into a passionate defender of personal liberties and government affairs. His commitment to an agrarian lifestyle heavily influenced his views on governance, sovereignty, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that America's lack of established traditions provided an unparalleled chance to build a perfect system. He firmly held that natural rights are interconnected, so denying one weakens all, and they should be shielded from government interference. He viewed the \"state of nature\" as a struggle for survival, but in civilization, it should not dictate social order.\n\nFor an ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledges both good and evil in humanity. He argued that as governance is human, all its virtues and vices are human. He defined good principles as those that protect property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function justly, regardless of its leadership's personal interests, which he saw as inevitable. He believed self-interest is human, but it's only considered evil when it leads to sub-societies exploiting others. A good government would control human nature, but must be monitored to prevent the adoption of bad principles.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated in the Constitution, as an extensive one could become tyrannical. However, he feared a literal interpretation without considering the writers' intent could lead to corruption. He also considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Returning to Figure 17, there was a sharp decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was somewhat disheartening, but it's tough to pinpoint the exact reason. Considering that it was winter in New England, there was likely a decrease in people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December falls during the end of the fall semester, when students and faculty are busy wrapping up schoolwork and grading. The commuter log might have slipped the minds of many during this period. Furthermore, December brings the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus at all. Classes resume in late January, which might also explain the low number of logs in January. However, February's low submissions remain a mystery. It is possible that projects like this experience an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which led to an increase in log submissions. Thus, we faced two main challenges: maintaining project momentum during natural decreases in engagement and the inevitable breaks experienced in higher education. Another challenge was the cultural preference for driving cars, which provides freedom and flexibility. To encourage alternative commuting methods, we offered prizes like gift cards for local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the independent bookstore, and even national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, would have boosted participation. The nature of the prizes remained the same throughout the project. If we had increased the value of the prizes over time, perhaps engagement would have increased instead of decreasing. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but announcing larger prizes like bicycles in December and hybrid or electric cars in January might have inspired more participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that aims to mirror an index, commodity, or group of assets like an index fund but offers more flexibility and trades like a stock. Like index funds, ETFs provide diversification but also allow benefits similar to single stock ownership, such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. However, they typically come with lower expense ratios than mutual funds. One downside is the commission on trades, just like with stocks. ETFs also offer a wide range of funds, which is great, but it's essential for investors to assess whether these stated benefits truly exist and to what extent. For our analysis, we'll focus on the ETF IHF and compare it with the top 10 holdings to determine if owning a single ETF matches owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there might be better configurations for a more optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nGiven the complexity, we'll include only the top 10 holdings that account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Here they are and their respective percentages:\n\n[REWRITE]To gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll use their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to calculate contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return. The calculations are shown below:\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% increase, and a Beta that is .12 lower than the ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could offer higher returns with lower Beta. However, the statistical difference between these two portfolios remains uncertain.\n\nTo assess if these portfolios are statistically different, we'll determine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In \"Dream-Land\", Edgar Allan Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, a reference that's traced back to Virgil. Virgil employed this term to denote an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil's usage is certain, a more contemporary source is equally noteworthy - Poe's familiarity with the works of German authors like Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\", highlights similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting Poe was indeed imitating Goethe's style. Goethe is celebrated for his poetic drama \"Faust\", published in two parts, with the second part (containing a poem titled \"The King of Thule\") published in the year of his death, 1832. This poem tells the story of a king who loses his queen and subsequently his will to live, echoing the despairing speaker of \"Dream-Land\". \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with Poe's poem mirroring Goethe's dark narrative. Poe also references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", further cementing this connection. This textual borrowing underscores Poe's admiration for Goethe, a writer he would have known through his respect for Tennyson and the widespread reproductions of German literature in the 19th century.",
            "Under California law, a customer injured by slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store could potentially be awarded punitive damages if they can show that the store manager acted with malice. To succeed, the injured party must prove two things: that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result, and that the conduct was despicable. In this case, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, can argue that the manager, Paul Martin, should have known about the potential harm of not cleaning the spill because multiple customers were injured by slips months before Palmer's accident. Despite this knowledge, Martin failed to clean the spill, which Palmer can argue was despicable. While this argument might not be as strong, it is still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin did not take appropriate actions to maintain the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill. Martin replied that he was on dinner break and didn't have time to deal with customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where the central debate was whether or not Islam is inherently hostile. This question, I believe, is even more pertinent today than it was then. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in mainstream media's perception of Islam and extremism, ranging from outright hostility to extreme tolerance. I'm not sure that, in 2001, an American presidential candidate with a Muslim heritage, like Barack Obama, could have been plausible.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me, as it seems to portray a Muhammad whose character contradicts the historical accounts I've read. Traditionally, Muhammad was depicted as a conqueror who forced conversions upon captured tribes. In the biography, however, he is portrayed as a misunderstood martyr, who humbly proselytized until people spontaneously embraced his teachings. This narrative seems to diminish Muhammad's miraculous deeds, paralleling those of Jesus, and may even aim to appropriate the essence of Christ's life and teachings through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography appear to serve as proof of personal conversions, often recounted through several intermediaries. This storytelling technique, while intended to authenticate the stories,降低s their credibility, making them seem even more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me the most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine, humble, and wise figure. Historical evidence suggests a different narrative, one where Muhammad's rise to power was not characterized by gentleness and humility. I can't help but wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true background behind Muhammad's ascent.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they existed during his lifetime, have long since been left behind in the evolution of Christian thought. When we examine this history in broad strokes, we see a clear trend of Christianity moving increasingly away from its origins. Today’s world is marked by an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional individuals persist and may attempt to resist new ideas, their influence on the whole may not be significant. Among Christians, a historical consciousness will likely grow in future years. There will be a desire to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from those originally intended by the religion’s namesake. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: there will be a notable shift in the trend of Christian history. A movement will grow, removing layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock were turning backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence masses to worship as if they were living during Jesus’ time, following his teachings exclusively. The church will remain strong to guide this process, but the theological clock having moved backward will lead to greater uniformity of belief and practice, reducing diversity. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see more similarities than differences. History is filled with great reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire but later became part of the empire itself. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming great reversion in Christian history will play out by undoing history in search of the source and reducing diversity. A key factor in making this process possible will be interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. But what has changed since Jesus’ lifetime? Looking back in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were core elements of the religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united in spirit, dividing into various groups such as Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of ordinary people.",
            "I think The Jungle reveals the inherent greed and self-centeredness of humans, with a constant drive to improve our own lives at the expense of others. The book demonstrates this through various aspects, prominently the factory owners and managers. Their sole goal is to expand and increase their businesses without regard for anyone or anything in their path, as Upton Sinclair illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" They show no concern for the pollution and the suffering of animals and people alike. The workers, too, are viewed as mere tools to fuel their profits, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They exploit their employees, forcing them to work long hours and lay them off without notice or compensation. In those times, there were few, if any, laws to protect workers' safety, allowing managers and owners to operate with impunity, pushing their workers to produce more in harsh conditions. The book hints that the workers accepted their fate, living and working in such conditions, with no agencies or organizations to assist them. Unions formed, but they often only exploited the workers further. The workers were so mistreated and trapped in the system that they were compared to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes in their readers towards significant subjects. Some of these methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. One technique he uses is pairing unusual adjective-noun combinations to create a certain ambiance around a subject. He also assigns symbolic meanings to colors, which he then employs for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently employs this technique with numerous colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up symbolic meanings for white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke particular feelings about crucial subjects.\n\nFitzgerald associates the meaning of uniformity with white/gray, where white signifies a higher class and gray represents something older and faded. This association is established early in the novel through repeated uses of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as \"in white\" (8), and even Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party. Tom is in a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick is forming his initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further emphasizes these color meanings by applying them to everyday, unimportant subjects. For instance, Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and Gatsby's party guests have \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), and many mundane people or places are described in terms of white or gray. Examples include the \"white girlhood\" (19) of Jordan and Daisy, the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" (26) Italian child in the railroad, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs them to symbolize unimportance or uniformity of certain subjects. The use of white and gray colors to convey this begins with Daisy. After some time with no significant use of these colors, Daisy appears \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby craves and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to intensify her feeling of uniformity. For example, there is a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), and she is again in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is incredibly fertile, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a significant demand for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations maintaining long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, allowing landowners to gain government program benefits while improving habitat quality and creating additional revenue streams through farm tours and educational programs.\n\nBesides filling a profitable niche market, organic farming typically promotes greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, it often incurs higher costs compared to conventional farming, requiring more intensive labor and management for pest and weed control, and soil fertilization without chemicals, and may result in higher losses. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of scale seen in larger operations. Moreover, practices beneficial to wildlife that are not related to organic farming can also increase labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth for specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Consequently, a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to the Cleveland National Forest, located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is currently under review but considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, like burrowing owls.\n\nThis area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for countless centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many decades. I chose this land from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore cost-mitigation opportunities and wildlife-friendly operations for a small farmer. As a model of what farming this land might entail, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Culture is a crucial factor in any negotiation. It's not just about what a culture is, but also what it's not and what it stands for. Culture isn't uniform or singular; it varies widely. Generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are oversimplifications. While understanding a culture’s common traits is useful, it's more beneficial to grasp how a culture's attitudes influence negotiations. When engaging with a foreign culture, it's natural to relate it to your own and draw comparisons.\n\nGetting to know a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Rather than trying to change a culture, one must accept it for what it is and work within its norms, especially during negotiation, especially if one has a weaker position. At an “away” negotiation, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and advance the negotiation.\n\nCulture isn't limited to national or international boundaries. Many companies within a nation have their own corporate culture. For instance, a company might prioritize long hours or have a more laid-back schedule. Evidence of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication style, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy, while others restrict it to approved charities. Even within the same nation, corporate cultures can greatly vary—just compare different companies or regions within the U.S. to see this diversity.\n\nValues are key to understanding a culture, as they provide the 'why' behind cultural behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superior to win a negotiation. A negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain won't settle early. Knowing these cultural values before a negotiation is essential, but understanding your opponent on a personal level can also make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool has declared in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This quote is first found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and is the opening of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God. Similarly, Thomas Aquinas adheres to this belief. Since both arguments aim to validate the same concept, we must assume, for the sake of simplicity, that their shared belief in the Bible's God is correct. This allows us to compare their arguments effectively. However, neither argument truly provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nTo elucidate this, let's start with St. Anselm's fundamental argument. Anselm's passage suggests a path to understanding through faith, looking inward for proof. He posits that God's existence is intrinsic to our understanding, making his nonexistence inconceivable. Although this is somewhat abstract, the core idea is that the proof for God lies within our own minds. St. Anselm believes that we don't need external evidence; we only need to examine our inherent knowledge. This concept, often referred to in Christian texts as faith, is quite different from St. Thomas Aquinas' approach.\n\nThomas Aquinas, conversely, maintains that God's existence can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no reliance on faith. This could be advantageous for evangelism, as it would allow conversion without needing to accept something not proven. Thomas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the proof for God lies in logical necessity. For instance, if you know you're missing one puzzle piece and can assemble the rest, you know the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Around five hundred years before the Common Era, a prince was born who would later be revered as Buddha. He abandoned his worldly life to attain enlightenment, and his teachings shaped the religion of Buddhism, which today is known primarily as Theravada Buddhism. This ancient faith, now more than twenty-five hundred years old, has transformed significantly over time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, an annual water-cutting ceremony is held, a tradition that Buddha himself never taught. This illustrates how Theravada Buddhism has evolved, from superficial rituals to its core beliefs.\n\nThroughout history, both the monastic and lay communities of Theravada Buddhism have had to adapt their doctrines due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and others benign. It's crucial to understand these terms. Internal forces are those coming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's monastic status, while external forces are from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, on the other hand, may not directly benefit or harm the community but may do so as a side effect.\n\nLet's delve into the core tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the Triple Gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These include concepts such as Anatta, or no soul, Dukkha, which is the inherent suffering in life, and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Recognizing these teachings can help one escape the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances. Monks follow many more rules. The central teaching is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), that attachment causes suffering, that suffering can be ended, and that the path to enlightenment is the way to overcome suffering.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This competition reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Over the years, numerous conflicts occurred between the two nations, with tensions finally easing on the eve of World War I.\n\nThis isn't unique to the United States and Mexico; many neighboring nations share such rivalries. Nations sharing borders often find themselves at odds over various interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Unlike some Latin American nations, these two countries have traditionally been rivals to the United States, while others have maintained good relations. This rivalry was fueled by religious differences, with Americans and Mexicans clashing over matters of faith and culture, much like the Cold War's ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. This enmity can be traced back to the distrust between English and Spanish colonial rulers, which both nations inherited.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) record 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry, the majority of which involved territorial issues and border raids. Bandits and outlaws from American towns frequently caused problems, which persisted until both nations imposed military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) argues that the rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention (p. 109, p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession out of a deeply ingrained need for the safety and security I lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I grew older. So, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am: 46 years old, single, with no money in the bank, and unable to work. To this day, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet one truth remains. I could not have survived these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends. And trust me, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that crises in life, big and small, are inevitable. There are no guarantees, and despite thorough preparation, some things are simply too large to overcome alone.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop relying solely on big government. Lord knows it's crumbling. Yet, I'd prefer to see Americans learn to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than each of us individually scrambling to build our own shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. talk about \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but the truth is, our forefathers' resilience came from compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, prepare. I do. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove—provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why is it that organisms evolve in the way they do? Are there any limitations or constraints that steer the direction of evolutionary change? As D’Arcy Thompson famously said in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both development and evolution, for instance by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help unravel the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We modeled hypothetical shell shapes to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that traverses 360 degrees of space over time, creating coiled turns called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl, with the rest of the shell being referred to as the spire. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the opposite end is called the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from different angles: apical (viewing the apex), basal (viewing the base), apertural (viewing the aperture), and abapertural (viewing the aperture from the side). The usual orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, begin by viewing the shell from the apical perspective. Determine the starting point of the first suture and draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating them to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, the path of the aperture can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "The rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. While the nation has made strides towards achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress in child and maternal health lags behind, raising questions about the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing on specific programs. Indonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled health workers, now reaching 72%, but this includes traditional practitioners like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions, contributing to high maternal death rates from hemorrhage. Additionally, the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional has decreased, indicating a concern with postnatal care, which is underreported.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, around 4%, with urban areas having a significantly higher rate of 7% compared to rural areas at 2%. This disparity highlights the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, favoring urban areas. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle to access healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering how to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system? While targeted programs offer clear, manageable objectives and quicker results, there are drawbacks. Heavy investment in one program can lead to funding shortages and resource allocation issues for other areas, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS and its impact on family planning. Furthermore, running multiple, uncoordinated programs can lead to duplicated services and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their centering on the aristocracy of the era. Two exceptions to this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both works incorporate an element of mystery and a flair for the bizarre, which are atypical of Victorian novels, further enriching the characters and providing insight into their motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, this mystery unfolds through dream sequences and dreamlike states, revealing Oliver's inner turmoil, struggles, and growing awareness of his surroundings. For instance, in Chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly as if in a dream, powerless to control the events or his own reactions. As the shooting sequence unfolds, Oliver is overwhelmed by the lack of control over his circumstances and the constant, numbing pain that accompanies his fear and despair. This reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his fate, hinting at a growing sense of defeat and resignation, possibly influenced by Fagin's manipulations. In this passage, Dickens masterfully uses these dream sequences to underscore Oliver's vulnerability and helplessness, suggesting a stark contrast between the control he desires and the reality of his situation.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged students. Although I tried to assist them in various subjects, my strengths were in English and reading. I was approached by one of the instructors to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. At first, I was puzzled by his peculiar reading issues. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others he barely recognized. He was of Latino descent, but spoke flawless English. We kept trying until one day his mother visited. She didn’t speak a word of English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate, and that’s when it hit me: Adrian could read, but he didn’t know the English alphabet well. I hope he’s doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue, especially in California schools. It’s not always as clear as we think, even for a child who speaks perfect English, reading can still be a challenge. This problem is well-known, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: tutoring in English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciations. But for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes, and more is needed.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea. It benefits not just Spanish-speaking children, but all students. Research shows that children in such programs outperform their peers academically. Many fear it's a waste of resources, but that's incorrect. If implemented widely, all students would benefit. So, how do we achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that’s unrealistic. Instead, we could have bilingual special aides or tutors to assist.",
            "From our earliest days, we are told there's something greater than us, beyond what we can grasp. Some of us learn about it in Sunday schools, temples, or explore within. Many accept the religions passed down by our parents, but some reject them outright, believing our egos encompass everything. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds. Whatever path we choose reflects our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for light in the dark to guide us from shadows into sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said when I asked his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain pounding on the tin roof, our cigarettes burning between us. Gutters gushed water, drowning the plants along the porch edge. He stared into the rain, a look of half-searching, half-remembering. His body had grown gaunt, his hair sparser than I remembered. He remained focused on the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk about how much I would miss him. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the June twilight's rain fall.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemo and radiation prolonged his suffering, but kept him alive longer than expected. I couldn't understand the value in that. If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. I didn't want to witness his transition. I remembered him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for news, but no one called.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence and in naming, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New'\" as Ian Watt describes in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, and lauded for evoking the 'terrible sublime' through its use of antiquated and modern elements (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended old theatrical elements with new novelistic techniques to create a prototype for the Gothic genre. Walpole used 'old' theatrical tropes and 'new' mimetic nature in 'modern' novels to present what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often harkens back to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psychology, is what has kept Gothic alive and both obsolete and fresh to readers many centuries removed from its origins.",
            "Supply chain management is the series of processes involved in moving goods from the point of customer order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution to the customer. This term was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. The key elements of supply chain management include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these elements to provide optimal customer service.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain. It serves as the foundation for the entire process. Production planning involves determining when, where, why, and how products will be made. To make informed decisions, managers look to the market, which provides insights into customer demand. Once the market analysis is complete and customer demand is understood, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. They also decide where to produce these goods, considering factors like volume and quality, while keeping customer satisfaction in mind. After selecting the production location, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is crucial and every detail must be meticulously planned to avoid cost and time inefficiencies. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to shipment processes, was meticulously designed to ensure smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions on core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division is best suited for each production process. Outsourcing work to other companies can be a core strategy to enhance velocity— the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "In the heart of Yangon, Burma, a chilling sign stands. Ellen Page, the star of \"Juno,\" holds a cardboard plaque above her head, proclaiming, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under the iron grip of a tyrannical military junta since 1962. In 2007, a series of street protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" began, led by the country's Buddhist monks. The peaceful gatherings were met with escalating violence, as the military junta invaded and plundered monasteries across the country. Foreign journalists were apprehended and imprisoned, with one photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, being killed for merely attending a protest. The official death toll stands at 13, but defected Colonel Hla Win claims the true number is in the thousands.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to crush dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. From Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to Japanese emperors considered divine themselves, to our current president's weekly consultations with Ted Haggard of Stupid People Worldwide, the desire for power is a universal theme. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where an estimated 2,000-3,000 people lost their lives, and the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia and the government systematically annihilated Tutsis and political moderates. Adolf Hitler's \"Third Reich\" is another grim reminder of such atrocities.",
            "Duke Ellington’s impact on jazz was largely due to his enduring career and the creative prowess that allowed him to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s subtle presence on the piano is often understated in the selected compositions, yet as a composer, he excelled in crafting intricate pieces that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He laid the foundation for soloists to freely improvise while also writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that showcased the individual styles of his band members. By emphasizing the ensemble’s tone, Ellington created cohesive and original sounds that complemented each piece. His mastery of each player’s unique sound, as well as their collective harmonies, resulted in some of jazz’s most innovative and brilliant compositions.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentioning Creole Love Call as an early example of his use of voice as a jazz instrument. This piece, featuring a twelve-bar blues structure with six choruses, is a testament to Ellington’s ability to use voice for texture and color without lyrics. Each chorus showcases a different solo, with the voice and reeds engaging in call and response, and the brass and reed sections providing counterpoint. The climactic chorus features the reeds and brass in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time, culminating in a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending.\n\nEllington’s use of voice in Creole Love Call is but one instance of his stylistic trait of adding tone color to his compositions. In Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, Ellington combines his orchestration skills with his ear for tone color. A call and response between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing showcases the vocal elements in Miley’s playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone introducing the melody and adding depth to Ellington’s innovative use of voice and tone color.",
            "She had felt an unfulfilled yearning for something since she was about 14, entering the world of teenagers. Three years later, at 17, she still hadn't found anything to satisfy this desire. She longed for someone rather than a thing, but no boy had ever caught her interest. Some had tried to woo her, but none had succeeded. This peculiar situation puzzled her, and she often questioned herself about it. Years of contemplation brought up various theories, but none were satisfying enough to truly understand this strange occurrence. So, she lived her life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually peaceful, her parents being calm and good-natured. They rarely argued, even with their daughter who had a free and independent spirit. Today, however, was not a calm day. While walking from room to room in search of inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother's voice was strained and fearful. She rushed in to find her mother on the floor, in pain, and repeating \"Ow\" in short breaths. Her daughter quickly attended to her, asking, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother requested help and directed her to the car. With her mother's guidance, the daughter carried her to the vehicle, placed her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the scents of disinfectant and sickness, but her mind was focused on her mother's welfare. She rushed her mother to the doctors, who took her away for immediate examination. The daughter was left to wait, filled with worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach a high cabinet for a vase.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is linked to a reduced risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, featuring higher consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats over saturated fats, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies have found that adhering to a Med diet is associated with lower total and cardiovascular mortality. Specifically, an intervention trial showed the Med diet promotes weight loss and reduces the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake over the past year. Over 95% of nurses consistently participated throughout the 20-year period, and FFQs were validated. Cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal heart attacks classified this way. Factors like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated. Adjustments for confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use, were made.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, researchers examined the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, considering fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases separately.\n\nThe study found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed quintile had lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States of America found itself in the grip of a severe financial crisis. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market went into freefall, and many of the nation's largest and most influential corporations were left in ruins. This economic downturn continues to this day, so it's imperative that we examine how this catastrophe occurred and how we can prevent a similar crisis in the future. In essence, the financial crisis was the result of self-interested and short-sighted political decisions that pressured banks and companies to offer sub-prime loans to an already shaky financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into complex financial instruments known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks' capital reserves were woefully inadequate, and they passed on the turmoil to the repackaged mortgages and, ultimately, to the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999. As the president sought to secure a second term, he relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move not only set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later but also laid the groundwork for a potential economic meltdown. Steven Holmes of the New York Times accurately predicted the consequences of these actions in 1999, stating, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes foretold that “the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As we now know, ill-advised lending policies would indeed lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nVarious factors combined to send the economy into a downward spiral, one of which was the introduction of complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis. These instruments intertwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market, making households and financial markets increasingly vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions holding the bag. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a bargain, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. The section of your story where you either captivate your readers or lose them to sleepy eyes and clicking \"Back\" buttons. Dr. Merlin herself has shouted at her screen when she realizes she's stuck in a mire of too much information, not even in a good way.\n\nThough we all know the rule, \"Show, don't tell,\" Dr. Merlin finds herself tripping over unnecessary blocks of text where nothing happens, or worse, everything does but in a dull manner. Exposition is that devil whispering in your ear, urging you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the main event. But in fiction, telling your audience every detail of every character's history is like serving them a bland meal when they crave a feast.\n\nLet's take an example. You're reading a story and in a few paragraphs, you learn that the heroine met her love, they married in style, and he was murdered before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire tale to be told in two pages with only two lines of dialogue from either. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loved his wife. You'd also want the heroine to reveal, through small and big ways, how his presence transformed her life. A proper introduction to him would make you mourn his death with her, making you more invested in her journey.\n\nIn short, you'd expect a hearty meal, not a bony skeleton of a story.\n\nAs a writer, you must serve that feast. (*takes a deep breath, presses onward*) It's easy to rush past certain things, like introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, was married twice, has a soft spot for Eggs Benedict, and secretly dreams of owning the place someday. Don't just tell us all these facts; show us.",
            "I tuned in to two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live segment on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), brought news of a grim incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was shown, and he appeared to be menacing. The story lasted just two minutes, enough time to convey that he had stabbed her multiple times and was in custody, which seemed reasonable given the story's early stage. The second story concerned an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was investigating, but the coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might be due to the victim being a black man or living in a black neighborhood. I've noticed this pattern before, where minority victims receive less attention in the news. The third story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, struck by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest. Another report was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, perpetrated by a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and estimated to be six feet tall and 150 pounds. The story seemed to dwell excessively on his skin color. Lastly, there was a piece about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison, which was oddly stated instead of the standard \"25 years\". His ethnicity was also mentioned, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There's a unique connection between brothers; it's unyielding, unshakable, a bond that runs deep. Within this connection lies a spectrum of emotions: love, pride, envy, and malice, among others. Brothers understand each other in ways that only those with such a link can. They see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes. When times are tough, this bond reveals its true colors, whether good or bad. The costs of these emotions are high, and so is the challenge of dealing with their consequences. When one brother looks at another, they see not just their own reflection, but their genuine self. Their actions and their outcomes define their true nature. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and its accompanying emotions. Traversing a vividly described landscape, these boys embark on a futile journey. Bitterness and intense pride collide in the story's climax, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the protagonist Doodle's direct characterization and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by Doodle and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be traced back to a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together, to their final, tragic expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother who could learn all his worldly skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" and someone to race with to Horsehead Landing and perch with in the great pine. Doodle's frailty, however, shattered these dreams. Born with a weak heart, Doodle was unlikely to survive and even less likely to participate in strenuous activities. The young protagonist, filled with vivid imagination, was crushed. Anger even surged within him, as he contemplated smothering Doodle with a pillow—a thought that would haunt any child. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him, bringing a glimmer of hope. This shows that his resolve wasn't as strong as it seemed. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, ingenious information-processing organ. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you study the brain, keep in mind that these metaphors are limited and can lead to misleading conclusions. Information processing commences with input from sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This information is repeatedly altered by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you look at an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles simple details like color, orientation, and edge locations to deduce that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing enhances your recognition of the object by utilizing decisions made at earlier stages of the bottom-up process. In this example, it might help you identify it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the background. An attention filter then determines the importance of the signal and which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name when spoken in a noisy room. Various stages of processing occur, with the results modulated by attention repeatedly. For the brain to process information, it must first store it. Multiple types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded; for instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a short duration. Information in long-term memory is thought to be preserved in the structure of certain proteins. Numerous models propose how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, with nodes linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can further link to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley, through the pages of Brave New World, takes aim at the impending threats of technology and capitalism. He envisions a dystopian future where society prioritizes community over individuality, and from birth, individuals are conditioned to chase immediate happiness. The citizens of this world are mere pawns, controlled by the World Controller, who dictates a singular ideology. By applying Marxist lenses, one can discern Huxley's unease with the burgeoning economic systems of his time. Terms like homogenity and reification strengthen the idea that the novel critiques the flaws in the capitalistic framework. Capitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common folk are kept unaware of their true economic ties, focusing instead on personal gain. This is achieved through ideological control, evident in the citizens' hypnopædic conditioning to consume. Hegemony is also apparent, with lower classes oblivious to their manipulation, while upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, accept their roles without resistance. The superficial interactions and lack of depth among characters suggest that technology and capitalism stifle free will and expression. Love and strong emotions are absent, replaced by shallow, appearance-driven remarks about women and casual discussions of encounters. Each class's contentment with their status is a clear sign of capitalistic influence, showing the proletariat's false belief in their superiority so long as they consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, which translates to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, especially for those like myself who live in East Halls, the farthest eastward dorms on campus, near the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from Stuart Hall to Willard building, for instance, can take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather is bad. It wasn't always this way; not long ago, East Halls were separated from the main campus by empty land. Now, that space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments. As the campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. The solution? Bicycles. But they're only effective if students are willing to use them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nMy friend, who recently started riding again after a long break, shared his thoughts: \"Bikes are great; it's the only way to get around.\" Besides promoting physical health, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can take you 30 miles. As an off-campus student, I've found the smartest decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building, a twenty-five-minute walk from my home, takes just 5 minutes on a bike. Yet, Pollock Road, the direct route, isn't always easy to travel by bike. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute to Thomas—over two and a half hours each week. And that's just for Thomas; the cumulative time spent walking for classes, appointments, and other activities would be unmanageable."
