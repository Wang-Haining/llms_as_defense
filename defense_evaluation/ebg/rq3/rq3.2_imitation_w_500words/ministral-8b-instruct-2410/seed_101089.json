            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

The values I bring to the field include service, respect, ethical practice, commitment to strengthening relationships, and a dedication to professional growth to remain skilled. These are not just professional values; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nGrowing up, I've always desired to assist others, but I was uncertain about my career path. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people retreat from their problems in denial and some used coping strategies that weren't ideal. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still undecided about my career, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. To assist, I drove to his parents’ house, where I privately shared my concerns with the police. They asked me to speak with the parents, as they were powerless to intervene. When I questioned the parents about their son’s behavior, they seemed defensive and blamed him for involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes. This experience sparked my interest in social work to help children with family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. Society claims to value individuals but often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual and reject limiting myself to fit into others' molds. Throughout high school and college, I protested social injustice: I colored my hair unnatural colors, wore expressive clothing, pierced my ears beyond the norm, joined the GSBA, and fought against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "This document explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic factors and medical aspects that influence sleep disorders. On the other hand, the Sociocultural model investigates the environmental influences that relate to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review that follows examines these models and presents research that pertains to and elucidates them. The research findings are then critically evaluated to highlight their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia, a sleep disorder, can be categorized as either a primary sleep disorder, one related to another mental disorder, or one stemming from medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders fall under Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Other categories encompass sleep disorders due to medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias, which include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), pertain to issues with initiating or maintaining sleep. Primary Insomnia, for instance, is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia refers to difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve sleep disorders linked to behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, inherited factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence of this receptor could alter one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The Sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, it could regulate sleep. An alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual, negatively impacting aspects of life such as school, career, and everyday tasks that require focus.",
            "This document delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the condition. It then outlines the diagnostic process, highlighting common symptoms, or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it concludes with strategies for teachers working in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Simply put, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly process sounds, distinguishing words from background noise, despite normal hearing. Individuals with CAPD can hear perfectly but face difficulties in the brain's processing of what they hear.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954. Kimura introduced dichotic testing and explained the physiological basis of the central nervous system's role in dichotic perception in 1961. A 1977 national conference further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents in various forms, including difficulty in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and synthesizing sound clues meaningfully. It can also manifest as a struggle to determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists use various measures to assess auditory-related skills. There is no single, consistently reliable test, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown. Tests typically present multiple auditory stimuli and ask for differentiation. Advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night teaches that while disguise can be a powerful tool to maintain deception for extended periods, it ultimately requires the wearer to shed that false persona to prevent losing one's true self. The challenge lies in ending the charade, as it may lead to feelings of alienation. One must then choose between preserving self-identity or maintaining relationships. Some may accept the deception without issue, but others might be offended. The theme of gender role reversal in deception is complex, raising questions like why someone might feel the need to assume an opposite-gender guise. In Viola’s case, it's a form of self-defense: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola masquerades as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. Her scheme works, but it isolates her from the female community, and she finds herself in a romantic turmoil with Olivia and Orsino: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) While this could be seen as progressive, to a modern reader, Twelfth Night might demonstrate how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Unshed feelings may be forced to the surface due to Viola/Cesario's presence. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because she thinks he's a man, or does she secretly harbor affection for women? It seems unlikely, as Olivia's character seems to mock those who judge others solely on appearance. This is evident in her quick shift from Cesario to Sebastian, and her familial acceptance of Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has long been criticized for its harshness, notably in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. However, it's crucial to note that a broad colonial empire like Germany's cannot be defined by such a singular description. The empire's policies and administration varied greatly across its diverse geography. Educational systems also differed significantly. After taking over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British found a well-educated African population. Similarly, contemporary authors praised German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies. Yet, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) starkly contrasted this. Unlike in East Africa, where the state played a key role in educating natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility largely fell to missionary societies with limited government support. The German government heavily invested in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted educated African populations, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to explore these factors, especially new research on settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes towards native Africans.\n\nMany sources discuss education in the German colonial empire, most in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works mainly described educational systems, while later English works expanded on these discussions through comparisons and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems across colonies. Notably, Cohen's study compared educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, attributing differences to South West Africa's large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was generally more temperate than other German colonies, with much of the territory being desert. The European population reflected this, with nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The landscape of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the past century, leading to a vast array of genres, with each having numerous sub and sub-sub genres. For instance, rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have all given birth to various sub-genres. Within this expansive canvas, Heavy Metal rock has stood out, becoming one of the most expressive and diverse genres in the past four decades. Its diversity stems from its early realization of flexibility, inspiring the creation of numerous sub-genres that continue to multiply today.\n\nToday, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that defining what 'heavy metal' truly is can be challenging. It has absorbed themes from various other genres, yet its roots remain in a movement characterized by darkness. Metal is often described as a 'music of more'—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Musicians in this genre are highly skilled, showcasing their instrumental prowess in their music. Additionally, the genre has a strong connection to drug culture, notably driven by the psychedelic boom of the mid-70s. This movement reflects many dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively new to popular music at the time. Later generations of metal bands have also drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Lyrics, like the ones from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, exemplify this darkness:\n\n\"Helter Skelter,\" a song by The Beatles, exhibits the genre's darker side, portraying the ups and downs supposedly inspired by drug use. This track is considered one of the first heavy metal songs, responding to a heavier, darker song by The Rolling Stones. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to create a similarly intense sound, which they achieved with \"Helter Skelter.\"",
            "Before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the Post-Impressionist artist, showcases not just a woman in awe of a dream landscape, but also Rousseau’s personal dreams and goals as a painter. He yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art world he admired, but faced an internal dilemma: conform to mimic established styles to gain acceptance, or remain creatively independent and unique. The Dream is the painting that best embodies this lifelong struggle in Rousseau’s career.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, one must first know Rousseau's story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was a tinsmith's son who grew up without formal art training. He worked as a gabelou until his forties and pursued painting as a source of comfort after the deaths of his wife and infant children. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average working class.\n\nRousseau’s ambition to gain acceptance from the art world is understandable given his context: he was untrained, started late, and worked alongside renowned artists. It wasn’t until around the same time Matisse gained recognition that Rousseau began to receive proper acknowledgment. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse wanted to avoid clichés, Rousseau’s desire was to paint conventionally enough to be admitted to the Artiste Français.",
            "Time and again, notable thinkers have posited a deep tie between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I contend that at a core level, there's a reason for this. As John Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—/ That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to find ethics and aesthetics appealing without being taught them in these conventional ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are efforts to describe, not prescribe. Our examinations of morality and beauty are usually attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior. More to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these don't explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, one often hears a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more detailed explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully explained by describing their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way of saying something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Similarly, ethics possesses this transcendent quality. As Wittgenstein put it, “Ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / I suggest that it is this 'something,' this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most potent attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them. I believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both in a noumenal way, using a Kantian term. They affect us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in the art of literature. As McKean asserts, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany is a formidable nation, bound together by a distinct culture that spans from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic Sea shores of Kiel. This culture is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's heart, to the picturesque city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given this unique cultural tapestry, it's unsurprising that modern Germany is a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name with disputed origins among scholars and historians. Some believe it comes from the Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Others propose that \"Germanus\" was a term used by Julius Caesar to differentiate the Germanic tribes he had not conquered from the Gauls he had, a word he borrowed from the Gauls themselves (Tacitus, 98). Still others suggest the name might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the loud and noisy nature of the Germans. (O.E.D., 2010)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as \"aboriginal\" and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He noted that those who sought to emigrate would arrive by sea, and questioned why anyone would leave the comforts of Rome for the harsh climate and customs of Germania (Tacitus, 98).\n\nMeanwhile, the Romans would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and services, and sometimes led military campaigns but generally returned to their sprawling empire. As the Germanic tribes began appearing in the first century, they lived along the Roman Empire's borders, trading their land-based goods and military skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I gazed down at the bowl in front of me, my mind working like a machine, analyzing every detail with cold detachment. It was a scene from a book I'd once bought, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a gift from a painter I'd worked with. The book taught how to frame a complex image into something manageable, like a bowl of fruit on a plain plane. Yet, the sight before me was too much. I could see the influence of great artists - Picasso's blue period, Monet's love for greenery, the Italian Renaissance masters' color palettes. If I could ever claim artistic merit, this was my starting point, my first story, \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers wrapped around my pencil, muscles tensing and releasing as I made my first mark. Water swirled, clear and calm. I could see the shape emerge, but my hand hit the toilet handle again, and nothing happened. The offending package refused to budge, like a slug stuck to the bottom. Mop in hand, tie strangling my neck, I stared at the ugly mess. It took a bit more effort, a few more moments of reflection, and then I was ready, hand wrapped in toilet paper like an oven mitt, dipping into the bowl like a mother retrieving a turkey from the oven...",
            "Teenagers are perishing behind the wheel. A confluence of factors opens up this treacherous route in teen driving statistics. The National Institutes of Health highlight that a key issue is that the teen brain is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving. Lack of experience also plays a significant role. This inexperience increases the likelihood of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teenagers also fare poorly when accompanied by peers, a scenario that is common, according to the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center. Their study correlated the passenger's age with the frequency of traffic accidents. Various states have introduced provisional licenses to limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers, but these are merely bandaid solutions. The core problem is that, collectively, young drivers are statistically not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman posits that 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research suggests a common urge among teens under 19-20 to seek thrills, making it logical to delay driving until these tendencies subside. Continuing to grant licenses to young teens will likely lead to an escalating death toll as Baby-Boomers' children become eligible to drive in the coming years. Legislation to address this could involve schools offering driver’s education but not allowing anyone under 18 to operate a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full license, with a set number of training hours required, similar to current state requirements. A national law would uniformly protect teens across the nation. This approach is far from unprecedented.",
            "As I browsed through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I came across fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My study of these films generally involved describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Early trick films at the turn of the century are typically set-bound, framed within a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and use long and medium shots, adhering to the one shot equals one film rule. However, some films from the early twentieth century dared to break these guidelines by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style, rooted in theatre and vaudeville, means that characters in trick films generally move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never leaving the frame as the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in shots that are mostly long and occasionally medium, with close-ups never used. This stems from the theatre tradition, where the audience saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders. Actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent.\n\nThese early trick films typically follow the rule that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting most films to about a minute or less. This also restricts their dramatic or narrative use, often focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and switching acts with minimal story. However, keep in mind that one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes doesn't necessarily correspond to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" might consist of several joined together to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, observe The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. A closer look reveals the moment when the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and fervent advocate for Republicanism.

            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was quite disheartening. It's tough to pinpoint the exact reason, but the onset of winter in a New England campus likely contributed to the drop in bicycle and pedestrian commuters. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, when everyone is focused on completing schoolwork and processing grades, which might have caused the log submissions to fall off the radar. The month-long holiday break for students and faculty also means many don't need to commute, and classes resuming in late January could explain the low February submissions. Despite these factors, the February slump remains unexplained. It's possible that the project experienced a natural decline in initial excitement, which we tried to combat with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This blitz campaign did result in an increase in log submissions for March. Maintaining project momentum, especially considering the holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education, proved challenging. Another hurdle was the deep-rooted preference for driving, which prompted the need for incentives. We offered numerous prizes like gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, and even chain stores. However, we wondered if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have sparked greater participation. The value of these prizes remained steady throughout the project. If we had announced increased prize values over time, such as adding bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that aims to replicate the performance of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets. Unlike index funds, ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, offering more flexibility. They provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase just one share. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, they come with the downside of incurring commissions on trades, as with buying or selling stocks. ETFs also offer a wide variety of funds to choose from, but it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of its assets. Below are the top holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can normalize their current asset percentages to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion they are held in the ETF. Beta and return calculations are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, indicating a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top 10 holdings is also 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of just these top 10 stocks could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, statistical significance needs to be verified.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-Land, one of Edgar Allan Poe's own self-proclaimed better poems, features the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Poe was evidently familiar with European literature, as seen in his use of the term, which Virgil employed to describe an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world to the ancient Greeks. Beyond Virgil's usage, some scholars attribute Poe's familiarity with the term \"Thule\" to his interest in German authors, namely Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThis connection is significant as it highlights Poe's knowledge of Goethe's work, specifically his drama \"Faust,\" which was first published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after losing his wife and giving her a goblet as a gift, descends into heavy drinking and despair. He eventually decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the sea and walking off a cliff. The similarity between the King of Thule and the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is striking, suggesting a possible connection to Poe's own experiences with loss and alcohol.\n\nPoe utilizes \"Thule\" twice in his works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he mentions \"ultma Thule,\" while in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describing a dark, lonely landscape haunted by the memories of lost friends. This scene mirrors the despair and loneliness of the King of Thule from Goethe's poem, as if Poe stepped into Goethe's world. Goethe was indeed a notable author, and Poe would have been exposed to his work through the many reproductions that circulated after the original publications. Additionally, Poe's admiration for Tennyson would have further drawn him to Goethe's work.",
            "Could a customer injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager's malicious intent, given that he knew about the spill and failed to clean it for half an hour while eating dinner?\n\nA California judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages outright. To prove malice, Palmer must show Martin's actions were deliberately cruel and showed disregard for probable harm. She can argue that Martin should have known about the risk of slips because of previous incidents, but still chose to ignore it. While her argument that Martin was despicable is less convincing, it's still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take action.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, Rich Wayne reported the spill to Martin, who was on a dinner break and didn't have time to clean it up. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin, but he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before her accident, five similar incidents had occurred in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we’re considering filing a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual acts of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a)). Malice is defined as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was despicable and committed with willful disregard for others' safety. (id. § 3294(c)(1)). Courts consider conduct malicious if the defendant was aware of the probable danger of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid it. (Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979)).",
            "About four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. The class sparked heated debates over whether Islam is inherently hostile. This topic feels more pertinent today than ever. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the American media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an unusually tolerant stance. In 2001, it's hard to imagine a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim background, gaining traction.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography piqued my interest, yet it clashes with my understanding of his character. Traditional accounts portray Muhammad as a conqueror, forcing conversions upon tribes. His biography, however, depicts him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly accepting people's faith. This narrative seems to devalue Muhammad's actions and overshadow Jesus' miracles with similar tales.\n\nThe similarities between Jesus' and Muhammad's ministries are striking, particularly the miracle of multiplying mutton and milk. This style of writing suggests Muhammad needed no proof, merely living in truth and miracles. This approach dilutes Jesus' life and miracle, giving credit to Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography seem designed to validate 'witness' conversions, yet they often rely on third-party accounts, diminishing credibility. They portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man, yet historical records contradict this portrayal.\n\nThe thing that really bothers me is their attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure. If Muslims today knew the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power, it would shed light on this dichotomy.",
            "Every era after Jesus left behind his teachings and beliefs, and Christian thought evolved in a direction that strayed from its origins. Observing this historical trajectory, we notice a persistent drift away from the religion's roots. Today, the world displays a heightened awareness and an unprecedented progressive inclination. While traditionalists persist, they may not significantly impact the broader population. Among Christians, a growing historical consciousness will emerge, fueling a desire to differentiate the doctrines that have accumulated over time from Jesus' original intent. This movement, though slow, is inevitable: it will reverse the trend of Christian history, returning it to its origin. A wave will grow, stripping away layers of doctrine as if rewinding the clock, until only the essence of Jesus' message remains. This reversal will permeate the United States and Europe, encouraging mass adherence to a faith centered solely on Jesus' ideas, with the church leading the charge. However, as the theological clock reverses, the diversity among Christians will diminish, leading to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and divisive differences will fade, replaced by growing similarities. History is replete with such reversals. For instance, Christians were initially persecuted by the Roman Empire but later saw its transformation into a Christian state. Our nation transitioned from African-American slavery to equality. This upcoming reversal will unfold within the realm of Christianity, undoing past diversions to return to the source. This shift will be enabled, in part, by interpreting Jesus' teachings metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired after Jesus' life? If we delve deep into history, we find only Judaism, the theological cradle of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures lay at its core by the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was fragmented into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I firmly believe that \"The Jungle\" showcases the inherent greed and self-interest that lies within human nature. People tend to prioritize their own well-being and strive to improve their lives, often without regard for those less fortunate. The novel demonstrates this through various instances, with the most notable being the factory owners and managers. Their primary objective is to expand and boost their business empires, disregarding any obstacles or collateral damage. Upton Sinclair's description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" vividly illustrates the detrimental effects of their actions. They display no concern for the people or animals harmed by the pollution or the animal waste run-off from the extensive pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also showed no empathy towards their employees, who were mere means to their wealth. They would exploit any opportunity to maximize profits, as Sinclair put it, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subjected their workers to harsh working conditions and arbitrarily laid off employees without notice or compensation. During this period, workers had little to no legal protection, leaving them vulnerable to the whims of their employers who pushed for increased productivity in grueling environments.\n\nThe harsh living and working conditions in Packingtown were so severe that many people worked themselves to the point of exhaustion and death. There were no support systems or agencies to provide information or assistance to workers. Unions were often more exploitative than helpful, profiting from the very workers they were supposed to protect. The workers were essentially trapped in this system, leading to a slave-like existence, as Sinclair wrote, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various tactics to convey specific feelings or attitudes about significant subjects, and some methods are more impactful than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns that wouldn't typically be associated to evoke a certain atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he invests symbols with meaning and then uses them for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently employs this latter technique with colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald endows these colors with significance, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to remind readers of certain feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns white/gray the connotation of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and higher social class, and gray signifying something older and faded. He establishes this significance early in the novel with repeated references to these colors. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (page 8), and everyone at Gatsby’s party wears white: Nick wears “white flannels” (page 41), Tom wears a “white shirt” (page 36), and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (page 30). The only time people are not in white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: the “halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (page 40). Fitzgerald further emphasizes these colors by coloring many mundane subjects in them: Nick’s commute to work leads him “down the white chasms of lower New York” (page 56), the names of party guests are “gray names” (page 61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” — uniformity (page 28). He also describes ordinary people or places in these colors: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (page 19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (page 23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (page 26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (page 27).\n\nAfter imbuing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald uses them to represent unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. This technique to show readers something begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster.” Readers start to see Daisy as less of a character, more like a uniform addition that Gatsby yearns for (page 74). Fitzgerald employs this method consistently around Daisy to evoke the impression of her being an unimportant, uniform addition. For example, her fur collar is a “gray haze” (page 18), and she is again in a “white” (page 115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is an incredibly fertile region, thanks to its mild and sunny climate. Popular crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is robust in the area, with many local organizations facing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farm would allow the landowner to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat, offering recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs. Organic farming can also lead to greater biodiversity of both plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water, although it often comes with higher costs in terms of labor and management. Additionally, practices beneficial to wildlife can add to these costs, such as planting cover crops and managing invasive species. This could make the landowner seek financial assistance or expertise in maximizing both profit and habitat quality. The chosen land is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently includes over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. This area has been home to Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing or wood production for many years. I chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. As a model for farming this land, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by culture, which is more than just what it is, but also what it isn't. It's not uniform, not singular, and not limited to national borders. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the reality of cultural nuances. A negotiator should focus on how the cultural context impacts the negotiation, rather than making sweeping assumptions. When venturing into unfamiliar territory, it's natural to compare it to one's own cultural framework, but it's crucial to respect and understand the differences.\n\nGetting to know a culture can mean learning its history, understanding its prejudices, or simply appreciating its customs. Don't aim to change or judge a culture, but rather work within its parameters, especially when you're in a weaker bargaining position. Being in \"away\" territory means embracing the traditions and beliefs that could be barriers, and using them to move the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences; it's also about corporate cultures within a nation. Some companies promote long work hours, others emphasize a relaxed schedule. Indicators of corporate culture can be found in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same nation, corporate cultures vary greatly. For instance, American corporate culture differs vastly from one company to another, and even within a company, there can be regional differences.\n\nValues are key to understanding a culture as they provide the 'why' behind cultural behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator must be sensitive to not disrespect those values. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values hard negotiation tactics may not be eager to settle early. Knowing these generalities before the negotiation begins is important, but also consider your opponent's personal traits to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This infamous phrase is found at the outset of Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and also serves as the launching point for St. Anselm’s argument on the existence of God, a stance seemingly shared by Thomas Aquinas. To compare their arguments effectively, we’ll start by accepting their shared belief in the Bible’s God. However, neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nLet’s first break down Anselm’s core argument. He posits that the proof for God's existence lies within our own minds, as God is within our understanding. While his explanation can be convoluted, it essentially boils down to trusting our inherent knowledge of God's existence. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts, as it does not rely on empirical evidence.\n\nContrarily, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God’s existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence with no need for faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of new converts without requiring belief in something unprovable. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support this, each demonstrating the necessity of God's existence in the world. For instance, if you have a puzzle missing a piece, you can infer the existence and features of that piece through logic alone.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later become known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he disavowed the world, attained enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional branch. Now over two and a half millennia old, the religion has evolved extensively. You can see this change in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate, but Buddha himself never taught about such an event. These modifications extend from simple traditions to the very core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both in its monastic and lay forms, has had to adapt its teachings over time, influenced by a mix of external and internal pressures, both positive and negative.\n\nThere are several key terms we'll use throughout this discussion. Internal forces refer to those originating from members of the Buddha's teachings, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are any influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that don't necessarily aim to help or harm the community but may do so as a side effect. We'll use these terms frequently as we proceed.\n\nFirst, let's delve into the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, the three baskets, of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by acknowledging these concepts can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With this escape comes the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets rules for life, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (I will not kill, lie, steal, misbehave sexually, or take intoxicants) and monks following many more rules. The most fundamental teaching in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States conquered Mexico and seized Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Various conflicts and skirmishes between the two nations continued until just before World War I. The rivalry began due to differing views on key issues like religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis tense relationship is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Border-sharing nations often find themselves in rivalries due to overlapping interests and disputes (David M. Pletcher 1977 p. 41). Unlike other Latin American nations, Mexico and Cuba have a long history of rivalry with the United States. Religious differences also played a significant role in their strained relationship. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, much like the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was a mix of ideological struggle and competition for strategic interests. This distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial past, posed a significant obstacle to friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from raids by bandits and outlaws from border towns. This persisted until both nations began exerting military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The rivalry started to diminish as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States. It ended as American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness I was unaware of. I was a nurse at the time, drawn to the profession for the safety and security it offered, a stark contrast to my upbringing. \"You'll always have a job; people will always need care,\" was the mantra that guided me through adolescence and beyond. My dream was to be a scientist or journalist, but nursing seemed the practical choice.\n\nYet here I was: 46 years old, single, and unable to work due to disability. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and despite my efforts, I have little remaining that is truly mine. My life is a constant struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few kind friends.\n\nMy point is that life throws emergencies at us, big and small. No amount of preparation can guard against everything. I agree that we should not rely solely on big government, but I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, rather than each person trying to survive alone.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk of rugged individualism, but history tells us it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that kept our forefathers going through hard times. The pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone in wagon trains.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and more. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Ever wondered why organisms evolve the way they do? Are there specific restraints or limitations that shape the path of evolutionary change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson noted that even today, zoologists have barely scratched the surface in describing organic forms mathematically. Modern mathematical modeling has been applied to mollusk skeletogenesis through both growth and evolutionary history, as seen in studies like Raup and Stanley's work in 1981. Our research explores how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, in tandem with experimental studies, can shed light on the processes driving the direction and extent of these changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that help model hypothetical and real shell morphologies using the CerioShell software. These models help interpret the possible limits of morphological change in Prunum, combining with experimental and descriptive studies to understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be seen as a tube that wraps around over time through 360 degrees of space, with each complete turn called a whorl. These whorls spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The speed and size of whorls can vary, with each whorl separated by a continuous line known as a suture. The largest whorl, the body whorl, is typically the last one. The spire is the part of the shell excluding the body whorl, with the apex at the tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and find the start of the first suture. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal grows its shell. This movement can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius. Mathematically representing this trajectory allows for parameter adjustments and modifications to the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Every year, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia stays roughly the same, despite notable progress in other areas such as water and sanitation. The country is lagging behind in improving child and maternal health, which threatens to miss its 2015 targets. To understand these issues, a closer look at the health system is needed, rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen a rise in births attended by skilled health workers, now at 72%. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who can't provide medical interventions in case of complications. Moreover, there's been a drop in the number of children under five treated for diarrhea by a health professional, and postnatal care remains a significant concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, around 4%, with urban areas at 7% and rural at a mere 2%. This disparity indicates inequitable access to healthcare services, with urban areas receiving more attention. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, highlighting the financial barriers to care for the less privileged.\n\nAs we move forward, the core question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches, or strengthen the overall health system, including pre and post-pregnancy care? Programmatic approaches offer clear objectives and swift results, but they can also lead to funding and resource imbalances, and uncoordinated, duplicated services.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their concentration on the upper class of the era. Two novels, however, are exceptions to this norm: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and the peculiar, deviating from the period's typical fare. This unique approach enhances the characters, offering deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist grapples with the strange events unfolding around him, he is haunted by vivid, dreamlike visions. In one such sequence, he finds himself conversing with Sikes and Crackit, who are in a heated argument. Suddenly, gunshots ring out, and Oliver is thrust into chaos, his senses overwhelmed. Throughout this turmoil, he is plagued by a persistent, undefined pain. This shooting experience leaves Oliver feeling powerless and defeated, unable to control his fate. The fact that he cannot muster the will to save himself, even in the face of imminent danger, suggests that Fagin’s influence has broken him, leaving him to accept this despair. The lack of control Oliver feels is emphasized by his inability to influence the outcome of the shooting, despite his life being at stake.",
            "A few years back, I was working in an after-school program, assisting elementary students with their schoolwork, and my forte was English and reading. It wasn't long before I was recruited to help a young boy named Adrian, a third or fourth grader, who was having trouble reading. The more I worked with him, the more peculiar his reading difficulties became. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others were off by a mile. Despite being of Latino descent and speaking perfect English, Adrian's struggles with reading were puzzling. It wasn't until I met his mother that it all clicked – Adrian could read, he just hadn't mastered the English alphabet. While I'm not sure if my intervention helped him much, I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of the language barrier, especially in California schools. It's not always as clear-cut as we think. A child speaking perfect English can still struggle with reading. Everyone agrees this is an issue, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple – English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for children with limited English skills, it's much more complex. There's no magic answer. Combining dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is key.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is brilliant. It's not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" While there's fear surrounding this approach, that it's a waste of resources and won't benefit the majority, these fears are unfounded. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. So, how do we achieve this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. However, having bilingual aids or tutors in classrooms makes sense.",
            "From childhood, we're often told there's something greater than ourselves, a force beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school, temple, or look within for answers. Many of us embrace the religions our parents instilled in us, while others reject them, claiming there's nothing beyond our personal universe. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds. Regardless of our journey, we strive to define ourselves through our unique perspectives of spirituality, searching for a light in the darkness to guide us to the sun.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain drumming on the tin roof, and smoked our cigarettes together. Gutters carried the rain, drowning plants along the edge. He gazed into the falling rain, his eyes searching, remembering. His body had grown frail from months of illness, and his hair was thinner than I recalled. He didn't make eye contact, and I felt alone, afraid, unable to talk about how much I'd miss him. I hugged him, then sat closer, and together we watched the June twilight's rain.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation had only extended his suffering; I couldn't comprehend the purpose of it. A God that would do this was silent to me.

            "The classic Gothic Novel is, in essence and name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" according to Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has faced both criticism and praise, with some labeling it shallow and others marveling at its 'terrible sublime' allure (Burke). The founding text, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended old theatrical elements and new novelistic techniques to give birth to the proto-Gothic genre. Walpole's \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4) uses medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, drawing upon the archaic or unsophisticated connotations of the term \"gothic\" in the face of modern societal advancements. The fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's personal perspective on character psychology is what has kept Gothic literature alive, both antiquated and fresh, for centuries.\n\nOne central theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers as it represents the ideals of bravery, honor, and competence. Walpole, writing during politically tumultuous times, may have felt that the moral goodness of the Gothic era had faded in contemporary society, inspiring him to idealize and romanticize the 'gothic past' through his writing. Characters like Frederic embody this chivalric spirit, described as a prince, a victim of tragedy, and slain by infidels. Frederic's character is exaggerated, embodying the soon-to-be iconic Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the set of processes that move goods from the customer's order to the stage of raw materials, through production, and distribution to the customer. The concept was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982. He described it as the planning, implementation, and control of activities along the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and effectively. Key elements include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these elements to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nThe first step in this process is production. This is the backbone of the entire supply chain. Production involves deciding when, why, where, and how everything will be made. Managers need to understand customer preferences, which they can gauge through market analysis. By examining the market, they can determine customer demands and decide what products to produce and in what quantities. They also determine the optimal location for production, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. After setting the production location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial, and each detail must be meticulously planned to avoid long-term costs. For instance, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, both of which have detailed processes for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. These outlined processes ensure smooth operation and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply. It involves making strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and determining which outsourcing partnerships to pursue. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the best division for each process. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to increase velocity. Velocity refers to providing high-quality, flexible service while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Every day, I see a sign in Burma that declares \"Hitler is alive here.\" Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a cardboard sign, scrawled with the message in black Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country governed by a brutal military junta. In 2007, protests led by Buddhist monks, known as the Saffron Revolution, erupted in the streets. At first, the government permitted monks to gather peacefully, but later, violence escalated, leading to the military's invasion of monasteries and the imprisonment of foreign journalists. The official death toll stands at 13, but a former soldier, Colonel Hla Win, claims many more died.\n\nThis is not a new occurrence. Throughout history, leaders have suppressed dissent to maintain control. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered gods, and our current president, George W. Bush, is rumored to have weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a party affiliate.\n\nNotable examples of such atrocities include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest authoritarian rule, with the death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. And, of course, Hitler's Third Reich saw the systematic persecution and murder of Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington’s enduring influence on jazz can be attributed to his longevity and his unmatched ability to mold his orchestra into a versatile ensemble. His piano playing, while often subtle, serves as the foundation for many of his compositions, which beautifully highlight the individual talents of his band members. As a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that allowed for solo improvisation, while also writing highly orchestrated sections that showcased each musician’s unique style. By doing so, he created cohesive and distinct sounds that brought each piece to life. Ellington’s masterful understanding of his players’ sounds and how they blended together in a growing ensemble resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant recordings in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s innovative use of voice as an instrument throughout his career. His piece Creole Love Call is a notable early example of this, where he used voice to add depth and color without the distraction of lyrics. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each showcasing a different soloist and call and response technique. These choruses illustrate Ellington’s ability to complement the style of his soloists, a skill that permeates his entire career.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his talent for tight orchestration with his keen ear for tone color. He achieves this by using “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet call and response with Baby Cox’s scat singing. The interplay between Miley’s vocal elements and Cox’s instrumental voice creates a rich, complementary sound. Ellington’s masterful use of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further demonstrates this ability.\n\nEllington’s innovative use of voice to add tone color to his pieces is a recurring stylistic trait that sets his work apart.",
            "She'd always felt a strange emptiness, a yearning for something she couldn't quite put her finger on. It began when she was 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted despite the passage of three years. At 17, she decided she wanted a relationship, but no one seemed to ignite her interest. She pondered this peculiar situation endlessly, but her contemplation yielded no satisfying answers.

            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet score, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower risk of stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious research has shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also discovered that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without prior CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to assess nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses remained throughout the entire study period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounding factors (which could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe study found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile were at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States endured a devastating financial calamity. The unemployment rate soared, the housing market imploded, and many of America's most influential businesses were left in shambles. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting us to examine how it came to pass and how we might prevent a recurrence. Simply put, the crisis was cultivated by shortsighted political decisions that compelled banks and corporations to disburse sub-prime loans to an already perilous financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDO's and CDS's. When borrowers defaulted, banks were left with depleted capital reserves and passed the resulting chaos on to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in 1999 during the Clinton administration. President Clinton, seeking a second term, eased lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move ultimately prepared the ground for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times observed in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, has been increasingly pressured by the Clinton Administration to expand loans to low and moderate-income individuals and has faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As elaborated upon, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would inevitably result in the economy's collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic freefall, one of which was the innovative mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) were extensively utilized in the years preceding the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This overleveraging left both U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which constituted about 30% of the USA's GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold off at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to operate as commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your tale where you attempt to take flight, captivating your audience with your spellbinding words, or the section where your readers nod off and hit the \"Back\" button, muttering your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of it, feeling like she's been trapped in a never-ending monologue.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the fundamental writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into stretches of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder whispering, \"Get the boring parts out of the way to reach the good stuff\" (not to be confused with the other devil on your shoulder, urging you to tell your audience every detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition means sharing the details of what happened in simple prose. In movies, exposition occurs when one character dumps information onto another, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific place and time, that they married in a grand style, and that her husband was killed in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with both of them speaking only a few lines. You'd expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. You'd also expect the heroine to reveal her feelings for him in subtle ways, reflecting how his presence in her life has changed and enriched her (especially if the story later reveals this explicitly). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and the heroine's character: you'd learn what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect substance behind the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add that meat. (*looks at the metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, now he's the night manager of a gas station, he's been married twice, has no kids, likes to fish on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live NBC 4 report from this morning (August 13, 2011), featured a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. His mugshot showed a face that seemed to epitomize evil, and he received a mere two minutes of coverage. The story was relatively brief, but I thought the time given was appropriate.\nThe second story concerned the shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old man in the Sharon Woods area. He had been critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was conducting an investigation. This story seemed brief, which I believe was due to the victim being a minority. I've noticed this tendency for years; if a white person is a crime victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, it barely gets a mention.\nThe third story was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators believe it was caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\nThe fourth story was about Saturday's predicted rain and thunderstorms. They mentioned the weekend's mid to low 80°F temperatures, but the report was quite short, serving as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\nAnother story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. The amount of time the reporter spent emphasizing his race seemed unusual.\nLastly, they reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas.

In this bond, emotions dance and clash, a symphony of love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, all bound together in an unspoken understanding. Brothers see in each other a reflection of themselves, a truth that is harder to accept than any other. It is in the darkest moments, when the storms of emotion rage, that this bond reveals its true power. The price of understanding the emotions that flow from this fraternal bond is high, for it demands we confront the consequences that come with them. Seeing the truth in another's eyes, we see ourselves not as others see us, but as we truly are. Our actions and their consequences bare our character for all to see. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme, and the complex emotions it brings. Through a landscape vividly described, these boys embark on a journey that leads to a dramatic conclusion. The protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together, to their final, tragic encounter, he feels resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother he could teach and bond with, someone to share his adventures with, but Doodle's frail heart made that impossible. His dreams were shattered, and he even contemplated harming his brother. Yet, when Doodle smiled at him, his heart softened. This emotional rollercoaster shows that, despite his intentions, he had an innate love for his brother. The narrator's perspective also highlights the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, both of which greatly influence his actions.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing apparatus. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll of papyrus, next to a book, and most recently to a computer. When exploring brain science, remember that these metaphors only go so far and can lead to false conclusions. Information's journey begins with the sensory organs, converting physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and object borders to identify it as a box. Top-down processing aids in this recognition, helping you recognize it as a black box rather than a hole. Once processed, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and its access to cognitive processes. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter keeps you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you notice your name spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, each modulated by attention. To process information, it must first be stored in different types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded in specific ways for each sensory stimulus; verbal input, for example, can be encoded by its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest working memory, which holds information briefly, is maintained by a looping electrical signal in specific neurons. Long-term memory information is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins. There are various models of knowledge organization in the brain, ranging from human memory retrieval to computer science to neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stance against the impending dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. The story unfolds in a dystopian future where people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to chase immediate happiness. The citizens, in reality, are mere pawns in a grand scheme controlled by the World Controller. Marxist ideology shines through in this critique, as the author expresses concerns about the development of these systems. Key Marxist concepts like homogenization and reification highlight the faults of the emerging capitalist economy from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is skewered through the lens of false consciousness, a Marxist idea where the common people are kept unaware of true economic relations. This is evident in Brave New World where people are more interested in personal gain than understanding their place in the economic system. The conditioning through hypnopædia drives the populace to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony is clear here, with the lower classes dominated by the ruling class, unaware of their manipulation. The upper classes, like Alphas or Betas, accept their role, with few characters like Bernard questioning their place. The superficial interactions and lack of depth among characters suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism segregates individuals, stripping them of free will and expression. Love and deep emotions are absent, with interactions reduced to discussions about physical appearances. This reflects the societal complacency and obedience to the capitalist hierarchy. In essence, Brave New World uses capitalism's socioeconomic effects to showcase the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who believe they are superior as long as they consume, obey, and blend in with their peers.",
            "I've been a University Park student for nearly three years, which equates to a little over four semesters. Navigating the campus can be a real challenge for many, including myself. My first year, I was placed in an East Halls dorm room, as far east as you can get without counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes like those in the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially on bad weather days, which are frequent in State College. An alum, not much older than myself, shared that not long ago, East Halls were separated from the rest of the school by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and the surrounding apartments. As our campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. The solution? Bicycles. But bikes alone won’t solve the problem; they must be used, and the campus must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who started cycling again after a long break. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a few years, it wasn’t cool to ride one, but it’s the only way to get around.\" Apart from being great for your body, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, equally distant from the center of campus as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I attend class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes. The only snag is Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, which isn’t always the easiest to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its advantages, I’m too busy to do it. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option for class. Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, which totals over two and a half hours each week. I’d have even more time to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, which is time I can’t afford to spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I aim to work in the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping abused or neglected children, and supporting troubled families. The values I bring to the field include service, respect, ethical practice, commitment to strengthening relationships, and a dedication to professional growth to remain skilled. These are not just professional values; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nGrowing up, I've always desired to assist others, but I was uncertain about my career path. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people retreat from their problems in denial and some used coping strategies that weren't ideal. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still undecided about my career, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. To assist, I drove to his parents’ house, where I privately shared my concerns with the police. They asked me to speak with the parents, as they were powerless to intervene. When I questioned the parents about their son’s behavior, they seemed defensive and blamed him for involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes. This experience sparked my interest in social work to help children with family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. Society claims to value individuals but often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual and reject limiting myself to fit into others' molds. Throughout high school and college, I protested social injustice: I colored my hair unnatural colors, wore expressive clothing, pierced my ears beyond the norm, joined the GSBA, and fought against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "This document explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic factors and medical aspects that influence sleep disorders. On the other hand, the Sociocultural model investigates the environmental influences that relate to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review that follows examines these models and presents research that pertains to and elucidates them. The research findings are then critically evaluated to highlight their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia, a sleep disorder, can be categorized as either a primary sleep disorder, one related to another mental disorder, or one stemming from medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders fall under Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Other categories encompass sleep disorders due to medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias, which include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), pertain to issues with initiating or maintaining sleep. Primary Insomnia, for instance, is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia refers to difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve sleep disorders linked to behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, inherited factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence of this receptor could alter one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The Sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, it could regulate sleep. An alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual, negatively impacting aspects of life such as school, career, and everyday tasks that require focus.",
            "This document delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the condition. It then outlines the diagnostic process, highlighting common symptoms, or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it concludes with strategies for teachers working in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Simply put, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly process sounds, distinguishing words from background noise, despite normal hearing. Individuals with CAPD can hear perfectly but face difficulties in the brain's processing of what they hear.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954. Kimura introduced dichotic testing and explained the physiological basis of the central nervous system's role in dichotic perception in 1961. A 1977 national conference further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents in various forms, including difficulty in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and synthesizing sound clues meaningfully. It can also manifest as a struggle to determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists use various measures to assess auditory-related skills. There is no single, consistently reliable test, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown. Tests typically present multiple auditory stimuli and ask for differentiation. Advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night teaches that while disguise can be a powerful tool to maintain deception for extended periods, it ultimately requires the wearer to shed that false persona to prevent losing one's true self. The challenge lies in ending the charade, as it may lead to feelings of alienation. One must then choose between preserving self-identity or maintaining relationships. Some may accept the deception without issue, but others might be offended. The theme of gender role reversal in deception is complex, raising questions like why someone might feel the need to assume an opposite-gender guise. In Viola’s case, it's a form of self-defense: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola masquerades as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. Her scheme works, but it isolates her from the female community, and she finds herself in a romantic turmoil with Olivia and Orsino: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) While this could be seen as progressive, to a modern reader, Twelfth Night might demonstrate how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Unshed feelings may be forced to the surface due to Viola/Cesario's presence. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because she thinks he's a man, or does she secretly harbor affection for women? It seems unlikely, as Olivia's character seems to mock those who judge others solely on appearance. This is evident in her quick shift from Cesario to Sebastian, and her familial acceptance of Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has long been criticized for its harshness, notably in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. However, it's crucial to note that a broad colonial empire like Germany's cannot be defined by such a singular description. The empire's policies and administration varied greatly across its diverse geography. Educational systems also differed significantly. After taking over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British found a well-educated African population. Similarly, contemporary authors praised German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies. Yet, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) starkly contrasted this. Unlike in East Africa, where the state played a key role in educating natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility largely fell to missionary societies with limited government support. The German government heavily invested in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted educated African populations, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to explore these factors, especially new research on settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes towards native Africans.\n\nMany sources discuss education in the German colonial empire, most in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works mainly described educational systems, while later English works expanded on these discussions through comparisons and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems across colonies. Notably, Cohen's study compared educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, attributing differences to South West Africa's large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was generally more temperate than other German colonies, with much of the territory being desert. The European population reflected this, with nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The landscape of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the past century, leading to a vast array of genres, with each having numerous sub and sub-sub genres. For instance, rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have all given birth to various sub-genres. Within this expansive canvas, Heavy Metal rock has stood out, becoming one of the most expressive and diverse genres in the past four decades. Its diversity stems from its early realization of flexibility, inspiring the creation of numerous sub-genres that continue to multiply today.\n\nToday, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that defining what 'heavy metal' truly is can be challenging. It has absorbed themes from various other genres, yet its roots remain in a movement characterized by darkness. Metal is often described as a 'music of more'—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Musicians in this genre are highly skilled, showcasing their instrumental prowess in their music. Additionally, the genre has a strong connection to drug culture, notably driven by the psychedelic boom of the mid-70s. This movement reflects many dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively new to popular music at the time. Later generations of metal bands have also drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Lyrics, like the ones from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, exemplify this darkness:\n\n\"Helter Skelter,\" a song by The Beatles, exhibits the genre's darker side, portraying the ups and downs supposedly inspired by drug use. This track is considered one of the first heavy metal songs, responding to a heavier, darker song by The Rolling Stones. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to create a similarly intense sound, which they achieved with \"Helter Skelter.\"",
            "Before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the Post-Impressionist artist, showcases not just a woman in awe of a dream landscape, but also Rousseau’s personal dreams and goals as a painter. He yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art world he admired, but faced an internal dilemma: conform to mimic established styles to gain acceptance, or remain creatively independent and unique. The Dream is the painting that best embodies this lifelong struggle in Rousseau’s career.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, one must first know Rousseau's story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was a tinsmith's son who grew up without formal art training. He worked as a gabelou until his forties and pursued painting as a source of comfort after the deaths of his wife and infant children. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average working class.\n\nRousseau’s ambition to gain acceptance from the art world is understandable given his context: he was untrained, started late, and worked alongside renowned artists. It wasn’t until around the same time Matisse gained recognition that Rousseau began to receive proper acknowledgment. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse wanted to avoid clichés, Rousseau’s desire was to paint conventionally enough to be admitted to the Artiste Français.",
            "Time and again, notable thinkers have posited a deep tie between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I contend that at a core level, there's a reason for this. As John Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—/ That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to find ethics and aesthetics appealing without being taught them in these conventional ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are efforts to describe, not prescribe. Our examinations of morality and beauty are usually attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior. More to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these don't explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, one often hears a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more detailed explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully explained by describing their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way of saying something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Similarly, ethics possesses this transcendent quality. As Wittgenstein put it, “Ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / I suggest that it is this 'something,' this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most potent attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them. I believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both in a noumenal way, using a Kantian term. They affect us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in the art of literature. As McKean asserts, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany is a formidable nation, bound together by a distinct culture that spans from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic Sea shores of Kiel. This culture is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's heart, to the picturesque city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given this unique cultural tapestry, it's unsurprising that modern Germany is a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name with disputed origins among scholars and historians. Some believe it comes from the Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Others propose that \"Germanus\" was a term used by Julius Caesar to differentiate the Germanic tribes he had not conquered from the Gauls he had, a word he borrowed from the Gauls themselves (Tacitus, 98). Still others suggest the name might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the loud and noisy nature of the Germans. (O.E.D., 2010)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as \"aboriginal\" and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He noted that those who sought to emigrate would arrive by sea, and questioned why anyone would leave the comforts of Rome for the harsh climate and customs of Germania (Tacitus, 98).\n\nMeanwhile, the Romans would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and services, and sometimes led military campaigns but generally returned to their sprawling empire. As the Germanic tribes began appearing in the first century, they lived along the Roman Empire's borders, trading their land-based goods and military skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I gazed down at the bowl in front of me, my mind working like a machine, analyzing every detail with cold detachment. It was a scene from a book I'd once bought, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a gift from a painter I'd worked with. The book taught how to frame a complex image into something manageable, like a bowl of fruit on a plain plane. Yet, the sight before me was too much. I could see the influence of great artists - Picasso's blue period, Monet's love for greenery, the Italian Renaissance masters' color palettes. If I could ever claim artistic merit, this was my starting point, my first story, \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers wrapped around my pencil, muscles tensing and releasing as I made my first mark. Water swirled, clear and calm. I could see the shape emerge, but my hand hit the toilet handle again, and nothing happened. The offending package refused to budge, like a slug stuck to the bottom. Mop in hand, tie strangling my neck, I stared at the ugly mess.

            "Teenagers are perishing behind the wheel. A confluence of factors opens up this treacherous route in teen driving statistics. The National Institutes of Health highlight that a key issue is that the teen brain is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving. Lack of experience also plays a significant role. This inexperience increases the likelihood of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teenagers also fare poorly when accompanied by peers, a scenario that is common, according to the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center. Their study correlated the passenger's age with the frequency of traffic accidents. Various states have introduced provisional licenses to limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers, but these are merely bandaid solutions. The core problem is that, collectively, young drivers are statistically not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman posits that 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research suggests a common urge among teens under 19-20 to seek thrills, making it logical to delay driving until these tendencies subside. Continuing to grant licenses to young teens will likely lead to an escalating death toll as Baby-Boomers' children become eligible to drive in the coming years. Legislation to address this could involve schools offering driver’s education but not allowing anyone under 18 to operate a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full license, with a set number of training hours required, similar to current state requirements. A national law would uniformly protect teens across the nation. This approach is far from unprecedented.",
            "As I browsed through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I came across fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My study of these films generally involved describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Early trick films at the turn of the century are typically set-bound, framed within a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and use long and medium shots, adhering to the one shot equals one film rule. However, some films from the early twentieth century dared to break these guidelines by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style, rooted in theatre and vaudeville, means that characters in trick films generally move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never leaving the frame as the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in shots that are mostly long and occasionally medium, with close-ups never used. This stems from the theatre tradition, where the audience saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders. Actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent.\n\nThese early trick films typically follow the rule that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting most films to about a minute or less. This also restricts their dramatic or narrative use, often focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and switching acts with minimal story. However, keep in mind that one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes doesn't necessarily correspond to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" might consist of several joined together to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, observe The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. A closer look reveals the moment when the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",

            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was quite disheartening. It's tough to pinpoint the exact reason, but the onset of winter in a New England campus likely contributed to the drop in bicycle and pedestrian commuters. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, when everyone is focused on completing schoolwork and processing grades, which might have caused the log submissions to fall off the radar. The month-long holiday break for students and faculty also means many don't need to commute, and classes resuming in late January could explain the low February submissions. Despite these factors, the February slump remains unexplained. It's possible that the project experienced a natural decline in initial excitement, which we tried to combat with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This blitz campaign did result in an increase in log submissions for March. Maintaining project momentum, especially considering the holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education, proved challenging. Another hurdle was the deep-rooted preference for driving, which prompted the need for incentives. We offered numerous prizes like gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, and even chain stores. However, we wondered if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have sparked greater participation. The value of these prizes remained steady throughout the project. If we had announced increased prize values over time, such as adding bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that aims to replicate the performance of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets. Unlike index funds, ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, offering more flexibility. They provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase just one share. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, they come with the downside of incurring commissions on trades, as with buying or selling stocks. ETFs also offer a wide variety of funds to choose from, but it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of its assets. Below are the top holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can normalize their current asset percentages to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion they are held in the ETF. Beta and return calculations are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, indicating a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top 10 holdings is also 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of just these top 10 stocks could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, statistical significance needs to be verified.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-Land, one of Edgar Allan Poe's own self-proclaimed better poems, features the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Poe was evidently familiar with European literature, as seen in his use of the term, which Virgil employed to describe an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world to the ancient Greeks. Beyond Virgil's usage, some scholars attribute Poe's familiarity with the term \"Thule\" to his interest in German authors, namely Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThis connection is significant as it highlights Poe's knowledge of Goethe's work, specifically his drama \"Faust,\" which was first published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after losing his wife and giving her a goblet as a gift, descends into heavy drinking and despair. He eventually decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the sea and walking off a cliff. The similarity between the King of Thule and the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is striking, suggesting a possible connection to Poe's own experiences with loss and alcohol.\n\nPoe utilizes \"Thule\" twice in his works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he mentions \"ultma Thule,\" while in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describing a dark, lonely landscape haunted by the memories of lost friends. This scene mirrors the despair and loneliness of the King of Thule from Goethe's poem, as if Poe stepped into Goethe's world. Goethe was indeed a notable author, and Poe would have been exposed to his work through the many reproductions that circulated after the original publications. Additionally, Poe's admiration for Tennyson would have further drawn him to Goethe's work.",
            "Could a customer injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager's malicious intent, given that he knew about the spill and failed to clean it for half an hour while eating dinner?\n\nA California judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages outright. To prove malice, Palmer must show Martin's actions were deliberately cruel and showed disregard for probable harm. She can argue that Martin should have known about the risk of slips because of previous incidents, but still chose to ignore it. While her argument that Martin was despicable is less convincing, it's still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take action.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, Rich Wayne reported the spill to Martin, who was on a dinner break and didn't have time to clean it up. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin, but he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before her accident, five similar incidents had occurred in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we’re considering filing a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual acts of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a)). Malice is defined as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was despicable and committed with willful disregard for others' safety. (id. § 3294(c)(1)). Courts consider conduct malicious if the defendant was aware of the probable danger of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid it. (Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979)).",
            "About four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. The class sparked heated debates over whether Islam is inherently hostile. This topic feels more pertinent today than ever. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the American media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an unusually tolerant stance. In 2001, it's hard to imagine a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim background, gaining traction.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography piqued my interest, yet it clashes with my understanding of his character. Traditional accounts portray Muhammad as a conqueror, forcing conversions upon tribes. His biography, however, depicts him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly accepting people's faith. This narrative seems to devalue Muhammad's actions and overshadow Jesus' miracles with similar tales.\n\nThe similarities between Jesus' and Muhammad's ministries are striking, particularly the miracle of multiplying mutton and milk. This style of writing suggests Muhammad needed no proof, merely living in truth and miracles. This approach dilutes Jesus' life and miracle, giving credit to Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography seem designed to validate 'witness' conversions, yet they often rely on third-party accounts, diminishing credibility. They portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man, yet historical records contradict this portrayal.\n\nThe thing that really bothers me is their attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure. If Muslims today knew the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power, it would shed light on this dichotomy.",
            "Every era after Jesus left behind his teachings and beliefs, and Christian thought evolved in a direction that strayed from its origins. Observing this historical trajectory, we notice a persistent drift away from the religion's roots. Today, the world displays a heightened awareness and an unprecedented progressive inclination. While traditionalists persist, they may not significantly impact the broader population. Among Christians, a growing historical consciousness will emerge, fueling a desire to differentiate the doctrines that have accumulated over time from Jesus' original intent. This movement, though slow, is inevitable: it will reverse the trend of Christian history, returning it to its origin. A wave will grow, stripping away layers of doctrine as if rewinding the clock, until only the essence of Jesus' message remains. This reversal will permeate the United States and Europe, encouraging mass adherence to a faith centered solely on Jesus' ideas, with the church leading the charge. However, as the theological clock reverses, the diversity among Christians will diminish, leading to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and divisive differences will fade, replaced by growing similarities. History is replete with such reversals. For instance, Christians were initially persecuted by the Roman Empire but later saw its transformation into a Christian state. Our nation transitioned from African-American slavery to equality. This upcoming reversal will unfold within the realm of Christianity, undoing past diversions to return to the source. This shift will be enabled, in part, by interpreting Jesus' teachings metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired after Jesus' life? If we delve deep into history, we find only Judaism, the theological cradle of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures lay at its core by the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was fragmented into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I firmly believe that \"The Jungle\" showcases the inherent greed and self-interest that lies within human nature. People tend to prioritize their own well-being and strive to improve their lives, often without regard for those less fortunate. The novel demonstrates this through various instances, with the most notable being the factory owners and managers. Their primary objective is to expand and boost their business empires, disregarding any obstacles or collateral damage. Upton Sinclair's description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" vividly illustrates the detrimental effects of their actions. They display no concern for the people or animals harmed by the pollution or the animal waste run-off from the extensive pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also showed no empathy towards their employees, who were mere means to their wealth. They would exploit any opportunity to maximize profits, as Sinclair put it, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subjected their workers to harsh working conditions and arbitrarily laid off employees without notice or compensation. During this period, workers had little to no legal protection, leaving them vulnerable to the whims of their employers who pushed for increased productivity in grueling environments.\n\nThe harsh living and working conditions in Packingtown were so severe that many people worked themselves to the point of exhaustion and death. There were no support systems or agencies to provide information or assistance to workers. Unions were often more exploitative than helpful, profiting from the very workers they were supposed to protect. The workers were essentially trapped in this system, leading to a slave-like existence, as Sinclair wrote, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various tactics to convey specific feelings or attitudes about significant subjects, and some methods are more impactful than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns that wouldn't typically be associated to evoke a certain atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he invests symbols with meaning and then uses them for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently employs this latter technique with colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald endows these colors with significance, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to remind readers of certain feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns white/gray the connotation of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and higher social class, and gray signifying something older and faded. He establishes this significance early in the novel with repeated references to these colors. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (page 8), and everyone at Gatsby’s party wears white: Nick wears “white flannels” (page 41), Tom wears a “white shirt” (page 36), and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (page 30). The only time people are not in white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: the “halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (page 40). Fitzgerald further emphasizes these colors by coloring many mundane subjects in them: Nick’s commute to work leads him “down the white chasms of lower New York” (page 56), the names of party guests are “gray names” (page 61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” — uniformity (page 28). He also describes ordinary people or places in these colors: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (page 19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (page 23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (page 26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (page 27).\n\nAfter imbuing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald uses them to represent unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. This technique to show readers something begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster.” Readers start to see Daisy as less of a character, more like a uniform addition that Gatsby yearns for (page 74). Fitzgerald employs this method consistently around Daisy to evoke the impression of her being an unimportant, uniform addition. For example, her fur collar is a “gray haze” (page 18), and she is again in a “white” (page 115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is an incredibly fertile region, thanks to its mild and sunny climate. Popular crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is robust in the area, with many local organizations facing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farm would allow the landowner to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat, offering recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs. Organic farming can also lead to greater biodiversity of both plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water, although it often comes with higher costs in terms of labor and management. Additionally, practices beneficial to wildlife can add to these costs, such as planting cover crops and managing invasive species. This could make the landowner seek financial assistance or expertise in maximizing both profit and habitat quality. The chosen land is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently includes over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. This area has been home to Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing or wood production for many years. I chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. As a model for farming this land, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by culture, which is more than just what it is, but also what it isn't. It's not uniform, not singular, and not limited to national borders. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the reality of cultural nuances. A negotiator should focus on how the cultural context impacts the negotiation, rather than making sweeping assumptions. When venturing into unfamiliar territory, it's natural to compare it to one's own cultural framework, but it's crucial to respect and understand the differences.\n\nGetting to know a culture can mean learning its history, understanding its prejudices, or simply appreciating its customs. Don't aim to change or judge a culture, but rather work within its parameters, especially when you're in a weaker bargaining position. Being in \"away\" territory means embracing the traditions and beliefs that could be barriers, and using them to move the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences; it's also about corporate cultures within a nation. Some companies promote long work hours, others emphasize a relaxed schedule. Indicators of corporate culture can be found in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same nation, corporate cultures vary greatly. For instance, American corporate culture differs vastly from one company to another, and even within a company, there can be regional differences.\n\nValues are key to understanding a culture as they provide the 'why' behind cultural behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator must be sensitive to not disrespect those values. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values hard negotiation tactics may not be eager to settle early. Knowing these generalities before the negotiation begins is important, but also consider your opponent's personal traits to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This infamous phrase is found at the outset of Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and also serves as the launching point for St. Anselm’s argument on the existence of God, a stance seemingly shared by Thomas Aquinas. To compare their arguments effectively, we’ll start by accepting their shared belief in the Bible’s God. However, neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nLet’s first break down Anselm’s core argument. He posits that the proof for God's existence lies within our own minds, as God is within our understanding. While his explanation can be convoluted, it essentially boils down to trusting our inherent knowledge of God's existence. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts, as it does not rely on empirical evidence.\n\nContrarily, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God’s existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence with no need for faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of new converts without requiring belief in something unprovable. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support this, each demonstrating the necessity of God's existence in the world. For instance, if you have a puzzle missing a piece, you can infer the existence and features of that piece through logic alone.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later become known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he disavowed the world, attained enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional branch. Now over two and a half millennia old, the religion has evolved extensively. You can see this change in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate, but Buddha himself never taught about such an event. These modifications extend from simple traditions to the very core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both in its monastic and lay forms, has had to adapt its teachings over time, influenced by a mix of external and internal pressures, both positive and negative.\n\nThere are several key terms we'll use throughout this discussion. Internal forces refer to those originating from members of the Buddha's teachings, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are any influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that don't necessarily aim to help or harm the community but may do so as a side effect. We'll use these terms frequently as we proceed.\n\nFirst, let's delve into the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, the three baskets, of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by acknowledging these concepts can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With this escape comes the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets rules for life, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (I will not kill, lie, steal, misbehave sexually, or take intoxicants) and monks following many more rules. The most fundamental teaching in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States conquered Mexico and seized Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Various conflicts and skirmishes between the two nations continued until just before World War I. The rivalry began due to differing views on key issues like religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis tense relationship is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Border-sharing nations often find themselves in rivalries due to overlapping interests and disputes (David M. Pletcher 1977 p. 41). Unlike other Latin American nations, Mexico and Cuba have a long history of rivalry with the United States. Religious differences also played a significant role in their strained relationship. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, much like the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was a mix of ideological struggle and competition for strategic interests. This distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial past, posed a significant obstacle to friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from raids by bandits and outlaws from border towns. This persisted until both nations began exerting military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The rivalry started to diminish as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States. It ended as American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness I was unaware of. I was a nurse at the time, drawn to the profession for the safety and security it offered, a stark contrast to my upbringing. \"You'll always have a job; people will always need care,\" was the mantra that guided me through adolescence and beyond. My dream was to be a scientist or journalist, but nursing seemed the practical choice.\n\nYet here I was: 46 years old, single, and unable to work due to disability. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and despite my efforts, I have little remaining that is truly mine. My life is a constant struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few kind friends.\n\nMy point is that life throws emergencies at us, big and small. No amount of preparation can guard against everything. I agree that we should not rely solely on big government, but I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, rather than each person trying to survive alone.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk of rugged individualism, but history tells us it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that kept our forefathers going through hard times. The pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone in wagon trains.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and more. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Ever wondered why organisms evolve the way they do? Are there specific restraints or limitations that shape the path of evolutionary change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson noted that even today, zoologists have barely scratched the surface in describing organic forms mathematically. Modern mathematical modeling has been applied to mollusk skeletogenesis through both growth and evolutionary history, as seen in studies like Raup and Stanley's work in 1981. Our research explores how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, in tandem with experimental studies, can shed light on the processes driving the direction and extent of these changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that help model hypothetical and real shell morphologies using the CerioShell software. These models help interpret the possible limits of morphological change in Prunum, combining with experimental and descriptive studies to understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be seen as a tube that wraps around over time through 360 degrees of space, with each complete turn called a whorl. These whorls spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The speed and size of whorls can vary, with each whorl separated by a continuous line known as a suture. The largest whorl, the body whorl, is typically the last one. The spire is the part of the shell excluding the body whorl, with the apex at the tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and find the start of the first suture. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal grows its shell. This movement can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius. Mathematically representing this trajectory allows for parameter adjustments and modifications to the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Every year, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia stays roughly the same, despite notable progress in other areas such as water and sanitation. The country is lagging behind in improving child and maternal health, which threatens to miss its 2015 targets. To understand these issues, a closer look at the health system is needed, rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen a rise in births attended by skilled health workers, now at 72%. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who can't provide medical interventions in case of complications. Moreover, there's been a drop in the number of children under five treated for diarrhea by a health professional, and postnatal care remains a significant concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, around 4%, with urban areas at 7% and rural at a mere 2%. This disparity indicates inequitable access to healthcare services, with urban areas receiving more attention. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, highlighting the financial barriers to care for the less privileged.\n\nAs we move forward, the core question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches, or strengthen the overall health system, including pre and post-pregnancy care? Programmatic approaches offer clear objectives and swift results, but they can also lead to funding and resource imbalances, and uncoordinated, duplicated services.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their concentration on the upper class of the era. Two novels, however, are exceptions to this norm: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and the peculiar, deviating from the period's typical fare. This unique approach enhances the characters, offering deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist grapples with the strange events unfolding around him, he is haunted by vivid, dreamlike visions. In one such sequence, he finds himself conversing with Sikes and Crackit, who are in a heated argument. Suddenly, gunshots ring out, and Oliver is thrust into chaos, his senses overwhelmed. Throughout this turmoil, he is plagued by a persistent, undefined pain. This shooting experience leaves Oliver feeling powerless and defeated, unable to control his fate. The fact that he cannot muster the will to save himself, even in the face of imminent danger, suggests that Fagin’s influence has broken him, leaving him to accept this despair. The lack of control Oliver feels is emphasized by his inability to influence the outcome of the shooting, despite his life being at stake.",
            "A few years back, I was working in an after-school program, assisting elementary students with their schoolwork, and my forte was English and reading. It wasn't long before I was recruited to help a young boy named Adrian, a third or fourth grader, who was having trouble reading. The more I worked with him, the more peculiar his reading difficulties became. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others were off by a mile. Despite being of Latino descent and speaking perfect English, Adrian's struggles with reading were puzzling. It wasn't until I met his mother that it all clicked – Adrian could read, he just hadn't mastered the English alphabet. While I'm not sure if my intervention helped him much, I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of the language barrier, especially in California schools. It's not always as clear-cut as we think. A child speaking perfect English can still struggle with reading. Everyone agrees this is an issue, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple – English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for children with limited English skills, it's much more complex. There's no magic answer. Combining dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is key.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is brilliant. It's not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" While there's fear surrounding this approach, that it's a waste of resources and won't benefit the majority, these fears are unfounded. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. So, how do we achieve this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. However, having bilingual aids or tutors in classrooms makes sense.",
            "From childhood, we're often told there's something greater than ourselves, a force beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school, temple, or look within for answers. Many of us embrace the religions our parents instilled in us, while others reject them, claiming there's nothing beyond our personal universe. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds. Regardless of our journey, we strive to define ourselves through our unique perspectives of spirituality, searching for a light in the darkness to guide us to the sun.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain drumming on the tin roof, and smoked our cigarettes together. Gutters carried the rain, drowning plants along the edge. He gazed into the falling rain, his eyes searching, remembering. His body had grown frail from months of illness, and his hair was thinner than I recalled. He didn't make eye contact, and I felt alone, afraid, unable to talk about how much I'd miss him. I hugged him, then sat closer, and together we watched the June twilight's rain.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation had only extended his suffering; I couldn't comprehend the purpose of it. A God that would do this was silent to me.

            "The classic Gothic Novel is, in essence and name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" according to Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has faced both criticism and praise, with some labeling it shallow and others marveling at its 'terrible sublime' allure (Burke). The founding text, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended old theatrical elements and new novelistic techniques to give birth to the proto-Gothic genre. Walpole's \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4) uses medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, drawing upon the archaic or unsophisticated connotations of the term \"gothic\" in the face of modern societal advancements. The fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's personal perspective on character psychology is what has kept Gothic literature alive, both antiquated and fresh, for centuries.\n\nOne central theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers as it represents the ideals of bravery, honor, and competence. Walpole, writing during politically tumultuous times, may have felt that the moral goodness of the Gothic era had faded in contemporary society, inspiring him to idealize and romanticize the 'gothic past' through his writing. Characters like Frederic embody this chivalric spirit, described as a prince, a victim of tragedy, and slain by infidels. Frederic's character is exaggerated, embodying the soon-to-be iconic Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the set of processes that move goods from the customer's order to the stage of raw materials, through production, and distribution to the customer. The concept was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982. He described it as the planning, implementation, and control of activities along the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and effectively. Key elements include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these elements to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nThe first step in this process is production. This is the backbone of the entire supply chain. Production involves deciding when, why, where, and how everything will be made. Managers need to understand customer preferences, which they can gauge through market analysis. By examining the market, they can determine customer demands and decide what products to produce and in what quantities. They also determine the optimal location for production, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. After setting the production location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial, and each detail must be meticulously planned to avoid long-term costs. For instance, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, both of which have detailed processes for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. These outlined processes ensure smooth operation and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply. It involves making strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and determining which outsourcing partnerships to pursue. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the best division for each process. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to increase velocity. Velocity refers to providing high-quality, flexible service while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country governed by a brutal military junta. In 2007, protests led by Buddhist monks, known as the Saffron Revolution, erupted in the streets. At first, the government permitted monks to gather peacefully, but later, violence escalated, leading to the military's invasion of monasteries and the imprisonment of foreign journalists. The official death toll stands at 13, but a former soldier, Colonel Hla Win, claims many more died.\n\nThis is not a new occurrence.

Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered gods, and our current president, George W. Bush, is rumored to have weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a party affiliate.\n\nNotable examples of such atrocities include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest authoritarian rule, with the death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates.

            "Duke Ellington’s enduring influence on jazz can be attributed to his longevity and his unmatched ability to mold his orchestra into a versatile ensemble. His piano playing, while often subtle, serves as the foundation for many of his compositions, which beautifully highlight the individual talents of his band members. As a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that allowed for solo improvisation, while also writing highly orchestrated sections that showcased each musician’s unique style. By doing so, he created cohesive and distinct sounds that brought each piece to life. Ellington’s masterful understanding of his players’ sounds and how they blended together in a growing ensemble resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant recordings in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s innovative use of voice as an instrument throughout his career. His piece Creole Love Call is a notable early example of this, where he used voice to add depth and color without the distraction of lyrics. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each showcasing a different soloist and call and response technique. These choruses illustrate Ellington’s ability to complement the style of his soloists, a skill that permeates his entire career.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his talent for tight orchestration with his keen ear for tone color. He achieves this by using “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet call and response with Baby Cox’s scat singing. The interplay between Miley’s vocal elements and Cox’s instrumental voice creates a rich, complementary sound. Ellington’s masterful use of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further demonstrates this ability.\n\nEllington’s innovative use of voice to add tone color to his pieces is a recurring stylistic trait that sets his work apart.",
            "She'd always felt a strange emptiness, a yearning for something she couldn't quite put her finger on. It began when she was 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted despite the passage of three years. At 17, she decided she wanted a relationship, but no one seemed to ignite her interest. She pondered this peculiar situation endlessly, but her contemplation yielded no satisfying answers. Thus, she carried on with life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, her parents were peaceful and harmonious, their arguments scarce, save for those with their daughter about her independent spirit. She was the lively daughter of calm parents, her personality a vibrant contrast to their peaceful energies. Today, however, tranquility seemed to have fled. As she wandered through the house seeking inspiration, a piercing scream echoed from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, usually so beautiful, was filled with pain. She rushed to the source, her heart pounding. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried. Her mother lay on the floor, groaning, \"Ow.\" Her daughter rushed to her side, putting a hand on her, \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the - hospital.\" Her words were rushed, and her pain evident. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where,\" she said, grateful for the strength she'd gained from her training. She carefully carried her mother to the car and drove to the hospital, the scent of disinfectant and fear filling her nostrils. She rushed her mother inside, calling for help. Concerned faces gathered, and her mother was quickly taken away to be examined. She was left to wait, herheart heavy with worry.\n\nHer mother had climbed a ladder to reach a vase from the highest cabinet, but the step stool toppled, sending her crashing to the ground.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet score, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower risk of stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious research has shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also discovered that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without prior CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to assess nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses remained throughout the entire study period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounding factors (which could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe study found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile were at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States endured a devastating financial calamity. The unemployment rate soared, the housing market imploded, and many of America's most influential businesses were left in shambles. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting us to examine how it came to pass and how we might prevent a recurrence. Simply put, the crisis was cultivated by shortsighted political decisions that compelled banks and corporations to disburse sub-prime loans to an already perilous financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDO's and CDS's. When borrowers defaulted, banks were left with depleted capital reserves and passed the resulting chaos on to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in 1999 during the Clinton administration. President Clinton, seeking a second term, eased lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move ultimately prepared the ground for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times observed in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, has been increasingly pressured by the Clinton Administration to expand loans to low and moderate-income individuals and has faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As elaborated upon, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would inevitably result in the economy's collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic freefall, one of which was the innovative mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) were extensively utilized in the years preceding the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This overleveraging left both U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which constituted about 30% of the USA's GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold off at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to operate as commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your tale where you attempt to take flight, captivating your audience with your spellbinding words, or the section where your readers nod off and hit the \"Back\" button, muttering your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of it, feeling like she's been trapped in a never-ending monologue.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the fundamental writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into stretches of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder whispering, \"Get the boring parts out of the way to reach the good stuff\" (not to be confused with the other devil on your shoulder, urging you to tell your audience every detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition means sharing the details of what happened in simple prose. In movies, exposition occurs when one character dumps information onto another, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific place and time, that they married in a grand style, and that her husband was killed in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with both of them speaking only a few lines. You'd expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. You'd also expect the heroine to reveal her feelings for him in subtle ways, reflecting how his presence in her life has changed and enriched her (especially if the story later reveals this explicitly). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and the heroine's character: you'd learn what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect substance behind the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add that meat. (*looks at the metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, now he's the night manager of a gas station, he's been married twice, has no kids, likes to fish on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live NBC 4 report from this morning (August 13, 2011), featured a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. His mugshot showed a face that seemed to epitomize evil, and he received a mere two minutes of coverage. The story was relatively brief, but I thought the time given was appropriate.\nThe second story concerned the shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old man in the Sharon Woods area. He had been critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was conducting an investigation. This story seemed brief, which I believe was due to the victim being a minority. I've noticed this tendency for years; if a white person is a crime victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, it barely gets a mention.\nThe third story was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators believe it was caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\nThe fourth story was about Saturday's predicted rain and thunderstorms. They mentioned the weekend's mid to low 80°F temperatures, but the report was quite short, serving as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\nAnother story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. The amount of time the reporter spent emphasizing his race seemed unusual.\nLastly, they reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I found it curious that they mentioned his Hispanic heritage, as it didn't seem relevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection as deep and intricate as the roots of an ancient tree. In this bond, emotions dance and clash, a symphony of love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, all bound together in an unspoken understanding. Brothers see in each other a reflection of themselves, a truth that is harder to accept than any other. It is in the darkest moments, when the storms of emotion rage, that this bond reveals its true power. The price of understanding the emotions that flow from this fraternal bond is high, for it demands we confront the consequences that come with them. Seeing the truth in another's eyes, we see ourselves not as others see us, but as we truly are. Our actions and their consequences bare our character for all to see. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme, and the complex emotions it brings. Through a landscape vividly described, these boys embark on a journey that leads to a dramatic conclusion. The protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together, to their final, tragic encounter, he feels resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother he could teach and bond with, someone to share his adventures with, but Doodle's frail heart made that impossible. His dreams were shattered, and he even contemplated harming his brother. Yet, when Doodle smiled at him, his heart softened. This emotional rollercoaster shows that, despite his intentions, he had an innate love for his brother. The narrator's perspective also highlights the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, both of which greatly influence his actions.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing apparatus. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll of papyrus, next to a book, and most recently to a computer. When exploring brain science, remember that these metaphors only go so far and can lead to false conclusions. Information's journey begins with the sensory organs, converting physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and object borders to identify it as a box. Top-down processing aids in this recognition, helping you recognize it as a black box rather than a hole. Once processed, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and its access to cognitive processes. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter keeps you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you notice your name spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, each modulated by attention. To process information, it must first be stored in different types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded in specific ways for each sensory stimulus; verbal input, for example, can be encoded by its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest working memory, which holds information briefly, is maintained by a looping electrical signal in specific neurons. Long-term memory information is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins. There are various models of knowledge organization in the brain, ranging from human memory retrieval to computer science to neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stance against the impending dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. The story unfolds in a dystopian future where people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to chase immediate happiness. The citizens, in reality, are mere pawns in a grand scheme controlled by the World Controller. Marxist ideology shines through in this critique, as the author expresses concerns about the development of these systems. Key Marxist concepts like homogenization and reification highlight the faults of the emerging capitalist economy from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is skewered through the lens of false consciousness, a Marxist idea where the common people are kept unaware of true economic relations. This is evident in Brave New World where people are more interested in personal gain than understanding their place in the economic system. The conditioning through hypnopædia drives the populace to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony is clear here, with the lower classes dominated by the ruling class, unaware of their manipulation. The upper classes, like Alphas or Betas, accept their role, with few characters like Bernard questioning their place. The superficial interactions and lack of depth among characters suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism segregates individuals, stripping them of free will and expression. Love and deep emotions are absent, with interactions reduced to discussions about physical appearances. This reflects the societal complacency and obedience to the capitalist hierarchy. In essence, Brave New World uses capitalism's socioeconomic effects to showcase the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who believe they are superior as long as they consume, obey, and blend in with their peers.",
            "I've been a University Park student for nearly three years, which equates to a little over four semesters. Navigating the campus can be a real challenge for many, including myself. My first year, I was placed in an East Halls dorm room, as far east as you can get without counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes like those in the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially on bad weather days, which are frequent in State College. An alum, not much older than myself, shared that not long ago, East Halls were separated from the rest of the school by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and the surrounding apartments. As our campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. The solution? Bicycles. But bikes alone won’t solve the problem; they must be used, and the campus must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who started cycling again after a long break. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a few years, it wasn’t cool to ride one, but it’s the only way to get around.\" Apart from being great for your body, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, equally distant from the center of campus as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I attend class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes. The only snag is Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, which isn’t always the easiest to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its advantages, I’m too busy to do it. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option for class. Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, which totals over two and a half hours each week. I’d have even more time to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, which is time I can’t afford to spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",

This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I aim to work in the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on helping abused or neglected children, and supporting troubled families. The values I bring to the field include service, respect, ethical practice, commitment to strengthening relationships, and a dedication to professional growth to remain skilled. These are not just professional values; they are deeply personal to me.\n\nGrowing up, I've always desired to assist others, but I was uncertain about my career path. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people retreat from their problems in denial and some used coping strategies that weren't ideal. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still undecided about my career, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. One day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police. To assist, I drove to his parents’ house, where I privately shared my concerns with the police. They asked me to speak with the parents, as they were powerless to intervene. When I questioned the parents about their son’s behavior, they seemed defensive and blamed him for involving outsiders in \"simple\" disputes. This experience sparked my interest in social work to help children with family conflicts.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. Society claims to value individuals but often follows outdated traditions rather than embracing uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual and reject limiting myself to fit into others' molds. Throughout high school and college, I protested social injustice: I colored my hair unnatural colors, wore expressive clothing, pierced my ears beyond the norm, joined the GSBA, and fought against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "This document explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in the context of insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic factors and medical aspects that influence sleep disorders. On the other hand, the Sociocultural model investigates the environmental influences that relate to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review that follows examines these models and presents research that pertains to and elucidates them. The research findings are then critically evaluated to highlight their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia, a sleep disorder, can be categorized as either a primary sleep disorder, one related to another mental disorder, or one stemming from medical conditions or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those related to mental disorders fall under Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Other categories encompass sleep disorders due to medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias, which include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), pertain to issues with initiating or maintaining sleep. Primary Insomnia, for instance, is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia refers to difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve sleep disorders linked to behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. These include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers on genes, inherited factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that are specifically responsible for sleep/wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A defect or absence of this receptor could alter one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The Sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, it could regulate sleep. An alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual, negatively impacting aspects of life such as school, career, and everyday tasks that require focus.",
            "This document delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise definition of the condition. It then outlines the diagnostic process, highlighting common symptoms, or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it concludes with strategies for teachers working in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. Simply put, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly process sounds, distinguishing words from background noise, despite normal hearing. Individuals with CAPD can hear perfectly but face difficulties in the brain's processing of what they hear.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for children with communicative disorders in 1954. Kimura introduced dichotic testing and explained the physiological basis of the central nervous system's role in dichotic perception in 1961. A 1977 national conference further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents in various forms, including difficulty in localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and synthesizing sound clues meaningfully. It can also manifest as a struggle to determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists use various measures to assess auditory-related skills. There is no single, consistently reliable test, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown. Tests typically present multiple auditory stimuli and ask for differentiation. Advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals in the ear and measuring responses.",
            "Twelfth Night teaches that while disguise can be a powerful tool to maintain deception for extended periods, it ultimately requires the wearer to shed that false persona to prevent losing one's true self. The challenge lies in ending the charade, as it may lead to feelings of alienation. One must then choose between preserving self-identity or maintaining relationships. Some may accept the deception without issue, but others might be offended. The theme of gender role reversal in deception is complex, raising questions like why someone might feel the need to assume an opposite-gender guise. In Viola’s case, it's a form of self-defense: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola masquerades as a man to safeguard herself from potential threats. Her scheme works, but it isolates her from the female community, and she finds herself in a romantic turmoil with Olivia and Orsino: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) While this could be seen as progressive, to a modern reader, Twelfth Night might demonstrate how deception can help uncover suppressed emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. Unshed feelings may be forced to the surface due to Viola/Cesario's presence. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because she thinks he's a man, or does she secretly harbor affection for women? It seems unlikely, as Olivia's character seems to mock those who judge others solely on appearance. This is evident in her quick shift from Cesario to Sebastian, and her familial acceptance of Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has long been criticized for its harshness, notably in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. However, it's crucial to note that a broad colonial empire like Germany's cannot be defined by such a singular description. The empire's policies and administration varied greatly across its diverse geography. Educational systems also differed significantly. After taking over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British found a well-educated African population. Similarly, contemporary authors praised German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies. Yet, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) starkly contrasted this. Unlike in East Africa, where the state played a key role in educating natives, in South West Africa, the responsibility largely fell to missionary societies with limited government support. The German government heavily invested in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools. These policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted educated African populations, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to explore these factors, especially new research on settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes towards native Africans.\n\nMany sources discuss education in the German colonial empire, most in German and written during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works mainly described educational systems, while later English works expanded on these discussions through comparisons and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems across colonies. Notably, Cohen's study compared educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, attributing differences to South West Africa's large settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa's climate was generally more temperate than other German colonies, with much of the territory being desert. The European population reflected this, with nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa by 1913, compared to only 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The landscape of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the past century, leading to a vast array of genres, with each having numerous sub and sub-sub genres. For instance, rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk have all given birth to various sub-genres. Within this expansive canvas, Heavy Metal rock has stood out, becoming one of the most expressive and diverse genres in the past four decades. Its diversity stems from its early realization of flexibility, inspiring the creation of numerous sub-genres that continue to multiply today.\n\nToday, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that defining what 'heavy metal' truly is can be challenging. It has absorbed themes from various other genres, yet its roots remain in a movement characterized by darkness. Metal is often described as a 'music of more'—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Musicians in this genre are highly skilled, showcasing their instrumental prowess in their music. Additionally, the genre has a strong connection to drug culture, notably driven by the psychedelic boom of the mid-70s. This movement reflects many dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively new to popular music at the time. Later generations of metal bands have also drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's darker themes. Lyrics, like the ones from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, exemplify this darkness:\n\n\"Helter Skelter,\" a song by The Beatles, exhibits the genre's darker side, portraying the ups and downs supposedly inspired by drug use. This track is considered one of the first heavy metal songs, responding to a heavier, darker song by The Rolling Stones. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to create a similarly intense sound, which they achieved with \"Helter Skelter.\"",
            "Before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the Post-Impressionist artist, showcases not just a woman in awe of a dream landscape, but also Rousseau’s personal dreams and goals as a painter. He yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art world he admired, but faced an internal dilemma: conform to mimic established styles to gain acceptance, or remain creatively independent and unique. The Dream is the painting that best embodies this lifelong struggle in Rousseau’s career.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, one must first know Rousseau's story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he was a tinsmith's son who grew up without formal art training. He worked as a gabelou until his forties and pursued painting as a source of comfort after the deaths of his wife and infant children. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average working class.\n\nRousseau’s ambition to gain acceptance from the art world is understandable given his context: he was untrained, started late, and worked alongside renowned artists. It wasn’t until around the same time Matisse gained recognition that Rousseau began to receive proper acknowledgment. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse wanted to avoid clichés, Rousseau’s desire was to paint conventionally enough to be admitted to the Artiste Français.",
            "Time and again, notable thinkers have posited a deep tie between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I contend that at a core level, there's a reason for this. As John Keats penned in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—/ That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to find ethics and aesthetics appealing without being taught them in these conventional ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are efforts to describe, not prescribe. Our examinations of morality and beauty are usually attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior. More to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these don't explain why it's good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, one often hears a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more detailed explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully explained by describing their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor states, “A story is a way of saying something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Similarly, ethics possesses this transcendent quality. As Wittgenstein put it, “Ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / I suggest that it is this 'something,' this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most potent attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them. I believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both in a noumenal way, using a Kantian term. They affect us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger in the art of literature. As McKean asserts, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany is a formidable nation, bound together by a distinct culture that spans from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic Sea shores of Kiel. This culture is evident from Cologne on the Rhine, through Germany's heart, to the picturesque city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given this unique cultural tapestry, it's unsurprising that modern Germany is a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name with disputed origins among scholars and historians. Some believe it comes from the Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to clash with the Gauls. Others propose that \"Germanus\" was a term used by Julius Caesar to differentiate the Germanic tribes he had not conquered from the Gauls he had, a word he borrowed from the Gauls themselves (Tacitus, 98). Still others suggest the name might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the loud and noisy nature of the Germans. (O.E.D., 2010)\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as \"aboriginal\" and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse. He noted that those who sought to emigrate would arrive by sea, and questioned why anyone would leave the comforts of Rome for the harsh climate and customs of Germania (Tacitus, 98).\n\nMeanwhile, the Romans would send their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods and services, and sometimes led military campaigns but generally returned to their sprawling empire. As the Germanic tribes began appearing in the first century, they lived along the Roman Empire's borders, trading their land-based goods and military skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I gazed down at the bowl in front of me, my mind working like a machine, analyzing every detail with cold detachment. It was a scene from a book I'd once bought, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" a gift from a painter I'd worked with. The book taught how to frame a complex image into something manageable, like a bowl of fruit on a plain plane. Yet, the sight before me was too much. I could see the influence of great artists - Picasso's blue period, Monet's love for greenery, the Italian Renaissance masters' color palettes. If I could ever claim artistic merit, this was my starting point, my first story, \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers wrapped around my pencil, muscles tensing and releasing as I made my first mark.

            "Teenagers are perishing behind the wheel. A confluence of factors opens up this treacherous route in teen driving statistics. The National Institutes of Health highlight that a key issue is that the teen brain is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving. Lack of experience also plays a significant role. This inexperience increases the likelihood of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teenagers also fare poorly when accompanied by peers, a scenario that is common, according to the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center. Their study correlated the passenger's age with the frequency of traffic accidents. Various states have introduced provisional licenses to limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers, but these are merely bandaid solutions. The core problem is that, collectively, young drivers are statistically not ready to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman posits that 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license. USA Today reports that Zuckerman's research suggests a common urge among teens under 19-20 to seek thrills, making it logical to delay driving until these tendencies subside. Continuing to grant licenses to young teens will likely lead to an escalating death toll as Baby-Boomers' children become eligible to drive in the coming years. Legislation to address this could involve schools offering driver’s education but not allowing anyone under 18 to operate a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full license, with a set number of training hours required, similar to current state requirements. A national law would uniformly protect teens across the nation. This approach is far from unprecedented.",
            "As I browsed through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I came across fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My study of these films generally involved describing the poetics of most trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few later ones. Early trick films at the turn of the century are typically set-bound, framed within a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and use long and medium shots, adhering to the one shot equals one film rule. However, some films from the early twentieth century dared to break these guidelines by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among these trick films is their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style, rooted in theatre and vaudeville, means that characters in trick films generally move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never leaving the frame as the camera doesn't follow them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in shots that are mostly long and occasionally medium, with close-ups never used. This stems from the theatre tradition, where the audience saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders. Actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent.\n\nThese early trick films typically follow the rule that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting most films to about a minute or less. This also restricts their dramatic or narrative use, often focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and switching acts with minimal story. However, keep in mind that one conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes doesn't necessarily correspond to one physical shot. A single \"shot\" might consist of several joined together to create an illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, observe The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. A closer look reveals the moment when the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",

            "Referring back to Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was quite disheartening. It's tough to pinpoint the exact reason, but the onset of winter in a New England campus likely contributed to the drop in bicycle and pedestrian commuters. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, when everyone is focused on completing schoolwork and processing grades, which might have caused the log submissions to fall off the radar. The month-long holiday break for students and faculty also means many don't need to commute, and classes resuming in late January could explain the low February submissions. Despite these factors, the February slump remains unexplained. It's possible that the project experienced a natural decline in initial excitement, which we tried to combat with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This blitz campaign did result in an increase in log submissions for March. Maintaining project momentum, especially considering the holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education, proved challenging. Another hurdle was the deep-rooted preference for driving, which prompted the need for incentives. We offered numerous prizes like gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, and even chain stores. However, we wondered if larger prizes like bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars could have sparked greater participation. The value of these prizes remained steady throughout the project. If we had announced increased prize values over time, such as adding bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that aims to replicate the performance of an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets. Unlike index funds, ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, offering more flexibility. They provide the diversification benefits of an index fund and the advantages of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and purchase just one share. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, they come with the downside of incurring commissions on trades, as with buying or selling stocks. ETFs also offer a wide variety of funds to choose from, but it's crucial for savvy investors to assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, actually exist and to what extent.\n\nFor this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF, comparing it with its top 10 holdings, which represent 63.58% of its assets. Below are the top holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can normalize their current asset percentages to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion they are held in the ETF. Beta and return calculations are included in the chart below.\n\nFrom the chart, it is clear that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, indicating a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top 10 holdings is also 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of just these top 10 stocks could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, statistical significance needs to be verified.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Dream-Land, one of Edgar Allan Poe's own self-proclaimed better poems, features the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Poe was evidently familiar with European literature, as seen in his use of the term, which Virgil employed to describe an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world to the ancient Greeks. Beyond Virgil's usage, some scholars attribute Poe's familiarity with the term \"Thule\" to his interest in German authors, namely Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThis connection is significant as it highlights Poe's knowledge of Goethe's work, specifically his drama \"Faust,\" which was first published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after losing his wife and giving her a goblet as a gift, descends into heavy drinking and despair. He eventually decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the sea and walking off a cliff. The similarity between the King of Thule and the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is striking, suggesting a possible connection to Poe's own experiences with loss and alcohol.\n\nPoe utilizes \"Thule\" twice in his works. In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he mentions \"ultma Thule,\" while in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describing a dark, lonely landscape haunted by the memories of lost friends. This scene mirrors the despair and loneliness of the King of Thule from Goethe's poem, as if Poe stepped into Goethe's world. Goethe was indeed a notable author, and Poe would have been exposed to his work through the many reproductions that circulated after the original publications. Additionally, Poe's admiration for Tennyson would have further drawn him to Goethe's work.",
            "Could a customer injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a California grocery store be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating the store manager's malicious intent, given that he knew about the spill and failed to clean it for half an hour while eating dinner?\n\nA California judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages outright. To prove malice, Palmer must show Martin's actions were deliberately cruel and showed disregard for probable harm. She can argue that Martin should have known about the risk of slips because of previous incidents, but still chose to ignore it. While her argument that Martin was despicable is less convincing, it's still reasonable given that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take action.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, Rich Wayne reported the spill to Martin, who was on a dinner break and didn't have time to clean it up. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin, but he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before her accident, five similar incidents had occurred in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we’re considering filing a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual acts of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a)). Malice is defined as conduct that intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was despicable and committed with willful disregard for others' safety. (id. § 3294(c)(1)). Courts consider conduct malicious if the defendant was aware of the probable danger of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid it. (Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979)).",
            "About four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. The class sparked heated debates over whether Islam is inherently hostile. This topic feels more pertinent today than ever. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the American media shift from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an unusually tolerant stance. In 2001, it's hard to imagine a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a clear Muslim background, gaining traction.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography piqued my interest, yet it clashes with my understanding of his character. Traditional accounts portray Muhammad as a conqueror, forcing conversions upon tribes. His biography, however, depicts him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly accepting people's faith. This narrative seems to devalue Muhammad's actions and overshadow Jesus' miracles with similar tales.\n\nThe similarities between Jesus' and Muhammad's ministries are striking, particularly the miracle of multiplying mutton and milk. This style of writing suggests Muhammad needed no proof, merely living in truth and miracles. This approach dilutes Jesus' life and miracle, giving credit to Muhammad.\n\nMany stories in the biography seem designed to validate 'witness' conversions, yet they often rely on third-party accounts, diminishing credibility. They portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man, yet historical records contradict this portrayal.\n\nThe thing that really bothers me is their attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure. If Muslims today knew the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power, it would shed light on this dichotomy.",
            "Every era after Jesus left behind his teachings and beliefs, and Christian thought evolved in a direction that strayed from its origins. Observing this historical trajectory, we notice a persistent drift away from the religion's roots. Today, the world displays a heightened awareness and an unprecedented progressive inclination. While traditionalists persist, they may not significantly impact the broader population. Among Christians, a growing historical consciousness will emerge, fueling a desire to differentiate the doctrines that have accumulated over time from Jesus' original intent. This movement, though slow, is inevitable: it will reverse the trend of Christian history, returning it to its origin. A wave will grow, stripping away layers of doctrine as if rewinding the clock, until only the essence of Jesus' message remains. This reversal will permeate the United States and Europe, encouraging mass adherence to a faith centered solely on Jesus' ideas, with the church leading the charge. However, as the theological clock reverses, the diversity among Christians will diminish, leading to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and divisive differences will fade, replaced by growing similarities. History is replete with such reversals. For instance, Christians were initially persecuted by the Roman Empire but later saw its transformation into a Christian state. Our nation transitioned from African-American slavery to equality. This upcoming reversal will unfold within the realm of Christianity, undoing past diversions to return to the source. This shift will be enabled, in part, by interpreting Jesus' teachings metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired after Jesus' life? If we delve deep into history, we find only Judaism, the theological cradle of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures lay at its core by the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was fragmented into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I firmly believe that \"The Jungle\" showcases the inherent greed and self-interest that lies within human nature. People tend to prioritize their own well-being and strive to improve their lives, often without regard for those less fortunate. The novel demonstrates this through various instances, with the most notable being the factory owners and managers. Their primary objective is to expand and boost their business empires, disregarding any obstacles or collateral damage. Upton Sinclair's description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" vividly illustrates the detrimental effects of their actions. They display no concern for the people or animals harmed by the pollution or the animal waste run-off from the extensive pens around Packingtown.\n\nThe owners and managers also showed no empathy towards their employees, who were mere means to their wealth. They would exploit any opportunity to maximize profits, as Sinclair put it, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subjected their workers to harsh working conditions and arbitrarily laid off employees without notice or compensation. During this period, workers had little to no legal protection, leaving them vulnerable to the whims of their employers who pushed for increased productivity in grueling environments.\n\nThe harsh living and working conditions in Packingtown were so severe that many people worked themselves to the point of exhaustion and death. There were no support systems or agencies to provide information or assistance to workers. Unions were often more exploitative than helpful, profiting from the very workers they were supposed to protect. The workers were essentially trapped in this system, leading to a slave-like existence, as Sinclair wrote, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various tactics to convey specific feelings or attitudes about significant subjects, and some methods are more impactful than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns that wouldn't typically be associated to evoke a certain atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he invests symbols with meaning and then uses them for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently employs this latter technique with colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald endows these colors with significance, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to remind readers of certain feelings associated with important objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns white/gray the connotation of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and higher social class, and gray signifying something older and faded. He establishes this significance early in the novel with repeated references to these colors. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (page 8), and everyone at Gatsby’s party wears white: Nick wears “white flannels” (page 41), Tom wears a “white shirt” (page 36), and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (page 30). The only time people are not in white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: the “halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (page 40). Fitzgerald further emphasizes these colors by coloring many mundane subjects in them: Nick’s commute to work leads him “down the white chasms of lower New York” (page 56), the names of party guests are “gray names” (page 61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” — uniformity (page 28). He also describes ordinary people or places in these colors: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (page 19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (page 23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (page 26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (page 27).\n\nAfter imbuing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald uses them to represent unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects. This technique to show readers something begins with Daisy. After a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster.” Readers start to see Daisy as less of a character, more like a uniform addition that Gatsby yearns for (page 74). Fitzgerald employs this method consistently around Daisy to evoke the impression of her being an unimportant, uniform addition. For example, her fur collar is a “gray haze” (page 18), and she is again in a “white” (page 115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is an incredibly fertile region, thanks to its mild and sunny climate. Popular crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is robust in the area, with many local organizations facing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farm would allow the landowner to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat, offering recreational use, and creating opportunities for farm tours and educational programs. Organic farming can also lead to greater biodiversity of both plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water, although it often comes with higher costs in terms of labor and management. Additionally, practices beneficial to wildlife can add to these costs, such as planting cover crops and managing invasive species. This could make the landowner seek financial assistance or expertise in maximizing both profit and habitat quality. The chosen land is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently includes over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. This area has been home to Native Americans for centuries and was later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing or wood production for many years. I chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs. As a model for farming this land, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by culture, which is more than just what it is, but also what it isn't. It's not uniform, not singular, and not limited to national borders. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the reality of cultural nuances. A negotiator should focus on how the cultural context impacts the negotiation, rather than making sweeping assumptions. When venturing into unfamiliar territory, it's natural to compare it to one's own cultural framework, but it's crucial to respect and understand the differences.\n\nGetting to know a culture can mean learning its history, understanding its prejudices, or simply appreciating its customs. Don't aim to change or judge a culture, but rather work within its parameters, especially when you're in a weaker bargaining position. Being in \"away\" territory means embracing the traditions and beliefs that could be barriers, and using them to move the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences; it's also about corporate cultures within a nation. Some companies promote long work hours, others emphasize a relaxed schedule. Indicators of corporate culture can be found in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same nation, corporate cultures vary greatly. For instance, American corporate culture differs vastly from one company to another, and even within a company, there can be regional differences.\n\nValues are key to understanding a culture as they provide the 'why' behind cultural behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony is valued, a negotiator must be sensitive to not disrespect those values. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values hard negotiation tactics may not be eager to settle early. Knowing these generalities before the negotiation begins is important, but also consider your opponent's personal traits to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This infamous phrase is found at the outset of Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and also serves as the launching point for St. Anselm’s argument on the existence of God, a stance seemingly shared by Thomas Aquinas. To compare their arguments effectively, we’ll start by accepting their shared belief in the Bible’s God. However, neither Anselm nor Aquinas provides a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nLet’s first break down Anselm’s core argument. He posits that the proof for God's existence lies within our own minds, as God is within our understanding. While his explanation can be convoluted, it essentially boils down to trusting our inherent knowledge of God's existence. This is often referred to as faith in Christian texts, as it does not rely on empirical evidence.\n\nContrarily, Thomas Aquinas proposes that God’s existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence with no need for faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of new converts without requiring belief in something unprovable. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support this, each demonstrating the necessity of God's existence in the world. For instance, if you have a puzzle missing a piece, you can infer the existence and features of that piece through logic alone.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later become known as the Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he disavowed the world, attained enlightenment, and his teachings gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being the most traditional branch. Now over two and a half millennia old, the religion has evolved extensively. You can see this change in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and laypeople participate, but Buddha himself never taught about such an event. These modifications extend from simple traditions to the very core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both in its monastic and lay forms, has had to adapt its teachings over time, influenced by a mix of external and internal pressures, both positive and negative.\n\nThere are several key terms we'll use throughout this discussion. Internal forces refer to those originating from members of the Buddha's teachings, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are any influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that don't necessarily aim to help or harm the community but may do so as a side effect. We'll use these terms frequently as we proceed.\n\nFirst, let's delve into the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, the three baskets, of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by acknowledging these concepts can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. With this escape comes the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets rules for life, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (I will not kill, lie, steal, misbehave sexually, or take intoxicants) and monks following many more rules. The most fundamental teaching in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States conquered Mexico and seized Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Various conflicts and skirmishes between the two nations continued until just before World War I. The rivalry began due to differing views on key issues like religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis tense relationship is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Border-sharing nations often find themselves in rivalries due to overlapping interests and disputes (David M. Pletcher 1977 p. 41). Unlike other Latin American nations, Mexico and Cuba have a long history of rivalry with the United States. Religious differences also played a significant role in their strained relationship. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, much like the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was a mix of ideological struggle and competition for strategic interests. This distrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial past, posed a significant obstacle to friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were territorial in nature, stemming from raids by bandits and outlaws from border towns. This persisted until both nations began exerting military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). The rivalry started to diminish as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States. It ended as American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt 1974 p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness I was unaware of. I was a nurse at the time, drawn to the profession for the safety and security it offered, a stark contrast to my upbringing. \"You'll always have a job; people will always need care,\" was the mantra that guided me through adolescence and beyond. My dream was to be a scientist or journalist, but nursing seemed the practical choice.\n\nYet here I was: 46 years old, single, and unable to work due to disability. I've been living on Social Security Disability for 15 years, and despite my efforts, I have little remaining that is truly mine. My life is a constant struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I couldn't have made it this far without my family and a few kind friends.\n\nMy point is that life throws emergencies at us, big and small. No amount of preparation can guard against everything. I agree that we should not rely solely on big government, but I'd rather see Americans learn to trust and help each other again, rather than each person trying to survive alone.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk of rugged individualism, but history tells us it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that kept our forefathers going through hard times. The pioneers didn't cross the Rockies alone in wagon trains.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and more.

            "Ever wondered why organisms evolve the way they do? Are there specific restraints or limitations that shape the path of evolutionary change? In 1917, D’Arcy Thompson noted that even today, zoologists have barely scratched the surface in describing organic forms mathematically. Modern mathematical modeling has been applied to mollusk skeletogenesis through both growth and evolutionary history, as seen in studies like Raup and Stanley's work in 1981. Our research explores how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in Prunum, in tandem with experimental studies, can shed light on the processes driving the direction and extent of these changes. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that help model hypothetical and real shell morphologies using the CerioShell software. These models help interpret the possible limits of morphological change in Prunum, combining with experimental and descriptive studies to understand macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be seen as a tube that wraps around over time through 360 degrees of space, with each complete turn called a whorl. These whorls spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The speed and size of whorls can vary, with each whorl separated by a continuous line known as a suture. The largest whorl, the body whorl, is typically the last one. The spire is the part of the shell excluding the body whorl, with the apex at the tip and the base at the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and find the start of the first suture. Draw a line to divide the shell into two parts. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal grows its shell. This movement can be traced using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius. Mathematically representing this trajectory allows for parameter adjustments and modifications to the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Every year, the rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia stays roughly the same, despite notable progress in other areas such as water and sanitation. The country is lagging behind in improving child and maternal health, which threatens to miss its 2015 targets. To understand these issues, a closer look at the health system is needed, rather than focusing solely on specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen a rise in births attended by skilled health workers, now at 72%. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who can't provide medical interventions in case of complications. Moreover, there's been a drop in the number of children under five treated for diarrhea by a health professional, and postnatal care remains a significant concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, around 4%, with urban areas at 7% and rural at a mere 2%. This disparity indicates inequitable access to healthcare services, with urban areas receiving more attention. Additionally, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, highlighting the financial barriers to care for the less privileged.\n\nAs we move forward, the core question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches, or strengthen the overall health system, including pre and post-pregnancy care? Programmatic approaches offer clear objectives and swift results, but they can also lead to funding and resource imbalances, and uncoordinated, duplicated services.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their concentration on the upper class of the era. Two novels, however, are exceptions to this norm: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and the peculiar, deviating from the period's typical fare. This unique approach enhances the characters, offering deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist grapples with the strange events unfolding around him, he is haunted by vivid, dreamlike visions. In one such sequence, he finds himself conversing with Sikes and Crackit, who are in a heated argument. Suddenly, gunshots ring out, and Oliver is thrust into chaos, his senses overwhelmed. Throughout this turmoil, he is plagued by a persistent, undefined pain. This shooting experience leaves Oliver feeling powerless and defeated, unable to control his fate. The fact that he cannot muster the will to save himself, even in the face of imminent danger, suggests that Fagin’s influence has broken him, leaving him to accept this despair. The lack of control Oliver feels is emphasized by his inability to influence the outcome of the shooting, despite his life being at stake.",
            "A few years back, I was working in an after-school program, assisting elementary students with their schoolwork, and my forte was English and reading. It wasn't long before I was recruited to help a young boy named Adrian, a third or fourth grader, who was having trouble reading. The more I worked with him, the more peculiar his reading difficulties became. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others were off by a mile. Despite being of Latino descent and speaking perfect English, Adrian's struggles with reading were puzzling. It wasn't until I met his mother that it all clicked – Adrian could read, he just hadn't mastered the English alphabet. While I'm not sure if my intervention helped him much, I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of the language barrier, especially in California schools. It's not always as clear-cut as we think. A child speaking perfect English can still struggle with reading. Everyone agrees this is an issue, so what can we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple – English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for children with limited English skills, it's much more complex. There's no magic answer. Combining dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is key.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is brilliant. It's not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" While there's fear surrounding this approach, that it's a waste of resources and won't benefit the majority, these fears are unfounded. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. So, how do we achieve this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. However, having bilingual aids or tutors in classrooms makes sense.",
            "From childhood, we're often told there's something greater than ourselves, a force beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school, temple, or look within for answers. Many of us embrace the religions our parents instilled in us, while others reject them, claiming there's nothing beyond our personal universe. We may adopt one belief system only to later change our minds. Regardless of our journey, we strive to define ourselves through our unique perspectives of spirituality, searching for a light in the darkness to guide us to the sun.\n\n\"Cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, rain drumming on the tin roof, and smoked our cigarettes together. Gutters carried the rain, drowning plants along the edge.

            "The classic Gothic Novel is, in essence and name, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" according to Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has faced both criticism and praise, with some labeling it shallow and others marveling at its 'terrible sublime' allure (Burke). The founding text, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, blended old theatrical elements and new novelistic techniques to give birth to the proto-Gothic genre. Walpole's \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4) uses medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, drawing upon the archaic or unsophisticated connotations of the term \"gothic\" in the face of modern societal advancements. The fusion of theatrical Gothic elements with the novel's personal perspective on character psychology is what has kept Gothic literature alive, both antiquated and fresh, for centuries.\n\nOne central theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers as it represents the ideals of bravery, honor, and competence. Walpole, writing during politically tumultuous times, may have felt that the moral goodness of the Gothic era had faded in contemporary society, inspiring him to idealize and romanticize the 'gothic past' through his writing. Characters like Frederic embody this chivalric spirit, described as a prince, a victim of tragedy, and slain by infidels. Frederic's character is exaggerated, embodying the soon-to-be iconic Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the set of processes that move goods from the customer's order to the stage of raw materials, through production, and distribution to the customer. The concept was coined by Keith Oliver in 1982. He described it as the planning, implementation, and control of activities along the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and effectively. Key elements include production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these elements to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nThe first step in this process is production. This is the backbone of the entire supply chain. Production involves deciding when, why, where, and how everything will be made. Managers need to understand customer preferences, which they can gauge through market analysis. By examining the market, they can determine customer demands and decide what products to produce and in what quantities. They also determine the optimal location for production, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. After setting the production location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial, and each detail must be meticulously planned to avoid long-term costs. For instance, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, both of which have detailed processes for every aspect of the business, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. These outlined processes ensure smooth operation and clear expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply. It involves making strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and determining which outsourcing partnerships to pursue. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the best division for each process. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to increase velocity. Velocity refers to providing high-quality, flexible service while reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels.",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country governed by a brutal military junta. In 2007, protests led by Buddhist monks, known as the Saffron Revolution, erupted in the streets. At first, the government permitted monks to gather peacefully, but later, violence escalated, leading to the military's invasion of monasteries and the imprisonment of foreign journalists. The official death toll stands at 13, but a former soldier, Colonel Hla Win, claims many more died.\n\nThis is not a new occurrence.

Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered gods, and our current president, George W. Bush, is rumored to have weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a party affiliate.\n\nNotable examples of such atrocities include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest authoritarian rule, with the death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. And, of course, Hitler's Third Reich saw the systematic persecution and murder of Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington’s enduring influence on jazz can be attributed to his longevity and his unmatched ability to mold his orchestra into a versatile ensemble. His piano playing, while often subtle, serves as the foundation for many of his compositions, which beautifully highlight the individual talents of his band members. As a composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate pieces that allowed for solo improvisation, while also writing highly orchestrated sections that showcased each musician’s unique style. By doing so, he created cohesive and distinct sounds that brought each piece to life. Ellington’s masterful understanding of his players’ sounds and how they blended together in a growing ensemble resulted in some of the most innovative and brilliant recordings in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s innovative use of voice as an instrument throughout his career. His piece Creole Love Call is a notable early example of this, where he used voice to add depth and color without the distraction of lyrics. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each showcasing a different soloist and call and response technique. These choruses illustrate Ellington’s ability to complement the style of his soloists, a skill that permeates his entire career.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his talent for tight orchestration with his keen ear for tone color. He achieves this by using “Bubber” Miley’s muted trumpet call and response with Baby Cox’s scat singing. The interplay between Miley’s vocal elements and Cox’s instrumental voice creates a rich, complementary sound. Ellington’s masterful use of Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone in It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further demonstrates this ability.\n\nEllington’s innovative use of voice to add tone color to his pieces is a recurring stylistic trait that sets his work apart.",
            "She'd always felt a strange emptiness, a yearning for something she couldn't quite put her finger on. It began when she was 14, just entering her teenage years, and persisted despite the passage of three years. At 17, she decided she wanted a relationship, but no one seemed to ignite her interest. She pondered this peculiar situation endlessly, but her contemplation yielded no satisfying answers. Thus, she carried on with life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nAt home, her parents were peaceful and harmonious, their arguments scarce, save for those with their daughter about her independent spirit. She was the lively daughter of calm parents, her personality a vibrant contrast to their peaceful energies. Today, however, tranquility seemed to have fled. As she wandered through the house seeking inspiration, a piercing scream echoed from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, usually so beautiful, was filled with pain. She rushed to the source, her heart pounding. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried. Her mother lay on the floor, groaning, \"Ow.\" Her daughter rushed to her side, putting a hand on her, \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the - hospital.\" Her words were rushed, and her pain evident. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where,\" she said, grateful for the strength she'd gained from her training. She carefully carried her mother to the car and drove to the hospital, the scent of disinfectant and fear filling her nostrils. She rushed her mother inside, calling for help. Concerned faces gathered, and her mother was quickly taken away to be examined. She was left to wait, herheart heavy with worry.\n\nHer mother had climbed a ladder to reach a vase from the highest cabinet, but the step stool toppled, sending her crashing to the ground.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) diet score, is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower risk of stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a variation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious research has shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also discovered that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without prior CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) to assess nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses remained throughout the entire study period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. If records were unavailable, cases were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for confounding factors (which could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe study found that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile were at a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States endured a devastating financial calamity. The unemployment rate soared, the housing market imploded, and many of America's most influential businesses were left in shambles. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting us to examine how it came to pass and how we might prevent a recurrence. Simply put, the crisis was cultivated by shortsighted political decisions that compelled banks and corporations to disburse sub-prime loans to an already perilous financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into CDO's and CDS's. When borrowers defaulted, banks were left with depleted capital reserves and passed the resulting chaos on to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were sown in 1999 during the Clinton administration. President Clinton, seeking a second term, eased lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move ultimately prepared the ground for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times observed in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, has been increasingly pressured by the Clinton Administration to expand loans to low and moderate-income individuals and has faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As elaborated upon, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would inevitably result in the economy's collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic freefall, one of which was the innovative mortgage structure. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO's) were extensively utilized in the years preceding the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This overleveraging left both U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, and the financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left in ruins. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, which constituted about 30% of the USA's GDP. As a result, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold off at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to operate as commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your tale where you attempt to take flight, captivating your audience with your spellbinding words, or the section where your readers nod off and hit the \"Back\" button, muttering your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of it, feeling like she's been trapped in a never-ending monologue.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the fundamental writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into stretches of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder whispering, \"Get the boring parts out of the way to reach the good stuff\" (not to be confused with the other devil on your shoulder, urging you to tell your audience every detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition means sharing the details of what happened in simple prose. In movies, exposition occurs when one character dumps information onto another, like in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific place and time, that they married in a grand style, and that her husband was killed in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with both of them speaking only a few lines. You'd expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he loves his wife. You'd also expect the heroine to reveal her feelings for him in subtle ways, reflecting how his presence in her life has changed and enriched her (especially if the story later reveals this explicitly). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally invested in his fate and the heroine's character: you'd learn what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect substance behind the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to add that meat. (*looks at the metaphor, sighs, presses on*) Sometimes it's tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, now he's the night manager of a gas station, he's been married twice, has no kids, likes to fish on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live NBC 4 report from this morning (August 13, 2011), featured a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. His mugshot showed a face that seemed to epitomize evil, and he received a mere two minutes of coverage. The story was relatively brief, but I thought the time given was appropriate.\nThe second story concerned the shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old man in the Sharon Woods area. He had been critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was conducting an investigation. This story seemed brief, which I believe was due to the victim being a minority. I've noticed this tendency for years; if a white person is a crime victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, it barely gets a mention.\nThe third story was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators believe it was caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\nThe fourth story was about Saturday's predicted rain and thunderstorms. They mentioned the weekend's mid to low 80°F temperatures, but the report was quite short, serving as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\nAnother story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. The amount of time the reporter spent emphasizing his race seemed unusual.\nLastly, they reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. I found it curious that they mentioned his Hispanic heritage, as it didn't seem relevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection as deep and intricate as the roots of an ancient tree. In this bond, emotions dance and clash, a symphony of love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, all bound together in an unspoken understanding. Brothers see in each other a reflection of themselves, a truth that is harder to accept than any other. It is in the darkest moments, when the storms of emotion rage, that this bond reveals its true power. The price of understanding the emotions that flow from this fraternal bond is high, for it demands we confront the consequences that come with them. Seeing the truth in another's eyes, we see ourselves not as others see us, but as we truly are. Our actions and their consequences bare our character for all to see. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme, and the complex emotions it brings. Through a landscape vividly described, these boys embark on a journey that leads to a dramatic conclusion. The protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together, to their final, tragic encounter, he feels resentment towards Doodle. He desired a brother he could teach and bond with, someone to share his adventures with, but Doodle's frail heart made that impossible. His dreams were shattered, and he even contemplated harming his brother. Yet, when Doodle smiled at him, his heart softened. This emotional rollercoaster shows that, despite his intentions, he had an innate love for his brother. The narrator's perspective also highlights the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, both of which greatly influence his actions.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing apparatus. As technology evolved from primitive to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll of papyrus, next to a book, and most recently to a computer. When exploring brain science, remember that these metaphors only go so far and can lead to false conclusions. Information's journey begins with the sensory organs, converting physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when looking at a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and object borders to identify it as a box. Top-down processing aids in this recognition, helping you recognize it as a black box rather than a hole. Once processed, an attention filter determines the signal's importance and its access to cognitive processes. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter keeps you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you notice your name spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, each modulated by attention. To process information, it must first be stored in different types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded in specific ways for each sensory stimulus; verbal input, for example, can be encoded by its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest working memory, which holds information briefly, is maintained by a looping electrical signal in specific neurons. Long-term memory information is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins. There are various models of knowledge organization in the brain, ranging from human memory retrieval to computer science to neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that knowledge is organized into nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stance against the impending dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. The story unfolds in a dystopian future where people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to chase immediate happiness. The citizens, in reality, are mere pawns in a grand scheme controlled by the World Controller. Marxist ideology shines through in this critique, as the author expresses concerns about the development of these systems. Key Marxist concepts like homogenization and reification highlight the faults of the emerging capitalist economy from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is skewered through the lens of false consciousness, a Marxist idea where the common people are kept unaware of true economic relations. This is evident in Brave New World where people are more interested in personal gain than understanding their place in the economic system. The conditioning through hypnopædia drives the populace to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony is clear here, with the lower classes dominated by the ruling class, unaware of their manipulation. The upper classes, like Alphas or Betas, accept their role, with few characters like Bernard questioning their place. The superficial interactions and lack of depth among characters suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism segregates individuals, stripping them of free will and expression. Love and deep emotions are absent, with interactions reduced to discussions about physical appearances. This reflects the societal complacency and obedience to the capitalist hierarchy. In essence, Brave New World uses capitalism's socioeconomic effects to showcase the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who believe they are superior as long as they consume, obey, and blend in with their peers.",
            "I've been a University Park student for nearly three years, which equates to a little over four semesters. Navigating the campus can be a real challenge for many, including myself. My first year, I was placed in an East Halls dorm room, as far east as you can get without counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes like those in the Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially on bad weather days, which are frequent in State College. An alum, not much older than myself, shared that not long ago, East Halls were separated from the rest of the school by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that space has been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and the surrounding apartments. As our campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. The solution? Bicycles. But bikes alone won’t solve the problem; they must be used, and the campus must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI recently discussed this with a friend who started cycling again after a long break. He said, \"Bikes are great. For a few years, it wasn’t cool to ride one, but it’s the only way to get around.\" Apart from being great for your body, cycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you over 30 miles. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, equally distant from the center of campus as some dorms. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I attend class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes. The only snag is Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, which isn’t always the easiest to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. While walking has its advantages, I’m too busy to do it. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option for class. Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, which totals over two and a half hours each week. I’d have even more time to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on, which is time I can’t afford to spare."
