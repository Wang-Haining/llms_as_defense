            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

These values resonate deeply with my personal beliefs.\n\nI've always harbored a desire to assist others, but the specific career path eluded me through high school and college. Many individuals evaded their problems through denial, while others resorted to less-than-healthy coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations solidified my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Post-graduation, I took a break from the academic world. One summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a troubled teenager. He was escaping his abusive parents, and the next day, he involved the police. I drove to his parents' house to offer help, and though the law couldn't intervene, I spoke with his parents. They were defensive and blamed his “manipulative” behavior for involving outsiders. This encounter sparked my interest in social work, seeing it as a way to help children navigate family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another core value in this field. Our society claims to value individuality but often follows archaic traditions, making it challenging to be truly unique. I've protested against this contradiction throughout my education.

            "The following paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to insomnia. The Biological model centers on genetic inheritance and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review explores these models through a selection of research studies, explaining each and critiquing their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Hypersomnia, deal with initiating or maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder affect sleep behavior. The following review zeroes in on insomnia and its relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice showed that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons control sleep and wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety. A study found that the GABAB agonist (baclofen) significantly increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This indicates that animal models can be applied to human studies, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for human sleep regulation. A dysfunction in this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, altered receptors would naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting daily life, including school, work, and monotonous tasks that require focus.",
            "This article explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It begins by defining the disorder, then outlines how it’s diagnosed, including common signs or “red flags,” and finally suggests ways educators can support students with CAPD in a mainstream classroom setting.\n\nCAPD, or APD, is essentially how well our central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. The brain struggles to interpret sounds, even though hearing is normal. Those affected can't distinguish words, separate conversation from background noise, or recognize sound patterns. They might miss sarcasm or have difficulties with sound sequences.\n\nCAPD was first recognized in the mid-1950s, initially called “auditory imperception.” Italian researchers led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for affected children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and a model for explaining how the brain processes these sounds. A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include: not being able to locate sounds, having trouble distinguishing between sounds, missing sound patterns, misunderstanding speech changes, and difficulties with sound sequences. Diagnosis involves screening using various tools, as there’s no single diagnostic test. This might include questionnaires, observations, and tests that present multiple simultaneous sounds.\n\nMany educators may wonder how to assist students with CAPD in a mainstream classroom. The article offers suggestions for creating an inclusive learning environment, such as simplifying instructions, reducing background noise, and providing visual aids to support auditory information.",

            "German colonial rule has been widely criticized for its harshness, most notably in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. However, it's important to remember that an empire as vast as the German colonial empire couldn't be understood through such a simple lens. It was characterized by a wide range of policies and ruling styles, reflected in its educational systems. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they found a sizeable educated and literate African population. Similar praise was given to German educational efforts in colonies like Kamerun. In stark contrast, South West Africa (now Namibia) saw a completely different reality. The German government left the task of educating the natives almost entirely to mission societies with limited support, while they invested heavily in European education, establishing state schools and regulating mission schools. This had lasting effects, leaving the majority of the population uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There's a considerable body of literature on German colonial education, much of it in German and written post-1900. Early works focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies, while later English works expanded the discourse through comparative studies and detailed analyses. Cohen's study, for example, compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing many of the differences to the large settler population in South West Africa. Unlike Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a moderate climate, but a significant portion of the territory was desert. This influenced the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living there by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past 100 years has led to a massive array of genres, making it challenging to list them all. The sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within these genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have multiplied, with Heavy Metal rock becoming notably diverse and expressive in the past 40 years. This genre's flexibility has inspired numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, creating a labyrinth of niches that define it today. The boundaries between what is considered Heavy Metal are blurred, incorporating themes from other genres. To grasp the current metal music landscape, one must first understand the movement's origins and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is often characterized by its \"more\" philosophy—more bass, volume, violence, theatricality, and technical prowess. Musicians in metal bands are skilled and proficient, which resonates in their music's complexity. It has also been a movement heavily influenced by psychedelic drug culture, with the mid-70s boom leading to experimental, otherworldly records. The dark, visceral qualities of metal were innovative at the time, as most popular music lacked this emotional depth. Later generations of metal artists have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark themes. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' Helter Skelter exemplify this darkness, showcasing the genre's heavier, darker side. This song is often considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, a response to a Rolling Stones song, as the Beatles sought to prove they could match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Years before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was meticulously weaving his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist, captures not just a woman marveling at the wonders of her dream land, but also Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. From the start, he harbored a longing for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. However, he found himself grappling with a challenging internal conflict: should he conform to or mimic certain styles to be accepted by the critical art world he admired, or should he forge his own independent path?\n\nTo truly understand The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in the northwest French town of Laval, Rousseau's father was a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Growing up, he received no formal art education and worked for France as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname douanier, or customs inspector. The passing of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only one daughter, Julia, and profound grief. Hence, he turned to painting for solace and new beginnings, unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized and sentimentalized peasants in their art. Rousseau was essentially a folk painter and mirrored the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with gaining acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable given his context: he was uneducated in fine arts and began his career late in life, producing art alongside well-known, talented contemporaries. Remarkably, he didn't receive proper recognition until around the same time Matisse was rising to fame. In Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse and Rousseau were competitors, they differed in style, subject matter, and their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting tritely, while Rousseau desired to paint so conventionally that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have posited a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason for this. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn much in life through education or experience, yet we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics seemingly without instruction. Both fields strive to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than prescribing rules. For instance, discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might explore elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully capture why it's good art. Instead, when asked about a favorite piece, we often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before diving into more complex explanations. Both art and morality can't be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" Likewise, ethics has this same quality, as Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I believe this intangible essence, this \"je ne sais quoi,\" is art and morality's most powerful attribute, linking them deeply. We experience both morality and art most powerfully at a noumenal level, as Kant might put it—impacting us in ways that can be felt but not fully explained. This is especially true in literature, as McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" We value literature precisely because it reflects the values we hold in life.",
            "Germany today stands as a powerful, unified country, blending its unique culture from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This cultural mosaic stretches from Cologne, along the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, and up to the Elbe's banks in the Saxon city of Dresden. It's no surprise, then, that modern Germany is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name whose origins are debated by scholars. Some argue it came from the Germanic tribe called Tungrians, or from the Old Irish word 'garim' meaning 'to shout,' indicating the Germans' loud nature. Tacitus, a Roman historian, wrote in AD 98 that the Germans were aboriginals who did not mix with other races. He also noted that those who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy or Germany would do so only if it were their home. Similarly, Romans ventured into Germania for goods and services, but seldom stayed, leaving it to the Germanic tribes who lived on the empire's borders.\n\nNow",
            "I stood gazing at the scene before me, my mind void of any thoughts, passively observing the view without engaging it. I had been trained to study my surroundings with an unemotional detachment, to analyze them without connecting them to any abstract concepts. My thoughts came and went as swiftly as the objects in my field of vision. It felt as though I was not thinking at all, just experiencing what lay before me in a smooth, fluid state.\n\nYears ago, an artist I worked with recommended to me a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn to draw and this book promised to teach everything from understanding a pencil to the brain's interpretation of lines. One of its techniques was to frame any picture you want to study with a square, turning an overly detailed scene into a simplified one.\n\nAs I stared at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't impose an artist's frame on it. I was too overwhelmed by the beauty and complexity of the scene. I felt like I was looking at the beginnings of a grand piece of art, a masterpiece in the making. The first brushstroke, the first stroke of a master's brush, so to speak.\n\nMy fingers touched the brush, my hand moving through space, translating my will into action. The water in the bowl was clear and still, reflecting the light, the flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. My hand, now more anxious and restless, hit the brush against the toilet again, but the stubborn brown package refused to budge, stuck to the bottom like a slug.\n\nI held the mop loosely in my hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie knotted tightly around my neck. I frowned as I looked at the offending package, a message left by a careless cleaner. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, and then I grabbed the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it formed an oven mitt. I stood up straight, then bent over, my hand slowly dipping into the bowl, like a mother reaching for the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven...",
            "Every day, our roads are claiming young lives due to a perfect storm of inexperience and adolescent inclination to take risks. The National Institutes of Health tell us that the teen brain isn't fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving, and simple inexperience leads to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road incidents. Peer pressure exacerbates this, with teens often driving with friends, as anyone who's ever been young knows. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the more passengers a teen has, the higher the risk of accidents.\n\nStates have tried to curb teen driving fatalities by introducing temporary provisional licenses limiting driving hours and preventing other minors as passengers. However, these are mere band-aids. The real issue is that, as a group, teens are statistically ill-equipped to handle driving's risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes 18 is too young for a regular license. USA Today reports his research shows teens under 19-20 crave thrills, making it logical to delay driving until this urge diminishes. If we continue to license young teens, deaths will likely surge, especially with millions of Baby Boomer's children becoming eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nSimplifying the law would involve maintaining driver's education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could drive without a full license. A provisional permit could still be issued, requiring a set number of practical training hours, likely based on current state requirements. A national, uniform law would protect teens across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not unprecedented.",
            "As I delved into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My study mainly focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and analyzing the unique traits of a few later ones. Trick films around the turn of the century were generally confined to a single set within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the rule that one shot equals one film. However, some early 20th-century films dared to break these rules by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne striking aspect that trick films share is their filming in a set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary to capture figures or objects, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville traditions. This often constrains characters to move side-to-side within the frame, rather than towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, without the camera following them.\n\nShots in trick films tend to be long and medium, with close-ups never used. This comes from the theatre tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at once. Actors rarely move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent. Most early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the dramatic usage of trick films, focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single shot may actually be several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearance. Carefully examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) to see how the \"physical shot\" of Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, despite the film's conceptual unity as a single shot.",
            "John Taylor, from Caroline, was an early and passionate believer in Republicanism. His primary occupation as an agriculturalist, along with his brief political career, shaped him into a strong advocate for personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system underpinned his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system, free from established traditions that could hinder the creation of a self-governing society. He held firm beliefs in natural rights, considering them interdependent and beyond the reach of government. He argued that physical prowess and malevolent intelligence should not dictate society's rules, unlike in a state of nature.\n\nTo cultivate this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government acknowledging both the good and evil inherent in man. He believed in a dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on such principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a government with no additional rights or powers beyond what was explicitly stated, fearing an extensive Federal government could become despotic. However, he also cautioned against a strict, literal interpretation, as it could become corrupt without considering the intent of the writers. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, more explicitly describing it as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. The reason behind this dip is unclear, although it coincides with the onset of winter in New England, which typically leads to fewer bicycle and foot commuters. The end of the fall semester, with its rush of final exams and grade processing, could also have contributed to the decline. The holiday season brings a month-long break in December, during which many do not need to come to campus. January's delayed resumption of classes may also be a factor. The low submission numbers in February, however, remain unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project could have waned naturally. To reinvigorate participation, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that resulted in a spike in log submissions. This project faced challenges in maintaining momentum due to holiday breaks and semester schedules, as well as the deeply ingrained preference for driving that characterizes our culture. We offered various prizes to encourage alternative commuting modes. These included gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a bookstore, and even national chain stores. To potentially boost participation further, larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars could have been considered. If the value of the prizes were to increase over time, this might have also helped. Initially, our gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing a bicycle giveaway in December and a hybrid/electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than decrease it.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility and stock-like trading on an exchange. It offers the diversification of an index fund along with the advantages of single stock ownership, such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. While these benefits are highly attractive, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks too, like the need to pay a commission on trades, just as you would with stock orders. Additionally, ETFs come in a wide variety of funds, but savvy investors should evaluate whether these stated benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent. For this analysis, we will examine the IHF ETF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF offers benefits close to those of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could yield a higher Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo keep the analysis manageable, we've decided to include only the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of all assets in the ETF. Below is a list of these top 10 holdings and their respective percentage of total assets.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the IHF ETF as a whole, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and return, using the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%. The calculations for Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio made up of the top 10 holdings would generate a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it's important to note that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-Land,\" one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed finer poems, employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott traces this reference to Virgil, who used it to describe an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, there's a more contemporary connection to consider. Poe was fascinated by German literature, particularly the works of Goethe.\n\nThis reference is crucial as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt notes the similarity between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" concluding that Poe was likely imitating the latter. \"Faust,\" a celebrated poetic drama by Goethe, was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. The second part contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells of a king who loses his wife and subsequently his life over his grief and drinking.\n\nPoe incorporates \"Thulé\" twice in his works. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs it as a framing device for the entire poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thulé as dark, lonely, and haunted by the ghosts of friends, reminiscent of the fate of the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem. The entire poem seems to be a reflection of stepping into Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe, a significant author, would have been known to Poe not only for his respect for Tennyson but also due to the numerous reproductions of his works circulating after his death.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, resulting in injury, be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed of the spill twice and failed to clean it up for a half-hour because he was dining? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To seek such damages, Palmer must show that the defendant's actions were willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm, as well as that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the spill's potential harm, considering multiple previous incidents, and that his failure to act was despicable given the ongoing safety issues. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed manager Paul Martin about the spill, and he responded he was on dinner break. Another employee notified him at 5:15 pm, to no avail. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is suing for damages, and we are considering a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Courts have defined malicious conduct as knowing the probable harm and willfully failing to avoid it.

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the most contentious topics of discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that this question has become even more pertinent today. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I’ve noticed a shift in the mass media’s portrayal of Islam and extremists, ranging from a hostile view to an extreme form of tolerance in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have imagined a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet is fascinating to me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, it contradicts his personality. From what I’ve learned in the past, I thought Muhammad was a forceful figure who would conquer tribes and force them to convert to Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr who was misunderstood and humbled himself to others, leading people to see the ‘truth’ in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between Jesus’ ministries and the ‘miracles’ attributed to Muhammad. The most notable example is when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of writing makes me believe the authors wanted Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet who didn’t need to prove anything, simply living in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is particularly concerning because it diminishes the miracle and life of Jesus Christ, as if they are trying to appropriate Jesus’ life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography seem to serve an agenda of providing proof of ‘witnesses’ or of how people converted to Islam ‘on their own.’ However, many of these stories are third-party accounts, with the author claiming to have heard them from others, who heard from others, and so on. This approach makes the stories seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical records contradict the idea of Muhammad being a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they were during his lifetime, were quickly swept aside in the evolution of Christian thought that followed. If we paint a broad picture of this history, we see a trend of Christianity moving steadily away from its roots. Today, we witness an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people persist and may resist new thinking, their influence may not be significant enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, there is a growing historical awareness, a yearning to distinguish the doctrines that were incorporated over time from the original intent of the religion's namesake. This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a great reversal in the trend of Christian history, a progression back to its original form. A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock is moving backward, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to humanity remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if living during Jesus' time, the church will remain robust, guiding the way. However, with the theological clock moving backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. We will see less difference and more similarity among regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind. Throughout history, great reversals have occurred. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became Christianized. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the Christian religion, undoing history to find the source and reducing diversity in the process. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. Then, what happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look back far enough in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the notion of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core of the religion. However, the Jewish population was not united; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle exposes the inherent greed and self-centeredness of human nature, demonstrating that people are driven to improve their own lives without considering others, especially those less fortunate. The novel illustrates this through the actions of factory owners and managers, who prioritize their own wealth and success over any cost to workers or the environment. According to Upton Sinclair, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" depicting the immense pollution caused by these factories. The owners show no remorse for the people or animals harmed by this pollution, including the thousands of pens filled with animal waste.\n\nThe owners also exploit their employees, forcing them to work grueling hours and providing little compensation. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers face layoffs without notice, leaving them without jobs and assistance. The lack of laws or regulations to protect workers allowed managers and owners to operate with impunity, pushing employees to work in horrific conditions. The novel suggests that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh living and working conditions. There were no agencies to aid these workers, and unions often caused more harm than good, lining their own pockets rather than helping the workers. The workers were effectively slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes toward crucial subjects. Some of these methods are more successful than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a multitude of these strategies in his novel The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, he links an adjective with a noun that doesn't typically pair to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he imparts meaning to a symbol and then uses it for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently uses the latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up associations for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later employs to remind readers of specific feelings related to important objects.\n\nFitzgerald imbues white/gray with a sense of uniformity, with white signifying a refined, high-class image and gray representing something older and faded. He introduces this meaning in the beginning of the novel through recurrent use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently “in white” (8), and everyone at Gatsby’s party wears white: Nick in “white flannels” (41), Tom in a “white shirt” (36), and Catherine “powdered milky white” (30). The only time people aren’t in white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by using them to paint common, unimportant subjects: Nick commutes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are “gray names” (61) on Nick’s schedule, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), and he describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs white/gray to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects, starting with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to emphasize her uniformity, such as the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18) and her appearance in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",

            "Culture, in essence, is a complex tapestry. It's not merely what it appears to be, but also what it isn't, and what it symbolizes. Culture isn't something uniform or singular, like a specific thing. Generalizations about cultures, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are often too broad and simplistic. While acknowledging a culture's general traits is useful, it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the significance of that culture to the situation and how it might influence the negotiation table. When interacting with a foreign culture, one naturally relates it to their own, leading to comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or altering a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its guidelines, especially when negotiating from a weaker position or on foreign turf. Acknowledging traditions and beliefs can help navigate cultural barriers and propel the negotiation forward. Remember, culture isn't confined to national or international borders—most companies within a country develop their own corporate cultures. For instance, some may prioritize long office hours, while others might favor a more relaxed schedule. These nuances can be observed in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same societal culture, there can be vast differences from company to company, or even between regions. Values are particularly crucial to understand, as they provide the underlying reasons for a culture's behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony are valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly shaming their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, if a culture emphasizes a hard-driven bargain, a negotiator won't rush to settle. While these general insights are helpful, it's also wise to learn more about the opponent's personal background to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool, in his hubris, argues that there is no God. St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two figures of considerable theological influence, both challenge this notion, each offering their own arguments to prove the existence of the Biblical God. To evaluate their arguments, we must first acknowledge their shared belief in God, as their respective defenses of this concept are the focus of our inquiry. Any deviation from this specific God would render their arguments incomparable. With this in mind, let us explore their arguments. St. Anselm's argument revolves around the notion that God's existence can be understood through faith and introspection. He posits that God is inherently part of our understanding, making the concept of God's nonexistence inconceivable. This idea, while complex and sometimes unclear, suggests that the proof of God lies within our own minds, eliminating the need for external evidence. This is a central tenet of Christian belief, often referred to as faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, posits that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, without the need for faith. Such an approach would be advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of new converts based on logical persuasion rather than faith alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments in support of his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates the logical necessity for God's existence. If one piece of a puzzle were missing, logical deduction would allow us to understand and prove its existence without physically seeing it.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism—the most traditional form of which is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now about twenty-five hundred years old, has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This change can be observed today, for example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople participate in this event, which, despite Buddha never teaching about it, holds great religious significance. Such differences extend from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the perspective of monks and laypeople, has adapted its doctrinal principles over time due to both internal and external influences, ranging from hostile to benign.\n\nVarious terms are crucial to this discussion. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces negatively impact the Buddhist community, often stemming from misperceptions of Buddhism, while benign forces, though not necessarily intending to help or harm, may still influence the community. These terms will be frequently used throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, we must explore the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is composed of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of all things. Recognizing these concepts allows one to break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which ends the trio of attachments: lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules of life, with five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicants) and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrine is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and the path to the end of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States emerged victorious and acquired Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. There were numerous other conflicts between the two nations, which finally eased up just before the First World War. Like many other nations, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico began due to clashes over religious, cultural, and traditional differences, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not uncommon among nations sharing a border, as the proximity often leads to rivalries over shared territory. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41), as these nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations that have maintained good relations with the U.S. Religious issues created a divide between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). The rivalry was part ideological struggle and part competition over vital interests, not based on political structure but on religious preferences. This distrust dated back to the animosity between the English and Spanish, making amicable foreign relations difficult. Diehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this rivalry period, with most involving territorial issues such as border raids and frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American towns into Mexican territory were a persistent issue until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). The rivalry began to ease as Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the late 19th century (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, illness struck suddenly and without warning, leaving me disabled and unprepared. I was a nurse at the time, drawn to the profession due to a deep-seated need for the stability and security it promised. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" was the refrain I heard as I grew older. So, even though my heart yearned for science or journalism, I chose nursing. Yet, here I was: forty-six, single, penniless, and unable to work. For fifteen years, Social Security Disability has been my lifeline, but it has left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a battle for security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, yet one thing is clear: I would not have survived these years without the support of my family and a few steadfast friends.\n\nLife is filled with emergencies, big and small. Some challenges are too great to face alone, no matter how well we prepare. I strongly believe we should stop relying solely on large government systems that are failing. Instead, let's foster a culture of mutual trust and assistance, where we learn to help each other and ask for help when needed.\n\nConservatives often talk about the rugged individualism that built this country, but it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources that sustained our forefathers in tough times. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone; they relied on each other.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have emergency supplies, from first-aid kits to canned goods and water purifying tablets. I have flashlights, candles, and matches. If you have the means, consider growing your own food or installing a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you prepare, don't forget to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms adapt and evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the course of evolutionary change? While D’Arcy Thompson asserted in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same uncertainty persists today. However, recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can reveal the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that form the basis for modeling hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that traverses through 360 degrees of space over time, with each revolution or turn of a coiled shell called a whorl. These whorls move around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The enlargement rate of whorls can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl, and the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the base is the opposite end. The animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation of a shell is an apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upward.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are then counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a progression of apertures through both time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to influence the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "In Indonesia, the neonatal and infant mortality rate has barely budged over the past decade, despite the country's progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets. While strides have been made in child and maternal health, we're still far behind the goal posts for 2015. Let's delve into the reasons why and consider what needs to be beefed up: our health system, perhaps, rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile we've seen a boost in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, reaching 72%, the picture isn't entirely rosy. Traditional midwives, who can't provide advanced medical care, make up a chunk of this number, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate from conditions like hemorrhage. The uptick in births attended isn't the full story here. We've also seen a dip in the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Postnatal care data is sketchy, but it's clear that it's a concern nationwide, with low rates across the board.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still subpar at 4%, with a stark urban-rural divide. Urban areas boast a 7% rate, while rural areas lag at 2%. This underscores the inequity in healthcare access, which is heavily skewed towards urban areas. Furthermore, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, highlighting the struggle for the poor to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, as we ponder how to improve neonatal and maternal care, we must ask: should we prioritize developing targeted programs or bolstering the overall health system? Program-specific approaches are tempting. They offer clear, manageable objectives and can yield quicker results. However, they can also lead to funding and resource imbalances, with certain areas, like HIV/AIDS, receiving disproportionate attention. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to service duplication and an overwhelming amount of paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature often showcases meticulous attention to detail and an emphasis on the upper classes. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, typical of the period. These unusual aspects contribute to the characters' development, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n\nThese novels often use mystery and dreamlike states to convey their themes, with each approach differing. For instance, in Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences reveal his inner turmoil, the things that trouble him, and his understanding of the world around him. When Oliver revisits the shooting in chapter 28, he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, his dire health situation, and the constant fear and despair that haunt him. The shooting highlights Oliver's helplessness to effect any change, even during life-threatening situations. It suggests that he has little control over his circumstances, reinforced by the sense of defeat and resignation as if old Fagin has broken him.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years back, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged kids. While I could help them with various subjects, my strengths were in English and reading. I was asked to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. His difficulties were peculiar; he could pronounce certain letters correctly while others were a mystery. He spoke perfect English but was having trouble with the English alphabet. It wasn't until I met his mom that I understood the issue; Adrian could read, but he didn't know the alphabet well. I hope he's improved now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, especially in California. Even a kid who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. This problem is evident, and solutions aren't straightforward. In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations, helped. But for kids who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no single answer. Combining all approaches—dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—is the key to addressing this issue.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is beneficial. Not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for all. Studies show that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. However, fear and misconceptions surround this idea, such as it being a resource drain or unhelpful for the majority. But that's not true. If implemented as the norm, all children would benefit. How do we achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? Not necessarily. It's more practical to have bilingual aids or tutors to support these programs.",
            "From the moment we are little, many of us are told there's something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully grasp. Some of us attend Sunday school, others visit temples, or delve within ourselves for answers. Many readily embrace the faith passed down by our parents, but some reject it entirely, dismissing the possibility of anything beyond our personal realities. Still, we all journey to define pieces of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a beacon in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to the rain's relentless drumming on the tin roof above while we smoked. The gutters channeled the rain, drenching the plants along the porch's edge. He stared out into the storm, his eyes half lost in thought, half recalling memories. His once sturdy frame now seemed frail, his clothes loose and shapeless. His hair, thinned, fails to hide the signs of the illness. He gazed out into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt alone, afraid, and silenced by my fear of discussing the inevitable. I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and joined him in watching the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away five days after my twenty-second birthday, in December of that year. The treatments had not lessened his suffering but prolonged it, keeping him alive a few more months than expected. The purpose of his prolonged suffering was unclear to me. The thought of a God who would allow this crossed my mind. I found no solace in prayer that night. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening long ago.\n\nI declined to witness his passing into another realm. I couldn't bear to watch the life that formed me fade away. I chose to remember him through the life he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone, better than his own family. I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in my bed for three days, awaiting the news, only to find that no one called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt puts it, is a paradoxical blend of \"old\" and \"new,\" both in name and substance, in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both lauded and criticized, praised for its 'terrible sublime' and accused of lacking depth. The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements of ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new form of literary expression. Walpole combined old theatrical elements with new naturalistic mimicry in modern novels, labeling it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic novels often hark back to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, seen as archaic or unsophisticated. The fusion of the more theatrical Gothic and the novel's personal perspective is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers far removed from the original era.\n\nA prominent Gothic theme is the concept of Chivalry. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retained and transformed the medieval idea of chivalry. Chivalry, representing the ideal knight, was appealing to Gothic writers because of the lack of that ideal in contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" was idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in his characters, particularly Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, being described as a brave and courteous knight, even if exaggeratedly so (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of operations that transforms customer orders into finished products and delivers them. This concept was introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982 and encompasses planning, implementing, and guiding the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. The six critical components of a supply chain are production, sourcing, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business leaders utilize these elements to deliver superior customer service. Production is the cornerstone of the supply chain, involving the who, what, when, where, and how of making products. Managers must understand market demands to make informed decisions. By examining the market, managers can discern customer preferences and determine which products to produce and in what quantities. After deciding what to produce, managers must choose the optimal production location based on volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Following this, they focus on scheduling production and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial for the supply chain; each detail must be meticulously planned to avoid future costs in time and money. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where each aspect of the business had a detailed plan, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Well-defined processes ensure smooth operations and clear expectations. The second key element in supply chain management is sourcing. This involves strategic decisions about core facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the best-fitting division for each product process. Outsourcing can be employed to enhance velocity, which refers to providing quality and flexibility while minimizing costs.",
            "Every day I walk down the streets of Burma, I am greeted by a haunting sign. It reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" scrawled in black Sharpie on a cardboard held by Ellen Page, the actress from Juno. Burma, or Myanmar as it is officially known, is a country in Southeastern Asia ruled by a stern military junta that seized power in 1962. In 2007, a series of public protests erupted, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" led by monks dressed in their saffron robes. The government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the violence escalated, and the military openly attacked monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested, and one Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed during a street protest in September of 2007. While the official death toll stands at 13, some suggest the real number could be in the thousands.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, many governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors are considered gods. In our own time, our president, George W. Bush, reportedly holds weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nOther notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest authoritarian rule, resulting in a death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000 people. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. And let’s not forget Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" a period of widespread atrocities against Jews and others.",
            "Every time I listen to Duke Ellington’s music, I marvel at his enduring impact on jazz. This longevity is largely due to his mastery of his orchestra, orchestrating complex pieces that highlight each band member’s unique talents. Ellington’s compositions often feature subtle piano interplay, yet he excelled in creating rich, intricate arrangements that allowed soloists to freely improvise while maintaining a cohesive sound.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, as seen in Creole Love Call. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece uses call and response between voice and reeds to add layers of texture and color. The voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound. The muted trumpet and clarinet solos elaborate on the melody, while the full band echoes the first chorus. The climactic chorus features a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time. The final chorus returns to the original structure, with the voice taking on a “growl” technique. A brief tag ends with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone novelty.\n\nThis use of voice to enhance tone color is a signature of Ellington’s style. In Hot and Bothered, he combines tight orchestration with tone color, using Bubber Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing to create a complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) showcases Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone in a similar fashion.",
            "She had always felt an insatiable yearning for something, a need that couldn't be satisfied. This longing began when she was 14, entering her teenage years, and it persisted at 17. While she'd defined her desire as someone rather than something, she'd found no interest in boys. Some had tried to woo her, but she remained untouched. She often questioned herself, trying to deduce the cause of her indifference. Years of contemplation offered theories, but no conclusive answers. Therefore, she lived life, always questioning her desires.\n\nA normal day at home was usually peaceful, with parents who rarely argued and a daughter who was both lively and lovable. Today, however, was anything but normal. As she searched for inspiration in her own life, a scream from the kitchen startled her. She rushed in to find her mother on the floor, in obvious pain. \"Mom? What happened?\" she asked, helping her mother up. \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. With her mother's guidance, she carried her to the car, driven by an urge to help. At the hospital, the scent of disinfectant and fear filled the air, but her mind was focused on her mother. The doctors took her, and she was left to wait in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower likelihood of stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a version of the Med diet, featuring increased consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (versus saturated fats), and fish, while lowering intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious research has shown an inverse correlation between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial also found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, prior studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis research followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study—a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. More than 95% of nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation checks. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from the two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal CHD and strokes) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America experienced a severe financial collapse. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market plummeted, and many of America’s biggest corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, raising the question: how did this crisis happen, and how can we prevent it in the future? Simply put, the financial crisis was born from self-centered and naïve political choices that pushed banks and companies into issuing sub-prime loans to an already underprepared and weak financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks found themselves lacking capital reserves and passed this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration in 1999. Aiming for a second term, President Clinton sought to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions, which laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, has faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgages for low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences, stating, “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government rescue like the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foretold, reckless lending would indeed bring about economic disaster.\nMany factors combined to send the economy into a tailspin. One key factor was the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used leading up to the crisis, further entangling the economy in the housing market. This excessive use of leverage in the housing market made U.S. households and financial markets highly vulnerable to even slight price changes.\nThe housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities high and dry. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a combined $4.1 trillion of mortgage debt in 2007, an astounding 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, holding $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where you either soar to new heights with your captivating prose or plunge into the depths of your readers' patience. Dr. Merlin has been known to shudder at her keyboard when she finds herself wading through a swamp of unnecessary details, especially when it's not in the thrilling way. Exposition, it seems, is not your friend.\n\nYou've surely heard the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" but even Dr. Merlin trips into long stretches of unengaging text. Exposition is that sneaky little voice on your shoulder whispering, \"Get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the action (not to be confused with the voice on the other shoulder urging you to reveal every last detail of every character's life).\"\n\nExposition means telling your audience what happened, often in simple, straightforward prose. In a film, it might be when one character shares a history with another like the Ancient Mariner. In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example. Picture a story where you're told that a heroine and her love met at a certain place and time, married in a grand ceremony, and tragically, her husband was murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this tale to stretch over two pages, during which both characters only utter a few lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his deep love for his wife through his speech and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to demonstrate her attachment to him in subtle and significant ways, showing how his presence enriched her life. This character development would allow you to mourn his death with her and, in turn, connect more deeply with the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect more than just the bare bones: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to offer that substance. (*takes a deep breath*) Sometimes it's tempting to skim over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who, you know, used to be in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, and secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday while indulging in a hearty breakfast of Eggs Benedict.\n\nPay attention to the meat, not just the bone.",
            "I tuned into two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live NBC 4 report on August 13, 2011, featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio who had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was shown, and he appeared menacing. The story was given two minutes, which I thought was reasonable given that it was still developing. The second story was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers who was critically injured in a shooting in Sharon Woods. There were no arrests or suspects yet, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect this was due to the victim being a minority. I've noticed that media coverage often glosses over stories involving minority victims. Conversely, if a \"white\" child or adult is involved, it's a different story. The following report was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The weather report predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This story was a teaser to keep viewers watching. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF was also reported, with the suspect described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. I found it unusual that such emphasis was placed on his race. Another story detailed the conviction of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. It was unclear why the sentence was stated in months rather than years, and his Hispanic background seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There's a unique bond between brothers; it's an unshakable, unchangeable connection. Within this bond, a swirl of emotions exist: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty, among others. Brothers understand each other deeply, seeing themselves reflected in one another's eyes. This bond is most evident in dire situations, where the raw emotions shine through, whether they're positive or negative. These emotions come at a price, and understanding them means dealing with their consequences. When a brother looks into another's eyes, they see not just another person but their own true self. The actions and consequences of those actions reveal their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the emotions it sparks. Through a richly described landscape, these boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in the story's climax, and only one brother survives the encounter. The theme is explored through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with others, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which shares the complex feelings of the protagonist and his views of the world, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one key emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who would be his pupil, learning all his worldly skills like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\". He dreamed of a brother who would race to Horsehead Landing and perch with him in the great pine tree. These dreams were dashed when he realized that Doodle's weak heart made him unlikely to survive, let alone participate in vigorous activities. The protagonist even considered suffocating Doodle with a pillow, a chilling thought for a child his age, but his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him.

Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and finally, a computer, these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions. As you delve into the brain's workings, remember that each metaphor has a shelf life beyond which it may lose its usefulness.\n\nInformation processing begins with your senses, converting physical stimuli like tactile, thermal, auditory, or visual signals into electrochemical messages. These signals are continually transformed by the brain's algorithms, using both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and edge location to recognize the box. Top-down processing employs earlier decisions to expedite the identification process, such as distinguishing a black box from a hole.\n\nAttention filters, crucial for information processing, decide the signal's importance and which cognitive processes should engage with it. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from individually noticing them. Conversely, your name can be picked out even in a noisy environment. Various processing stages, each repeatedly influenced by attention, shape the final output.\n\nInformation must be stored for the brain to process it effectively. Different types of memory exist: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with unique encoding methods for different stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Maintaining stored information involves various mechanisms, with working memory, which holds data for around 20 seconds, being sustained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nMany theories describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can further connect to “wooden,” illustrating the complex web of associations.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" serves as a cautionary tale about the looming threats of technology and capitalism, illustrating a dystopian society where the individual is overshadowed by the collective. From birth, citizens are conditioned to prioritize immediate happiness over all else, with the World Controller dictating their lives. This can be analyzed through a Marxist lens, highlighting the author's concerns about the developments of such systems. Key terms like homogeny and reification emphasize the commentaries on the flaws of the capitalist economy from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the general populace remains unaware of their true economic relations. The workers, or \"proletariat,\" are manipulated into consuming and indulging, driven by hypnopædia, thus reinforcing the capitalist structure. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, are completely unaware of their manipulation, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, may be aware but remain complacent. Hegemony, the idea that one class dominates another, is evident here, with the lower classes buying into the ideology of capitalism and consumerism. The lack of meaningful relationships and the superficial nature of interactions – with comments focusing on physical appearance – further highlight the societal impact of capitalism. Man's free will is suppressed, and emotions are kept in check, illustrating how capitalism can oppress individuals and control their actions.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the sprawling campus can be a challenge, especially for freshmen like me who were placed in East Halls dorms, which are far from the center. Walking to classes in places like the Willard building can take up to 25 minutes on a bad weather day. Not long ago, these East Halls were isolated by vast, empty fields, but now they're surrounded by new sports facilities, buildings, and apartments, making it even harder to get around. The solution? Cycling. But it's not just about having a bike; the campus needs to be designed for cyclists too.\n\nRecently, I spoke to a friend who returned to cycling after a hiatus. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around, and it's good for you too.\" Cycling is incredibly efficient - a bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you far. I, too, live off campus, and the smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. Instead of walking to Thomas building, which would take 25 minutes, I can now get there in just 5 minutes by bike. However, Pollock Road, the straightest path to Thomas, isn't always pleasant to cycle on. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. Over the course of a week, that's over two and a half hours. Add that to the time spent walking to other classes and appointments, and it's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My journey into the social work field has been a pursuit of a path to help children who have faced abuse or neglect, and to support troubled families. The values I bring to this field include service, respect, ethical integrity, and a commitment to enhance relationships within families and myself, ensuring I stay competent in my field. These values resonate deeply with my personal beliefs.\n\nI've always harbored a desire to assist others, but the specific career path eluded me through high school and college. Many individuals evaded their problems through denial, while others resorted to less-than-healthy coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations solidified my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Post-graduation, I took a break from the academic world. One summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a troubled teenager. He was escaping his abusive parents, and the next day, he involved the police. I drove to his parents' house to offer help, and though the law couldn't intervene, I spoke with his parents. They were defensive and blamed his “manipulative” behavior for involving outsiders. This encounter sparked my interest in social work, seeing it as a way to help children navigate family disputes.\n\nSocial justice is another core value in this field. Our society claims to value individuality but often follows archaic traditions, making it challenging to be truly unique. I've protested against this contradiction throughout my education. I dyed my hair, wore non-conforming clothes, pierced my ears, joined GSBA, and stood up against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to advocate for it.",
            "The following paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to insomnia. The Biological model centers on genetic inheritance and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review explores these models through a selection of research studies, explaining each and critiquing their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Hypersomnia, deal with initiating or maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder affect sleep behavior. The following review zeroes in on insomnia and its relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice showed that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons control sleep and wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety. A study found that the GABAB agonist (baclofen) significantly increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This indicates that animal models can be applied to human studies, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for human sleep regulation. A dysfunction in this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, altered receptors would naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting daily life, including school, work, and monotonous tasks that require focus.",
            "This article explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It begins by defining the disorder, then outlines how it’s diagnosed, including common signs or “red flags,” and finally suggests ways educators can support students with CAPD in a mainstream classroom setting.\n\nCAPD, or APD, is essentially how well our central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. The brain struggles to interpret sounds, even though hearing is normal. Those affected can't distinguish words, separate conversation from background noise, or recognize sound patterns. They might miss sarcasm or have difficulties with sound sequences.\n\nCAPD was first recognized in the mid-1950s, initially called “auditory imperception.” Italian researchers led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for affected children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and a model for explaining how the brain processes these sounds. A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include: not being able to locate sounds, having trouble distinguishing between sounds, missing sound patterns, misunderstanding speech changes, and difficulties with sound sequences. Diagnosis involves screening using various tools, as there’s no single diagnostic test. This might include questionnaires, observations, and tests that present multiple simultaneous sounds.\n\nMany educators may wonder how to assist students with CAPD in a mainstream classroom. The article offers suggestions for creating an inclusive learning environment, such as simplifying instructions, reducing background noise, and providing visual aids to support auditory information.",
            "Every day that I return to my Taipei home, I am greeted by the sight of Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting /memorizing to someone else.",
            "German colonial rule has been widely criticized for its harshness, most notably in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. However, it's important to remember that an empire as vast as the German colonial empire couldn't be understood through such a simple lens. It was characterized by a wide range of policies and ruling styles, reflected in its educational systems. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they found a sizeable educated and literate African population. Similar praise was given to German educational efforts in colonies like Kamerun. In stark contrast, South West Africa (now Namibia) saw a completely different reality. The German government left the task of educating the natives almost entirely to mission societies with limited support, while they invested heavily in European education, establishing state schools and regulating mission schools. This had lasting effects, leaving the majority of the population uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There's a considerable body of literature on German colonial education, much of it in German and written post-1900. Early works focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies, while later English works expanded the discourse through comparative studies and detailed analyses. Cohen's study, for example, compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing many of the differences to the large settler population in South West Africa. Unlike Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a moderate climate, but a significant portion of the territory was desert. This influenced the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living there by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past 100 years has led to a massive array of genres, making it challenging to list them all. The sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within these genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have multiplied, with Heavy Metal rock becoming notably diverse and expressive in the past 40 years. This genre's flexibility has inspired numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, creating a labyrinth of niches that define it today. The boundaries between what is considered Heavy Metal are blurred, incorporating themes from other genres. To grasp the current metal music landscape, one must first understand the movement's origins and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is often characterized by its \"more\" philosophy—more bass, volume, violence, theatricality, and technical prowess. Musicians in metal bands are skilled and proficient, which resonates in their music's complexity. It has also been a movement heavily influenced by psychedelic drug culture, with the mid-70s boom leading to experimental, otherworldly records. The dark, visceral qualities of metal were innovative at the time, as most popular music lacked this emotional depth. Later generations of metal artists have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark themes. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' Helter Skelter exemplify this darkness, showcasing the genre's heavier, darker side. This song is often considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, a response to a Rolling Stones song, as the Beatles sought to prove they could match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Years before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was meticulously weaving his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist, captures not just a woman marveling at the wonders of her dream land, but also Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. From the start, he harbored a longing for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. However, he found himself grappling with a challenging internal conflict: should he conform to or mimic certain styles to be accepted by the critical art world he admired, or should he forge his own independent path?\n\nTo truly understand The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in the northwest French town of Laval, Rousseau's father was a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Growing up, he received no formal art education and worked for France as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname douanier, or customs inspector. The passing of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only one daughter, Julia, and profound grief. Hence, he turned to painting for solace and new beginnings, unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized and sentimentalized peasants in their art. Rousseau was essentially a folk painter and mirrored the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with gaining acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable given his context: he was uneducated in fine arts and began his career late in life, producing art alongside well-known, talented contemporaries. Remarkably, he didn't receive proper recognition until around the same time Matisse was rising to fame. In Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse and Rousseau were competitors, they differed in style, subject matter, and their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting tritely, while Rousseau desired to paint so conventionally that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have posited a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason for this. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn much in life through education or experience, yet we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics seemingly without instruction. Both fields strive to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than prescribing rules. For instance, discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might explore elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully capture why it's good art. Instead, when asked about a favorite piece, we often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before diving into more complex explanations. Both art and morality can't be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" Likewise, ethics has this same quality, as Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I believe this intangible essence, this \"je ne sais quoi,\" is art and morality's most powerful attribute, linking them deeply. We experience both morality and art most powerfully at a noumenal level, as Kant might put it—impacting us in ways that can be felt but not fully explained. This is especially true in literature, as McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" We value literature precisely because it reflects the values we hold in life.",
            "Germany today stands as a powerful, unified country, blending its unique culture from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This cultural mosaic stretches from Cologne, along the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, and up to the Elbe's banks in the Saxon city of Dresden. It's no surprise, then, that modern Germany is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name whose origins are debated by scholars. Some argue it came from the Germanic tribe called Tungrians, or from the Old Irish word 'garim' meaning 'to shout,' indicating the Germans' loud nature. Tacitus, a Roman historian, wrote in AD 98 that the Germans were aboriginals who did not mix with other races. He also noted that those who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy or Germany would do so only if it were their home. Similarly, Romans ventured into Germania for goods and services, but seldom stayed, leaving it to the Germanic tribes who lived on the empire's borders.\n\nNow",
            "I stood gazing at the scene before me, my mind void of any thoughts, passively observing the view without engaging it. I had been trained to study my surroundings with an unemotional detachment, to analyze them without connecting them to any abstract concepts. My thoughts came and went as swiftly as the objects in my field of vision. It felt as though I was not thinking at all, just experiencing what lay before me in a smooth, fluid state.\n\nYears ago, an artist I worked with recommended to me a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn to draw and this book promised to teach everything from understanding a pencil to the brain's interpretation of lines. One of its techniques was to frame any picture you want to study with a square, turning an overly detailed scene into a simplified one.\n\nAs I stared at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't impose an artist's frame on it. I was too overwhelmed by the beauty and complexity of the scene. I felt like I was looking at the beginnings of a grand piece of art, a masterpiece in the making. The first brushstroke, the first stroke of a master's brush, so to speak.\n\nMy fingers touched the brush, my hand moving through space, translating my will into action. The water in the bowl was clear and still, reflecting the light, the flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. My hand, now more anxious and restless, hit the brush against the toilet again, but the stubborn brown package refused to budge, stuck to the bottom like a slug.\n\nI held the mop loosely in my hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie knotted tightly around my neck. I frowned as I looked at the offending package, a message left by a careless cleaner. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, and then I grabbed the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it formed an oven mitt. I stood up straight, then bent over, my hand slowly dipping into the bowl, like a mother reaching for the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven...",
            "Every day, our roads are claiming young lives due to a perfect storm of inexperience and adolescent inclination to take risks. The National Institutes of Health tell us that the teen brain isn't fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving, and simple inexperience leads to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road incidents. Peer pressure exacerbates this, with teens often driving with friends, as anyone who's ever been young knows. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the more passengers a teen has, the higher the risk of accidents.\n\nStates have tried to curb teen driving fatalities by introducing temporary provisional licenses limiting driving hours and preventing other minors as passengers. However, these are mere band-aids. The real issue is that, as a group, teens are statistically ill-equipped to handle driving's risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes 18 is too young for a regular license. USA Today reports his research shows teens under 19-20 crave thrills, making it logical to delay driving until this urge diminishes. If we continue to license young teens, deaths will likely surge, especially with millions of Baby Boomer's children becoming eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nSimplifying the law would involve maintaining driver's education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could drive without a full license. A provisional permit could still be issued, requiring a set number of practical training hours, likely based on current state requirements. A national, uniform law would protect teens across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not unprecedented.",
            "As I delved into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My study mainly focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and analyzing the unique traits of a few later ones. Trick films around the turn of the century were generally confined to a single set within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the rule that one shot equals one film. However, some early 20th-century films dared to break these rules by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne striking aspect that trick films share is their filming in a set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary to capture figures or objects, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville traditions. This often constrains characters to move side-to-side within the frame, rather than towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, without the camera following them.\n\nShots in trick films tend to be long and medium, with close-ups never used. This comes from the theatre tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at once. Actors rarely move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent. Most early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the dramatic usage of trick films, focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single shot may actually be several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearance. Carefully examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) to see how the \"physical shot\" of Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, despite the film's conceptual unity as a single shot.",
            "John Taylor, from Caroline, was an early and passionate believer in Republicanism. His primary occupation as an agriculturalist, along with his brief political career, shaped him into a strong advocate for personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system underpinned his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system, free from established traditions that could hinder the creation of a self-governing society. He held firm beliefs in natural rights, considering them interdependent and beyond the reach of government. He argued that physical prowess and malevolent intelligence should not dictate society's rules, unlike in a state of nature.\n\nTo cultivate this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government acknowledging both the good and evil inherent in man. He believed in a dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on such principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a government with no additional rights or powers beyond what was explicitly stated, fearing an extensive Federal government could become despotic. However, he also cautioned against a strict, literal interpretation, as it could become corrupt without considering the intent of the writers. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, more explicitly describing it as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. The reason behind this dip is unclear, although it coincides with the onset of winter in New England, which typically leads to fewer bicycle and foot commuters. The end of the fall semester, with its rush of final exams and grade processing, could also have contributed to the decline. The holiday season brings a month-long break in December, during which many do not need to come to campus. January's delayed resumption of classes may also be a factor. The low submission numbers in February, however, remain unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project could have waned naturally. To reinvigorate participation, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that resulted in a spike in log submissions. This project faced challenges in maintaining momentum due to holiday breaks and semester schedules, as well as the deeply ingrained preference for driving that characterizes our culture. We offered various prizes to encourage alternative commuting modes. These included gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a bookstore, and even national chain stores. To potentially boost participation further, larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars could have been considered. If the value of the prizes were to increase over time, this might have also helped. Initially, our gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing a bicycle giveaway in December and a hybrid/electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than decrease it.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility and stock-like trading on an exchange. It offers the diversification of an index fund along with the advantages of single stock ownership, such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. While these benefits are highly attractive, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks too, like the need to pay a commission on trades, just as you would with stock orders. Additionally, ETFs come in a wide variety of funds, but savvy investors should evaluate whether these stated benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent. For this analysis, we will examine the IHF ETF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF offers benefits close to those of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could yield a higher Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo keep the analysis manageable, we've decided to include only the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of all assets in the ETF. Below is a list of these top 10 holdings and their respective percentage of total assets.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the IHF ETF as a whole, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and return, using the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%. The calculations for Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio made up of the top 10 holdings would generate a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it's important to note that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-Land,\" one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed finer poems, employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott traces this reference to Virgil, who used it to describe an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, there's a more contemporary connection to consider. Poe was fascinated by German literature, particularly the works of Goethe.\n\nThis reference is crucial as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt notes the similarity between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" concluding that Poe was likely imitating the latter. \"Faust,\" a celebrated poetic drama by Goethe, was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. The second part contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells of a king who loses his wife and subsequently his life over his grief and drinking.\n\nPoe incorporates \"Thulé\" twice in his works. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs it as a framing device for the entire poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thulé as dark, lonely, and haunted by the ghosts of friends, reminiscent of the fate of the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem. The entire poem seems to be a reflection of stepping into Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe, a significant author, would have been known to Poe not only for his respect for Tennyson but also due to the numerous reproductions of his works circulating after his death.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, resulting in injury, be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed of the spill twice and failed to clean it up for a half-hour because he was dining? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To seek such damages, Palmer must show that the defendant's actions were willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm, as well as that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the spill's potential harm, considering multiple previous incidents, and that his failure to act was despicable given the ongoing safety issues. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed manager Paul Martin about the spill, and he responded he was on dinner break. Another employee notified him at 5:15 pm, to no avail. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is suing for damages, and we are considering a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Courts have defined malicious conduct as knowing the probable harm and willfully failing to avoid it.

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the most contentious topics of discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that this question has become even more pertinent today. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I’ve noticed a shift in the mass media’s portrayal of Islam and extremists, ranging from a hostile view to an extreme form of tolerance in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have imagined a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet is fascinating to me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, it contradicts his personality. From what I’ve learned in the past, I thought Muhammad was a forceful figure who would conquer tribes and force them to convert to Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr who was misunderstood and humbled himself to others, leading people to see the ‘truth’ in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between Jesus’ ministries and the ‘miracles’ attributed to Muhammad. The most notable example is when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of writing makes me believe the authors wanted Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet who didn’t need to prove anything, simply living in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is particularly concerning because it diminishes the miracle and life of Jesus Christ, as if they are trying to appropriate Jesus’ life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography seem to serve an agenda of providing proof of ‘witnesses’ or of how people converted to Islam ‘on their own.’ However, many of these stories are third-party accounts, with the author claiming to have heard them from others, who heard from others, and so on. This approach makes the stories seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical records contradict the idea of Muhammad being a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they were during his lifetime, were quickly swept aside in the evolution of Christian thought that followed. If we paint a broad picture of this history, we see a trend of Christianity moving steadily away from its roots. Today, we witness an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people persist and may resist new thinking, their influence may not be significant enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, there is a growing historical awareness, a yearning to distinguish the doctrines that were incorporated over time from the original intent of the religion's namesake. This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a great reversal in the trend of Christian history, a progression back to its original form. A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock is moving backward, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to humanity remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if living during Jesus' time, the church will remain robust, guiding the way. However, with the theological clock moving backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. We will see less difference and more similarity among regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind. Throughout history, great reversals have occurred. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became Christianized. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the Christian religion, undoing history to find the source and reducing diversity in the process. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. Then, what happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look back far enough in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the notion of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core of the religion. However, the Jewish population was not united; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle exposes the inherent greed and self-centeredness of human nature, demonstrating that people are driven to improve their own lives without considering others, especially those less fortunate. The novel illustrates this through the actions of factory owners and managers, who prioritize their own wealth and success over any cost to workers or the environment. According to Upton Sinclair, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" depicting the immense pollution caused by these factories. The owners show no remorse for the people or animals harmed by this pollution, including the thousands of pens filled with animal waste.\n\nThe owners also exploit their employees, forcing them to work grueling hours and providing little compensation. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers face layoffs without notice, leaving them without jobs and assistance. The lack of laws or regulations to protect workers allowed managers and owners to operate with impunity, pushing employees to work in horrific conditions. The novel suggests that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh living and working conditions. There were no agencies to aid these workers, and unions often caused more harm than good, lining their own pockets rather than helping the workers. The workers were effectively slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes toward crucial subjects. Some of these methods are more successful than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a multitude of these strategies in his novel The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, he links an adjective with a noun that doesn't typically pair to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he imparts meaning to a symbol and then uses it for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently uses the latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up associations for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later employs to remind readers of specific feelings related to important objects.\n\nFitzgerald imbues white/gray with a sense of uniformity, with white signifying a refined, high-class image and gray representing something older and faded. He introduces this meaning in the beginning of the novel through recurrent use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently “in white” (8), and everyone at Gatsby’s party wears white: Nick in “white flannels” (41), Tom in a “white shirt” (36), and Catherine “powdered milky white” (30). The only time people aren’t in white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by using them to paint common, unimportant subjects: Nick commutes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are “gray names” (61) on Nick’s schedule, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), and he describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs white/gray to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects, starting with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald continues this technique around Daisy to emphasize her uniformity, such as the “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18) and her appearance in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts an agriculturally diverse landscape, thanks to its mild, sunny climate. Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the region, with numerous local organizations sporting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, allowing for educational and financial opportunities. This approach enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and recreational use.",
            "Culture, in essence, is a complex tapestry. It's not merely what it appears to be, but also what it isn't, and what it symbolizes. Culture isn't something uniform or singular, like a specific thing. Generalizations about cultures, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are often too broad and simplistic. While acknowledging a culture's general traits is useful, it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the significance of that culture to the situation and how it might influence the negotiation table. When interacting with a foreign culture, one naturally relates it to their own, leading to comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or altering a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its guidelines, especially when negotiating from a weaker position or on foreign turf. Acknowledging traditions and beliefs can help navigate cultural barriers and propel the negotiation forward. Remember, culture isn't confined to national or international borders—most companies within a country develop their own corporate cultures. For instance, some may prioritize long office hours, while others might favor a more relaxed schedule. These nuances can be observed in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same societal culture, there can be vast differences from company to company, or even between regions. Values are particularly crucial to understand, as they provide the underlying reasons for a culture's behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony are valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly shaming their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, if a culture emphasizes a hard-driven bargain, a negotiator won't rush to settle. While these general insights are helpful, it's also wise to learn more about the opponent's personal background to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool, in his hubris, argues that there is no God. St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two figures of considerable theological influence, both challenge this notion, each offering their own arguments to prove the existence of the Biblical God. To evaluate their arguments, we must first acknowledge their shared belief in God, as their respective defenses of this concept are the focus of our inquiry. Any deviation from this specific God would render their arguments incomparable. With this in mind, let us explore their arguments. St. Anselm's argument revolves around the notion that God's existence can be understood through faith and introspection. He posits that God is inherently part of our understanding, making the concept of God's nonexistence inconceivable. This idea, while complex and sometimes unclear, suggests that the proof of God lies within our own minds, eliminating the need for external evidence. This is a central tenet of Christian belief, often referred to as faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, posits that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, without the need for faith. Such an approach would be advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of new converts based on logical persuasion rather than faith alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments in support of his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates the logical necessity for God's existence. If one piece of a puzzle were missing, logical deduction would allow us to understand and prove its existence without physically seeing it.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism—the most traditional form of which is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now about twenty-five hundred years old, has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This change can be observed today, for example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople participate in this event, which, despite Buddha never teaching about it, holds great religious significance. Such differences extend from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the perspective of monks and laypeople, has adapted its doctrinal principles over time due to both internal and external influences, ranging from hostile to benign.\n\nVarious terms are crucial to this discussion. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces negatively impact the Buddhist community, often stemming from misperceptions of Buddhism, while benign forces, though not necessarily intending to help or harm, may still influence the community. These terms will be frequently used throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, we must explore the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is composed of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of all things. Recognizing these concepts allows one to break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which ends the trio of attachments: lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules of life, with five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicants) and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrine is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and the path to the end of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States emerged victorious and acquired Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. There were numerous other conflicts between the two nations, which finally eased up just before the First World War. Like many other nations, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico began due to clashes over religious, cultural, and traditional differences, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not uncommon among nations sharing a border, as the proximity often leads to rivalries over shared territory. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41), as these nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations that have maintained good relations with the U.S. Religious issues created a divide between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). The rivalry was part ideological struggle and part competition over vital interests, not based on political structure but on religious preferences. This distrust dated back to the animosity between the English and Spanish, making amicable foreign relations difficult. Diehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this rivalry period, with most involving territorial issues such as border raids and frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American towns into Mexican territory were a persistent issue until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). The rivalry began to ease as Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the late 19th century (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, illness struck suddenly and without warning, leaving me disabled and unprepared. I was a nurse at the time, drawn to the profession due to a deep-seated need for the stability and security it promised. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" was the refrain I heard as I grew older. So, even though my heart yearned for science or journalism, I chose nursing. Yet, here I was: forty-six, single, penniless, and unable to work. For fifteen years, Social Security Disability has been my lifeline, but it has left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a battle for security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, yet one thing is clear: I would not have survived these years without the support of my family and a few steadfast friends.\n\nLife is filled with emergencies, big and small. Some challenges are too great to face alone, no matter how well we prepare. I strongly believe we should stop relying solely on large government systems that are failing. Instead, let's foster a culture of mutual trust and assistance, where we learn to help each other and ask for help when needed.\n\nConservatives often talk about the rugged individualism that built this country, but it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources that sustained our forefathers in tough times. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone; they relied on each other.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have emergency supplies, from first-aid kits to canned goods and water purifying tablets. I have flashlights, candles, and matches. If you have the means, consider growing your own food or installing a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you prepare, don't forget to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms adapt and evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the course of evolutionary change? While D’Arcy Thompson asserted in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same uncertainty persists today. However, recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can reveal the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that form the basis for modeling hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that traverses through 360 degrees of space over time, with each revolution or turn of a coiled shell called a whorl. These whorls move around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The enlargement rate of whorls can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl, and the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the base is the opposite end. The animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation of a shell is an apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upward.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are then counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a progression of apertures through both time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to influence the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "In Indonesia, the neonatal and infant mortality rate has barely budged over the past decade, despite the country's progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets. While strides have been made in child and maternal health, we're still far behind the goal posts for 2015. Let's delve into the reasons why and consider what needs to be beefed up: our health system, perhaps, rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile we've seen a boost in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, reaching 72%, the picture isn't entirely rosy. Traditional midwives, who can't provide advanced medical care, make up a chunk of this number, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate from conditions like hemorrhage. The uptick in births attended isn't the full story here. We've also seen a dip in the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Postnatal care data is sketchy, but it's clear that it's a concern nationwide, with low rates across the board.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still subpar at 4%, with a stark urban-rural divide. Urban areas boast a 7% rate, while rural areas lag at 2%. This underscores the inequity in healthcare access, which is heavily skewed towards urban areas. Furthermore, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, highlighting the struggle for the poor to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, as we ponder how to improve neonatal and maternal care, we must ask: should we prioritize developing targeted programs or bolstering the overall health system? Program-specific approaches are tempting. They offer clear, manageable objectives and can yield quicker results. However, they can also lead to funding and resource imbalances, with certain areas, like HIV/AIDS, receiving disproportionate attention. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to service duplication and an overwhelming amount of paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature often showcases meticulous attention to detail and an emphasis on the upper classes. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, typical of the period. These unusual aspects contribute to the characters' development, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n\nThese novels often use mystery and dreamlike states to convey their themes, with each approach differing. For instance, in Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences reveal his inner turmoil, the things that trouble him, and his understanding of the world around him. When Oliver revisits the shooting in chapter 28, he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, his dire health situation, and the constant fear and despair that haunt him. The shooting highlights Oliver's helplessness to effect any change, even during life-threatening situations. It suggests that he has little control over his circumstances, reinforced by the sense of defeat and resignation as if old Fagin has broken him.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years back, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged kids. While I could help them with various subjects, my strengths were in English and reading. I was asked to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. His difficulties were peculiar; he could pronounce certain letters correctly while others were a mystery. He spoke perfect English but was having trouble with the English alphabet. It wasn't until I met his mom that I understood the issue; Adrian could read, but he didn't know the alphabet well. I hope he's improved now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, especially in California. Even a kid who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. This problem is evident, and solutions aren't straightforward. In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations, helped. But for kids who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no single answer. Combining all approaches—dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—is the key to addressing this issue.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is beneficial. Not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for all. Studies show that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. However, fear and misconceptions surround this idea, such as it being a resource drain or unhelpful for the majority. But that's not true. If implemented as the norm, all children would benefit. How do we achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? Not necessarily. It's more practical to have bilingual aids or tutors to support these programs.",
            "From the moment we are little, many of us are told there's something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully grasp. Some of us attend Sunday school, others visit temples, or delve within ourselves for answers. Many readily embrace the faith passed down by our parents, but some reject it entirely, dismissing the possibility of anything beyond our personal realities. Still, we all journey to define pieces of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a beacon in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to the rain's relentless drumming on the tin roof above while we smoked. The gutters channeled the rain, drenching the plants along the porch's edge. He stared out into the storm, his eyes half lost in thought, half recalling memories. His once sturdy frame now seemed frail, his clothes loose and shapeless. His hair, thinned, fails to hide the signs of the illness. He gazed out into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt alone, afraid, and silenced by my fear of discussing the inevitable. I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and joined him in watching the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away five days after my twenty-second birthday, in December of that year. The treatments had not lessened his suffering but prolonged it, keeping him alive a few more months than expected. The purpose of his prolonged suffering was unclear to me. The thought of a God who would allow this crossed my mind. I found no solace in prayer that night. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening long ago.\n\nI declined to witness his passing into another realm. I couldn't bear to watch the life that formed me fade away. I chose to remember him through the life he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone, better than his own family. I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in my bed for three days, awaiting the news, only to find that no one called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt puts it, is a paradoxical blend of \"old\" and \"new,\" both in name and substance, in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both lauded and criticized, praised for its 'terrible sublime' and accused of lacking depth. The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements of ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new form of literary expression. Walpole combined old theatrical elements with new naturalistic mimicry in modern novels, labeling it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic novels often hark back to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, seen as archaic or unsophisticated. The fusion of the more theatrical Gothic and the novel's personal perspective is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers far removed from the original era.\n\nA prominent Gothic theme is the concept of Chivalry. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retained and transformed the medieval idea of chivalry. Chivalry, representing the ideal knight, was appealing to Gothic writers because of the lack of that ideal in contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" was idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in his characters, particularly Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, being described as a brave and courteous knight, even if exaggeratedly so (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of operations that transforms customer orders into finished products and delivers them. This concept was introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982 and encompasses planning, implementing, and guiding the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. The six critical components of a supply chain are production, sourcing, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business leaders utilize these elements to deliver superior customer service. Production is the cornerstone of the supply chain, involving the who, what, when, where, and how of making products. Managers must understand market demands to make informed decisions. By examining the market, managers can discern customer preferences and determine which products to produce and in what quantities. After deciding what to produce, managers must choose the optimal production location based on volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Following this, they focus on scheduling production and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial for the supply chain; each detail must be meticulously planned to avoid future costs in time and money. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where each aspect of the business had a detailed plan, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Well-defined processes ensure smooth operations and clear expectations. The second key element in supply chain management is sourcing. This involves strategic decisions about core facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the best-fitting division for each product process. Outsourcing can be employed to enhance velocity, which refers to providing quality and flexibility while minimizing costs.",
            "Every day I walk down the streets of Burma, I am greeted by a haunting sign. It reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" scrawled in black Sharpie on a cardboard held by Ellen Page, the actress from Juno. Burma, or Myanmar as it is officially known, is a country in Southeastern Asia ruled by a stern military junta that seized power in 1962. In 2007, a series of public protests erupted, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" led by monks dressed in their saffron robes. The government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the violence escalated, and the military openly attacked monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested, and one Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed during a street protest in September of 2007. While the official death toll stands at 13, some suggest the real number could be in the thousands.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, many governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors are considered gods. In our own time, our president, George W. Bush, reportedly holds weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nOther notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest authoritarian rule, resulting in a death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000 people. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. And let’s not forget Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" a period of widespread atrocities against Jews and others.",
            "Every time I listen to Duke Ellington’s music, I marvel at his enduring impact on jazz. This longevity is largely due to his mastery of his orchestra, orchestrating complex pieces that highlight each band member’s unique talents. Ellington’s compositions often feature subtle piano interplay, yet he excelled in creating rich, intricate arrangements that allowed soloists to freely improvise while maintaining a cohesive sound.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, as seen in Creole Love Call. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece uses call and response between voice and reeds to add layers of texture and color. The voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound. The muted trumpet and clarinet solos elaborate on the melody, while the full band echoes the first chorus. The climactic chorus features a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time. The final chorus returns to the original structure, with the voice taking on a “growl” technique. A brief tag ends with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone novelty.\n\nThis use of voice to enhance tone color is a signature of Ellington’s style. In Hot and Bothered, he combines tight orchestration with tone color, using Bubber Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing to create a complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) showcases Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone in a similar fashion.",
            "She had always felt an insatiable yearning for something, a need that couldn't be satisfied. This longing began when she was 14, entering her teenage years, and it persisted at 17. While she'd defined her desire as someone rather than something, she'd found no interest in boys. Some had tried to woo her, but she remained untouched. She often questioned herself, trying to deduce the cause of her indifference. Years of contemplation offered theories, but no conclusive answers. Therefore, she lived life, always questioning her desires.\n\nA normal day at home was usually peaceful, with parents who rarely argued and a daughter who was both lively and lovable.

The doctors took her, and she was left to wait in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach the highest cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower likelihood of stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a version of the Med diet, featuring increased consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (versus saturated fats), and fish, while lowering intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious research has shown an inverse correlation between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial also found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, prior studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis research followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study—a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. More than 95% of nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation checks. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from the two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal CHD and strokes) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America experienced a severe financial collapse. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market plummeted, and many of America’s biggest corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, raising the question: how did this crisis happen, and how can we prevent it in the future? Simply put, the financial crisis was born from self-centered and naïve political choices that pushed banks and companies into issuing sub-prime loans to an already underprepared and weak financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks found themselves lacking capital reserves and passed this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration in 1999. Aiming for a second term, President Clinton sought to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions, which laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, has faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgages for low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences, stating, “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government rescue like the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foretold, reckless lending would indeed bring about economic disaster.\nMany factors combined to send the economy into a tailspin. One key factor was the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used leading up to the crisis, further entangling the economy in the housing market. This excessive use of leverage in the housing market made U.S. households and financial markets highly vulnerable to even slight price changes.\nThe housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities high and dry. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a combined $4.1 trillion of mortgage debt in 2007, an astounding 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, holding $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where you either soar to new heights with your captivating prose or plunge into the depths of your readers' patience. Dr. Merlin has been known to shudder at her keyboard when she finds herself wading through a swamp of unnecessary details, especially when it's not in the thrilling way. Exposition, it seems, is not your friend.\n\nYou've surely heard the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" but even Dr. Merlin trips into long stretches of unengaging text. Exposition is that sneaky little voice on your shoulder whispering, \"Get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the action (not to be confused with the voice on the other shoulder urging you to reveal every last detail of every character's life).\"\n\nExposition means telling your audience what happened, often in simple, straightforward prose. In a film, it might be when one character shares a history with another like the Ancient Mariner. In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example. Picture a story where you're told that a heroine and her love met at a certain place and time, married in a grand ceremony, and tragically, her husband was murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this tale to stretch over two pages, during which both characters only utter a few lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his deep love for his wife through his speech and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to demonstrate her attachment to him in subtle and significant ways, showing how his presence enriched her life. This character development would allow you to mourn his death with her and, in turn, connect more deeply with the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect more than just the bare bones: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to offer that substance. (*takes a deep breath*) Sometimes it's tempting to skim over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who, you know, used to be in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, and secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday while indulging in a hearty breakfast of Eggs Benedict.\n\nPay attention to the meat, not just the bone.",
            "I tuned into two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live NBC 4 report on August 13, 2011, featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio who had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was shown, and he appeared menacing. The story was given two minutes, which I thought was reasonable given that it was still developing. The second story was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers who was critically injured in a shooting in Sharon Woods. There were no arrests or suspects yet, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect this was due to the victim being a minority. I've noticed that media coverage often glosses over stories involving minority victims. Conversely, if a \"white\" child or adult is involved, it's a different story. The following report was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The weather report predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This story was a teaser to keep viewers watching. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF was also reported, with the suspect described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. I found it unusual that such emphasis was placed on his race. Another story detailed the conviction of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. It was unclear why the sentence was stated in months rather than years, and his Hispanic background seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There's a unique bond between brothers; it's an unshakable, unchangeable connection. Within this bond, a swirl of emotions exist: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty, among others. Brothers understand each other deeply, seeing themselves reflected in one another's eyes. This bond is most evident in dire situations, where the raw emotions shine through, whether they're positive or negative. These emotions come at a price, and understanding them means dealing with their consequences. When a brother looks into another's eyes, they see not just another person but their own true self. The actions and consequences of those actions reveal their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the emotions it sparks. Through a richly described landscape, these boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in the story's climax, and only one brother survives the encounter. The theme is explored through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with others, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which shares the complex feelings of the protagonist and his views of the world, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one key emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who would be his pupil, learning all his worldly skills like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\". He dreamed of a brother who would race to Horsehead Landing and perch with him in the great pine tree. These dreams were dashed when he realized that Doodle's weak heart made him unlikely to survive, let alone participate in vigorous activities. The protagonist even considered suffocating Doodle with a pillow, a chilling thought for a child his age, but his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple smile gave him hope, suggesting that his initial conviction was not strong. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The brain, a sophisticated and imaginative information processor, has seen its metaphors evolve from ancient to contemporary. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and finally, a computer, these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions. As you delve into the brain's workings, remember that each metaphor has a shelf life beyond which it may lose its usefulness.\n\nInformation processing begins with your senses, converting physical stimuli like tactile, thermal, auditory, or visual signals into electrochemical messages. These signals are continually transformed by the brain's algorithms, using both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and edge location to recognize the box. Top-down processing employs earlier decisions to expedite the identification process, such as distinguishing a black box from a hole.\n\nAttention filters, crucial for information processing, decide the signal's importance and which cognitive processes should engage with it. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from individually noticing them. Conversely, your name can be picked out even in a noisy environment. Various processing stages, each repeatedly influenced by attention, shape the final output.\n\nInformation must be stored for the brain to process it effectively. Different types of memory exist: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with unique encoding methods for different stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Maintaining stored information involves various mechanisms, with working memory, which holds data for around 20 seconds, being sustained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nMany theories describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can further connect to “wooden,” illustrating the complex web of associations.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" serves as a cautionary tale about the looming threats of technology and capitalism, illustrating a dystopian society where the individual is overshadowed by the collective. From birth, citizens are conditioned to prioritize immediate happiness over all else, with the World Controller dictating their lives. This can be analyzed through a Marxist lens, highlighting the author's concerns about the developments of such systems. Key terms like homogeny and reification emphasize the commentaries on the flaws of the capitalist economy from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the general populace remains unaware of their true economic relations. The workers, or \"proletariat,\" are manipulated into consuming and indulging, driven by hypnopædia, thus reinforcing the capitalist structure. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, are completely unaware of their manipulation, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, may be aware but remain complacent. Hegemony, the idea that one class dominates another, is evident here, with the lower classes buying into the ideology of capitalism and consumerism. The lack of meaningful relationships and the superficial nature of interactions – with comments focusing on physical appearance – further highlight the societal impact of capitalism. Man's free will is suppressed, and emotions are kept in check, illustrating how capitalism can oppress individuals and control their actions.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the sprawling campus can be a challenge, especially for freshmen like me who were placed in East Halls dorms, which are far from the center. Walking to classes in places like the Willard building can take up to 25 minutes on a bad weather day. Not long ago, these East Halls were isolated by vast, empty fields, but now they're surrounded by new sports facilities, buildings, and apartments, making it even harder to get around. The solution? Cycling. But it's not just about having a bike; the campus needs to be designed for cyclists too.\n\nRecently, I spoke to a friend who returned to cycling after a hiatus. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around, and it's good for you too.\" Cycling is incredibly efficient - a bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you far. I, too, live off campus, and the smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. Instead of walking to Thomas building, which would take 25 minutes, I can now get there in just 5 minutes by bike. However, Pollock Road, the straightest path to Thomas, isn't always pleasant to cycle on. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. Over the course of a week, that's over two and a half hours. Add that to the time spent walking to other classes and appointments, and it's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The following paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models as they pertain to insomnia. The Biological model centers on genetic inheritance and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review explores these models through a selection of research studies, explaining each and critiquing their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to other mental disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Hypersomnia, deal with initiating or maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder affect sleep behavior. The following review zeroes in on insomnia and its relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research on mice showed that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons control sleep and wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety. A study found that the GABAB agonist (baclofen) significantly increased sleep time in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This indicates that animal models can be applied to human studies, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for human sleep regulation. A dysfunction in this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, altered receptors would naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting daily life, including school, work, and monotonous tasks that require focus.",
            "This article explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). It begins by defining the disorder, then outlines how it’s diagnosed, including common signs or “red flags,” and finally suggests ways educators can support students with CAPD in a mainstream classroom setting.\n\nCAPD, or APD, is essentially how well our central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. The brain struggles to interpret sounds, even though hearing is normal. Those affected can't distinguish words, separate conversation from background noise, or recognize sound patterns. They might miss sarcasm or have difficulties with sound sequences.\n\nCAPD was first recognized in the mid-1950s, initially called “auditory imperception.” Italian researchers led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for affected children in 1954. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and a model for explaining how the brain processes these sounds. A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include: not being able to locate sounds, having trouble distinguishing between sounds, missing sound patterns, misunderstanding speech changes, and difficulties with sound sequences. Diagnosis involves screening using various tools, as there’s no single diagnostic test. This might include questionnaires, observations, and tests that present multiple simultaneous sounds.\n\nMany educators may wonder how to assist students with CAPD in a mainstream classroom. The article offers suggestions for creating an inclusive learning environment, such as simplifying instructions, reducing background noise, and providing visual aids to support auditory information.",
            "Every day that I return to my Taipei home, I am greeted by the sight of Soggy Shubert, the piano. It brings back memories of piano and ballet lessons where I received the same criticism... if only you could learn to count! I CAN count and I could then, too! However, I remember how fun it was to just play without thinking/counting, dance without memorizing steps... it felt like flying! When I see Shubert, I remember how I could lose myself and my stress in the music and think I should start playing again... but every time I sit down with Shubert, he laughs at me. His former owner, my landlady, left him several humid summers with no air conditioner, no dehumidifier and his sound-board got wet. Now, even after tuning, it is only a matter of weeks before the pegs loosen and... well you can imagine. It is less like flying and more like crawling through... Anyway, instead of playing the piano, I go dancing at salsa clubs. Well, unfortunately, the Taiwanese way is to take lessons, memorize steps and count in my ear. I'd rather feel the music have 'sweet nothings' whispered in my ear (even if I dance badly), but whatever... at least I can leave the counting /memorizing to someone else.",
            "German colonial rule has been widely criticized for its harshness, most notably in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. However, it's important to remember that an empire as vast as the German colonial empire couldn't be understood through such a simple lens. It was characterized by a wide range of policies and ruling styles, reflected in its educational systems. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they found a sizeable educated and literate African population. Similar praise was given to German educational efforts in colonies like Kamerun. In stark contrast, South West Africa (now Namibia) saw a completely different reality. The German government left the task of educating the natives almost entirely to mission societies with limited support, while they invested heavily in European education, establishing state schools and regulating mission schools. This had lasting effects, leaving the majority of the population uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There's a considerable body of literature on German colonial education, much of it in German and written post-1900. Early works focused on describing the educational systems in these colonies, while later English works expanded the discourse through comparative studies and detailed analyses. Cohen's study, for example, compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, attributing many of the differences to the large settler population in South West Africa. Unlike Germany's other colonies, South West Africa had a moderate climate, but a significant portion of the territory was desert. This influenced the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites living there by 1913, compared to around 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past 100 years has led to a massive array of genres, making it challenging to list them all. The sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within these genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have multiplied, with Heavy Metal rock becoming notably diverse and expressive in the past 40 years. This genre's flexibility has inspired numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, creating a labyrinth of niches that define it today. The boundaries between what is considered Heavy Metal are blurred, incorporating themes from other genres. To grasp the current metal music landscape, one must first understand the movement's origins and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is often characterized by its \"more\" philosophy—more bass, volume, violence, theatricality, and technical prowess. Musicians in metal bands are skilled and proficient, which resonates in their music's complexity. It has also been a movement heavily influenced by psychedelic drug culture, with the mid-70s boom leading to experimental, otherworldly records. The dark, visceral qualities of metal were innovative at the time, as most popular music lacked this emotional depth. Later generations of metal artists have drawn inspiration from the Romantic Era's dark themes. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' Helter Skelter exemplify this darkness, showcasing the genre's heavier, darker side. This song is often considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, a response to a Rolling Stones song, as the Beatles sought to prove they could match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Years before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was meticulously weaving his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist, captures not just a woman marveling at the wonders of her dream land, but also Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as an artist. From the start, he harbored a longing for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. However, he found himself grappling with a challenging internal conflict: should he conform to or mimic certain styles to be accepted by the critical art world he admired, or should he forge his own independent path?\n\nTo truly understand The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's biography. Born on May 21, 1844, in the northwest French town of Laval, Rousseau's father was a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Growing up, he received no formal art education and worked for France as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname douanier, or customs inspector. The passing of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only one daughter, Julia, and profound grief. Hence, he turned to painting for solace and new beginnings, unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized and sentimentalized peasants in their art. Rousseau was essentially a folk painter and mirrored the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\n\nRousseau's obsession with gaining acceptance in the art world is somewhat understandable given his context: he was uneducated in fine arts and began his career late in life, producing art alongside well-known, talented contemporaries. Remarkably, he didn't receive proper recognition until around the same time Matisse was rising to fame. In Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse and Rousseau were competitors, they differed in style, subject matter, and their motivations for painting: \"Matisse was a painter who feared painting tritely, while Rousseau desired to paint so conventionally that he would be accepted by the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Many great thinkers have posited a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a profound reason for this. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn much in life through education or experience, yet we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics seemingly without instruction. Both fields strive to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than prescribing rules. For instance, discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might explore elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully capture why it's good art. Instead, when asked about a favorite piece, we often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before diving into more complex explanations. Both art and morality can't be fully reduced to descriptions of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" Likewise, ethics has this same quality, as Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I believe this intangible essence, this \"je ne sais quoi,\" is art and morality's most powerful attribute, linking them deeply. We experience both morality and art most powerfully at a noumenal level, as Kant might put it—impacting us in ways that can be felt but not fully explained. This is especially true in literature, as McKean said, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" We value literature precisely because it reflects the values we hold in life.",
            "Germany today stands as a powerful, unified country, blending its unique culture from the alpine peaks of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This cultural mosaic stretches from Cologne, along the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, and up to the Elbe's banks in the Saxon city of Dresden. It's no surprise, then, that modern Germany is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name whose origins are debated by scholars. Some argue it came from the Germanic tribe called Tungrians, or from the Old Irish word 'garim' meaning 'to shout,' indicating the Germans' loud nature. Tacitus, a Roman historian, wrote in AD 98 that the Germans were aboriginals who did not mix with other races. He also noted that those who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy or Germany would do so only if it were their home. Similarly, Romans ventured into Germania for goods and services, but seldom stayed, leaving it to the Germanic tribes who lived on the empire's borders.\n\nNow",
            "I stood gazing at the scene before me, my mind void of any thoughts, passively observing the view without engaging it. I had been trained to study my surroundings with an unemotional detachment, to analyze them without connecting them to any abstract concepts. My thoughts came and went as swiftly as the objects in my field of vision. It felt as though I was not thinking at all, just experiencing what lay before me in a smooth, fluid state.\n\nYears ago, an artist I worked with recommended to me a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn to draw and this book promised to teach everything from understanding a pencil to the brain's interpretation of lines. One of its techniques was to frame any picture you want to study with a square, turning an overly detailed scene into a simplified one.\n\nAs I stared at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't impose an artist's frame on it. I was too overwhelmed by the beauty and complexity of the scene. I felt like I was looking at the beginnings of a grand piece of art, a masterpiece in the making. The first brushstroke, the first stroke of a master's brush, so to speak.\n\nMy fingers touched the brush, my hand moving through space, translating my will into action. The water in the bowl was clear and still, reflecting the light, the flakes of matter breaking away and disappearing. My hand, now more anxious and restless, hit the brush against the toilet again, but the stubborn brown package refused to budge, stuck to the bottom like a slug.\n\nI held the mop loosely in my hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie knotted tightly around my neck. I frowned as I looked at the offending package, a message left by a careless cleaner. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, and then I grabbed the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it formed an oven mitt. I stood up straight, then bent over, my hand slowly dipping into the bowl, like a mother reaching for the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven...",
            "Every day, our roads are claiming young lives due to a perfect storm of inexperience and adolescent inclination to take risks. The National Institutes of Health tell us that the teen brain isn't fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving, and simple inexperience leads to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road incidents. Peer pressure exacerbates this, with teens often driving with friends, as anyone who's ever been young knows. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the more passengers a teen has, the higher the risk of accidents.\n\nStates have tried to curb teen driving fatalities by introducing temporary provisional licenses limiting driving hours and preventing other minors as passengers. However, these are mere band-aids. The real issue is that, as a group, teens are statistically ill-equipped to handle driving's risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes 18 is too young for a regular license. USA Today reports his research shows teens under 19-20 crave thrills, making it logical to delay driving until this urge diminishes. If we continue to license young teens, deaths will likely surge, especially with millions of Baby Boomer's children becoming eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nSimplifying the law would involve maintaining driver's education classes for future drivers, but no one under 18 could drive without a full license. A provisional permit could still be issued, requiring a set number of practical training hours, likely based on current state requirements. A national, uniform law would protect teens across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not unprecedented.",
            "As I delved into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I decided to watch all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often used creative editing to create illusions. My study mainly focused on describing the poetics of most trick films and analyzing the unique traits of a few later ones. Trick films around the turn of the century were generally confined to a single set within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, using long and medium shots, and adhering to the rule that one shot equals one film. However, some early 20th-century films dared to break these rules by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne striking aspect that trick films share is their filming in a set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary to capture figures or objects, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville traditions. This often constrains characters to move side-to-side within the frame, rather than towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally, without the camera following them.\n\nShots in trick films tend to be long and medium, with close-ups never used. This comes from the theatre tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at once. Actors rarely move towards the camera, so close-ups are absent. Most early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the dramatic usage of trick films, focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts. However, a single shot may actually be several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearance. Carefully examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) to see how the \"physical shot\" of Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, despite the film's conceptual unity as a single shot.",
            "John Taylor, from Caroline, was an early and passionate believer in Republicanism. His primary occupation as an agriculturalist, along with his brief political career, shaped him into a strong advocate for personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system underpinned his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system, free from established traditions that could hinder the creation of a self-governing society. He held firm beliefs in natural rights, considering them interdependent and beyond the reach of government. He argued that physical prowess and malevolent intelligence should not dictate society's rules, unlike in a state of nature.\n\nTo cultivate this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government acknowledging both the good and evil inherent in man. He believed in a dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protected private property, enhanced agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. He believed a government founded on such principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a government with no additional rights or powers beyond what was explicitly stated, fearing an extensive Federal government could become despotic. However, he also cautioned against a strict, literal interpretation, as it could become corrupt without considering the intent of the writers. He saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, more explicitly describing it as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a sharp decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. The reason behind this dip is unclear, although it coincides with the onset of winter in New England, which typically leads to fewer bicycle and foot commuters. The end of the fall semester, with its rush of final exams and grade processing, could also have contributed to the decline. The holiday season brings a month-long break in December, during which many do not need to come to campus. January's delayed resumption of classes may also be a factor. The low submission numbers in February, however, remain unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project could have waned naturally. To reinvigorate participation, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign that resulted in a spike in log submissions. This project faced challenges in maintaining momentum due to holiday breaks and semester schedules, as well as the deeply ingrained preference for driving that characterizes our culture. We offered various prizes to encourage alternative commuting modes. These included gift certificates for local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a bookstore, and even national chain stores. To potentially boost participation further, larger prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars could have been considered. If the value of the prizes were to increase over time, this might have also helped. Initially, our gift cards seemed sufficient, but announcing a bicycle giveaway in December and a hybrid/electric car in January could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than decrease it.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a type of security designed to track an index, commodity, or basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but with greater flexibility and stock-like trading on an exchange. It offers the diversification of an index fund along with the advantages of single stock ownership, such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. While these benefits are highly attractive, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than mutual funds. However, there are some drawbacks too, like the need to pay a commission on trades, just as you would with stock orders. Additionally, ETFs come in a wide variety of funds, but savvy investors should evaluate whether these stated benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent. For this analysis, we will examine the IHF ETF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF offers benefits close to those of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could yield a higher Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo keep the analysis manageable, we've decided to include only the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of all assets in the ETF. Below is a list of these top 10 holdings and their respective percentage of total assets.\n\nTo assess how well these ten stocks represent the IHF ETF as a whole, we'll calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and return, using the current percentage of assets, normalized to 100%. The calculations for Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio made up of the top 10 holdings would generate a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. It also shows that the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These results suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it's important to note that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-Land,\" one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed finer poems, employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56. Mabbott traces this reference to Virgil, who used it to describe an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, there's a more contemporary connection to consider. Poe was fascinated by German literature, particularly the works of Goethe.\n\nThis reference is crucial as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt notes the similarity between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" concluding that Poe was likely imitating the latter. \"Faust,\" a celebrated poetic drama by Goethe, was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. The second part contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells of a king who loses his wife and subsequently his life over his grief and drinking.\n\nPoe incorporates \"Thulé\" twice in his works. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he employs it as a framing device for the entire poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thulé as dark, lonely, and haunted by the ghosts of friends, reminiscent of the fate of the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem. The entire poem seems to be a reflection of stepping into Goethe's work.\n\nGoethe, a significant author, would have been known to Poe not only for his respect for Tennyson but also due to the numerous reproductions of his works circulating after his death.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store, resulting in injury, be awarded punitive damages if the store manager was informed of the spill twice and failed to clean it up for a half-hour because he was dining? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages outright. To seek such damages, Palmer must show that the defendant's actions were willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm, as well as that the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the spill's potential harm, considering multiple previous incidents, and that his failure to act was despicable given the ongoing safety issues. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed manager Paul Martin about the spill, and he responded he was on dinner break. Another employee notified him at 5:15 pm, to no avail. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is suing for damages, and we are considering a motion to dismiss the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” Courts have defined malicious conduct as knowing the probable harm and willfully failing to avoid it.

            "Almost four years ago, I took a course in Islam at CBC. One of the most contentious topics of discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that this question has become even more pertinent today. Looking back on the events since 9/11, I’ve noticed a shift in the mass media’s portrayal of Islam and extremists, ranging from a hostile view to an extreme form of tolerance in America. I don’t think in 2001 we could have imagined a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet is fascinating to me because, according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, it contradicts his personality. From what I’ve learned in the past, I thought Muhammad was a forceful figure who would conquer tribes and force them to convert to Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr who was misunderstood and humbled himself to others, leading people to see the ‘truth’ in his teachings and seek him out.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between Jesus’ ministries and the ‘miracles’ attributed to Muhammad. The most notable example is when he multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of writing makes me believe the authors wanted Muhammad to be perceived as a humble prophet who didn’t need to prove anything, simply living in truth and miracles. This sort of fallacy is particularly concerning because it diminishes the miracle and life of Jesus Christ, as if they are trying to appropriate Jesus’ life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography seem to serve an agenda of providing proof of ‘witnesses’ or of how people converted to Islam ‘on their own.’ However, many of these stories are third-party accounts, with the author claiming to have heard them from others, who heard from others, and so on. This approach makes the stories seem less reliable and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical records contradict the idea of Muhammad being a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs of Jesus, as they were during his lifetime, were quickly swept aside in the evolution of Christian thought that followed. If we paint a broad picture of this history, we see a trend of Christianity moving steadily away from its roots. Today, we witness an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people persist and may resist new thinking, their influence may not be significant enough to shape the whole. Among Christians, there is a growing historical awareness, a yearning to distinguish the doctrines that were incorporated over time from the original intent of the religion's namesake. This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a great reversal in the trend of Christian history, a progression back to its original form. A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of doctrine one by one, as if the clock is moving backward, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to humanity remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if living during Jesus' time, the church will remain robust, guiding the way. However, with the theological clock moving backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. We will see less difference and more similarity among regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind. Throughout history, great reversals have occurred. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later became Christianized. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the Christian religion, undoing history to find the source and reducing diversity in the process. This process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. Then, what happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look back far enough in history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the notion of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core of the religion. However, the Jewish population was not united; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "The Jungle exposes the inherent greed and self-centeredness of human nature, demonstrating that people are driven to improve their own lives without considering others, especially those less fortunate. The novel illustrates this through the actions of factory owners and managers, who prioritize their own wealth and success over any cost to workers or the environment. According to Upton Sinclair, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" depicting the immense pollution caused by these factories. The owners show no remorse for the people or animals harmed by this pollution, including the thousands of pens filled with animal waste.\n\nThe owners also exploit their employees, forcing them to work grueling hours and providing little compensation. Sinclair writes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers face layoffs without notice, leaving them without jobs and assistance. The lack of laws or regulations to protect workers allowed managers and owners to operate with impunity, pushing employees to work in horrific conditions. The novel suggests that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh living and working conditions. There were no agencies to aid these workers, and unions often caused more harm than good, lining their own pockets rather than helping the workers. The workers were effectively slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or attitudes toward crucial subjects. Some of these methods are more successful than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a multitude of these strategies in his novel The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, he links an adjective with a noun that doesn't typically pair to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he imparts meaning to a symbol and then uses it for this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently uses the latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up associations for these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later employs to remind readers of specific feelings related to important objects.\n\nFitzgerald imbues white/gray with a sense of uniformity, with white signifying a refined, high-class image and gray representing something older and faded. He introduces this meaning in the beginning of the novel through recurrent use of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently “in white” (8), and everyone at Gatsby’s party wears white: Nick in “white flannels” (41), Tom in a “white shirt” (36), and Catherine “powdered milky white” (30). The only time people aren’t in white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further reinforces these colors by using them to paint common, unimportant subjects: Nick commutes “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are “gray names” (61) on Nick’s schedule, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), and he describes ordinary people or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs white/gray to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity around certain subjects, starting with Daisy. After a long period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for.

Common crops include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic, community-supported agriculture food in the region, with numerous local organizations sporting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, allowing for educational and financial opportunities. This approach enables landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitat and recreational use.",
            "Culture, in essence, is a complex tapestry. It's not merely what it appears to be, but also what it isn't, and what it symbolizes. Culture isn't something uniform or singular, like a specific thing. Generalizations about cultures, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are often too broad and simplistic. While acknowledging a culture's general traits is useful, it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the significance of that culture to the situation and how it might influence the negotiation table. When interacting with a foreign culture, one naturally relates it to their own, leading to comparisons. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of judging or altering a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its guidelines, especially when negotiating from a weaker position or on foreign turf. Acknowledging traditions and beliefs can help navigate cultural barriers and propel the negotiation forward. Remember, culture isn't confined to national or international borders—most companies within a country develop their own corporate cultures. For instance, some may prioritize long office hours, while others might favor a more relaxed schedule. These nuances can be observed in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the same societal culture, there can be vast differences from company to company, or even between regions. Values are particularly crucial to understand, as they provide the underlying reasons for a culture's behaviors. If saving face or communal harmony are valued, a negotiator will avoid publicly shaming their company or superior to succeed. Conversely, if a culture emphasizes a hard-driven bargain, a negotiator won't rush to settle. While these general insights are helpful, it's also wise to learn more about the opponent's personal background to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool, in his hubris, argues that there is no God. St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two figures of considerable theological influence, both challenge this notion, each offering their own arguments to prove the existence of the Biblical God. To evaluate their arguments, we must first acknowledge their shared belief in God, as their respective defenses of this concept are the focus of our inquiry. Any deviation from this specific God would render their arguments incomparable. With this in mind, let us explore their arguments. St. Anselm's argument revolves around the notion that God's existence can be understood through faith and introspection. He posits that God is inherently part of our understanding, making the concept of God's nonexistence inconceivable. This idea, while complex and sometimes unclear, suggests that the proof of God lies within our own minds, eliminating the need for external evidence. This is a central tenet of Christian belief, often referred to as faith.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, posits that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence alone, without the need for faith. Such an approach would be advantageous for evangelism, as it allows for the recruitment of new converts based on logical persuasion rather than faith alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments in support of his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates the logical necessity for God's existence. If one piece of a puzzle were missing, logical deduction would allow us to understand and prove its existence without physically seeing it.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he renounced worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, and his teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism—the most traditional form of which is Theravada Buddhism. This religion, now about twenty-five hundred years old, has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This change can be observed today, for example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople participate in this event, which, despite Buddha never teaching about it, holds great religious significance. Such differences extend from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the perspective of monks and laypeople, has adapted its doctrinal principles over time due to both internal and external influences, ranging from hostile to benign.\n\nVarious terms are crucial to this discussion. Internal forces are those originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces negatively impact the Buddhist community, often stemming from misperceptions of Buddhism, while benign forces, though not necessarily intending to help or harm, may still influence the community. These terms will be frequently used throughout this discussion.\n\nFirst, we must explore the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is composed of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of all things. Recognizing these concepts allows one to break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which ends the trio of attachments: lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules of life, with five precepts for laypeople (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicants) and many more for monks. The most fundamental doctrine is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and the path to the end of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry that spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States emerged victorious and acquired Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. There were numerous other conflicts between the two nations, which finally eased up just before the First World War. Like many other nations, the rivalry between the United States and Mexico began due to clashes over religious, cultural, and traditional differences, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31). This is not uncommon among nations sharing a border, as the proximity often leads to rivalries over shared territory. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that “only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41), as these nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations that have maintained good relations with the U.S. Religious issues created a divide between the two nations, a problem that has plagued many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) states that “if in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). The rivalry was part ideological struggle and part competition over vital interests, not based on political structure but on religious preferences. This distrust dated back to the animosity between the English and Spanish, making amicable foreign relations difficult. Diehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this rivalry period, with most involving territorial issues such as border raids and frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American towns into Mexican territory were a persistent issue until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). The rivalry began to ease as Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the late 19th century (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, illness struck suddenly and without warning, leaving me disabled and unprepared. I was a nurse at the time, drawn to the profession due to a deep-seated need for the stability and security it promised. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" was the refrain I heard as I grew older. So, even though my heart yearned for science or journalism, I chose nursing. Yet, here I was: forty-six, single, penniless, and unable to work. For fifteen years, Social Security Disability has been my lifeline, but it has left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a battle for security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, yet one thing is clear: I would not have survived these years without the support of my family and a few steadfast friends.\n\nLife is filled with emergencies, big and small. Some challenges are too great to face alone, no matter how well we prepare. I strongly believe we should stop relying solely on large government systems that are failing. Instead, let's foster a culture of mutual trust and assistance, where we learn to help each other and ask for help when needed.\n\nConservatives often talk about the rugged individualism that built this country, but it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources that sustained our forefathers in tough times. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies did not make it alone; they relied on each other.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have emergency supplies, from first-aid kits to canned goods and water purifying tablets. I have flashlights, candles, and matches. If you have the means, consider growing your own food or installing a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you prepare, don't forget to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms adapt and evolve in the way they do? Are there limitations or constraints that guide the course of evolutionary change? While D’Arcy Thompson asserted in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same uncertainty persists today. However, recent advancements have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both in ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research aims to explore how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can reveal the mechanisms behind the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that form the basis for modeling hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to understand the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that traverses through 360 degrees of space over time, with each revolution or turn of a coiled shell called a whorl. These whorls move around an imaginary central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the central column of the shell. The enlargement rate of whorls can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl, and the spire consists of all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the base is the opposite end. The animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation of a shell is an apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upward.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and locate where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are then counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a progression of apertures through both time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as horizontal and vertical radii. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied and modified to influence the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "In Indonesia, the neonatal and infant mortality rate has barely budged over the past decade, despite the country's progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets. While strides have been made in child and maternal health, we're still far behind the goal posts for 2015. Let's delve into the reasons why and consider what needs to be beefed up: our health system, perhaps, rather than isolated program interventions.\n\nWhile we've seen a boost in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, reaching 72%, the picture isn't entirely rosy. Traditional midwives, who can't provide advanced medical care, make up a chunk of this number, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate from conditions like hemorrhage. The uptick in births attended isn't the full story here. We've also seen a dip in the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Postnatal care data is sketchy, but it's clear that it's a concern nationwide, with low rates across the board.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still subpar at 4%, with a stark urban-rural divide. Urban areas boast a 7% rate, while rural areas lag at 2%. This underscores the inequity in healthcare access, which is heavily skewed towards urban areas. Furthermore, there's a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, highlighting the struggle for the poor to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSo, as we ponder how to improve neonatal and maternal care, we must ask: should we prioritize developing targeted programs or bolstering the overall health system? Program-specific approaches are tempting. They offer clear, manageable objectives and can yield quicker results. However, they can also lead to funding and resource imbalances, with certain areas, like HIV/AIDS, receiving disproportionate attention. Moreover, running multiple parallel programs can lead to service duplication and an overwhelming amount of paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature often showcases meticulous attention to detail and an emphasis on the upper classes. Two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, typical of the period. These unusual aspects contribute to the characters' development, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n\nThese novels often use mystery and dreamlike states to convey their themes, with each approach differing. For instance, in Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences reveal his inner turmoil, the things that trouble him, and his understanding of the world around him. When Oliver revisits the shooting in chapter 28, he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, his dire health situation, and the constant fear and despair that haunt him. The shooting highlights Oliver's helplessness to effect any change, even during life-threatening situations. It suggests that he has little control over his circumstances, reinforced by the sense of defeat and resignation as if old Fagin has broken him.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years back, I was part of an after-school program tutoring elementary-aged kids. While I could help them with various subjects, my strengths were in English and reading. I was asked to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. His difficulties were peculiar; he could pronounce certain letters correctly while others were a mystery. He spoke perfect English but was having trouble with the English alphabet. It wasn't until I met his mom that I understood the issue; Adrian could read, but he didn't know the alphabet well. I hope he's improved now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, especially in California. Even a kid who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. This problem is evident, and solutions aren't straightforward. In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciations, helped. But for kids who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no single answer. Combining all approaches—dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—is the key to addressing this issue.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is beneficial. Not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for all. Studies show that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. However, fear and misconceptions surround this idea, such as it being a resource drain or unhelpful for the majority. But that's not true. If implemented as the norm, all children would benefit. How do we achieve this? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? Not necessarily. It's more practical to have bilingual aids or tutors to support these programs.",
            "From the moment we are little, many of us are told there's something greater than ourselves, something we can't fully grasp. Some of us attend Sunday school, others visit temples, or delve within ourselves for answers. Many readily embrace the faith passed down by our parents, but some reject it entirely, dismissing the possibility of anything beyond our personal realities. Still, we all journey to define pieces of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a beacon in the darkness to guide us from the shadows into the light.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, listening to the rain's relentless drumming on the tin roof above while we smoked. The gutters channeled the rain, drenching the plants along the porch's edge. He stared out into the storm, his eyes half lost in thought, half recalling memories. His once sturdy frame now seemed frail, his clothes loose and shapeless. His hair, thinned, fails to hide the signs of the illness. He gazed out into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt alone, afraid, and silenced by my fear of discussing the inevitable. I hugged him, pulled my chair closer, and joined him in watching the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\nMy father passed away five days after my twenty-second birthday, in December of that year. The treatments had not lessened his suffering but prolonged it, keeping him alive a few more months than expected. The purpose of his prolonged suffering was unclear to me. The thought of a God who would allow this crossed my mind. I found no solace in prayer that night. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening long ago.\n\nI declined to witness his passing into another realm. I couldn't bear to watch the life that formed me fade away. I chose to remember him through the life he lived, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone, better than his own family. I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in my bed for three days, awaiting the news, only to find that no one called me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt puts it, is a paradoxical blend of \"old\" and \"new,\" both in name and substance, in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both lauded and criticized, praised for its 'terrible sublime' and accused of lacking depth. The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged elements of ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new form of literary expression. Walpole combined old theatrical elements with new naturalistic mimicry in modern novels, labeling it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic novels often hark back to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, seen as archaic or unsophisticated. The fusion of the more theatrical Gothic and the novel's personal perspective is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers far removed from the original era.\n\nA prominent Gothic theme is the concept of Chivalry. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retained and transformed the medieval idea of chivalry. Chivalry, representing the ideal knight, was appealing to Gothic writers because of the lack of that ideal in contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" was idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in modern society. This is evident in his characters, particularly Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, being described as a brave and courteous knight, even if exaggeratedly so (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of operations that transforms customer orders into finished products and delivers them. This concept was introduced by Keith Oliver in 1982 and encompasses planning, implementing, and guiding the supply chain to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. The six critical components of a supply chain are production, sourcing, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business leaders utilize these elements to deliver superior customer service. Production is the cornerstone of the supply chain, involving the who, what, when, where, and how of making products. Managers must understand market demands to make informed decisions. By examining the market, managers can discern customer preferences and determine which products to produce and in what quantities. After deciding what to produce, managers must choose the optimal production location based on volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Following this, they focus on scheduling production and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial for the supply chain; each detail must be meticulously planned to avoid future costs in time and money. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, where each aspect of the business had a detailed plan, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Well-defined processes ensure smooth operations and clear expectations. The second key element in supply chain management is sourcing. This involves strategic decisions about core facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must select the best-fitting division for each product process. Outsourcing can be employed to enhance velocity, which refers to providing quality and flexibility while minimizing costs.",
            "Every day I walk down the streets of Burma, I am greeted by a haunting sign. It reads, \"Hitler is alive in Burma,\" scrawled in black Sharpie on a cardboard held by Ellen Page, the actress from Juno. Burma, or Myanmar as it is officially known, is a country in Southeastern Asia ruled by a stern military junta that seized power in 1962. In 2007, a series of public protests erupted, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" led by monks dressed in their saffron robes. The government initially allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the violence escalated, and the military openly attacked monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested, and one Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed during a street protest in September of 2007. While the official death toll stands at 13, some suggest the real number could be in the thousands.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, many governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors are considered gods. In our own time, our president, George W. Bush, reportedly holds weekly meetings with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nOther notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to protest authoritarian rule, resulting in a death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000 people. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s saw Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically kill Tutsis and political moderates. And let’s not forget Hitler's \"Third Reich,\" a period of widespread atrocities against Jews and others.",
            "Every time I listen to Duke Ellington’s music, I marvel at his enduring impact on jazz. This longevity is largely due to his mastery of his orchestra, orchestrating complex pieces that highlight each band member’s unique talents. Ellington’s compositions often feature subtle piano interplay, yet he excelled in creating rich, intricate arrangements that allowed soloists to freely improvise while maintaining a cohesive sound.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s innovative use of voice as a jazz instrument, as seen in Creole Love Call. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece uses call and response between voice and reeds to add layers of texture and color. The voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound. The muted trumpet and clarinet solos elaborate on the melody, while the full band echoes the first chorus. The climactic chorus features a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time. The final chorus returns to the original structure, with the voice taking on a “growl” technique. A brief tag ends with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone novelty.\n\nThis use of voice to enhance tone color is a signature of Ellington’s style. In Hot and Bothered, he combines tight orchestration with tone color, using Bubber Miley’s muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing to create a complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) showcases Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton’s muted trombone in a similar fashion.",
            "She had always felt an insatiable yearning for something, a need that couldn't be satisfied. This longing began when she was 14, entering her teenage years, and it persisted at 17. While she'd defined her desire as someone rather than something, she'd found no interest in boys. Some had tried to woo her, but she remained untouched. She often questioned herself, trying to deduce the cause of her indifference. Years of contemplation offered theories, but no conclusive answers.

            "This study aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a Mediterranean Diet (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower likelihood of stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a version of the Med diet, featuring increased consumption of plant-based foods (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (versus saturated fats), and fish, while lowering intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious research has shown an inverse correlation between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. An intervention trial also found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in overweight individuals. However, prior studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis research followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study—a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed score using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the previous year. More than 95% of nurses continued their participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation checks. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases without available records were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed scores from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from the two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal CHD and strokes) were recorded. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America experienced a severe financial collapse. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market plummeted, and many of America’s biggest corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues to this day, raising the question: how did this crisis happen, and how can we prevent it in the future? Simply put, the financial crisis was born from self-centered and naïve political choices that pushed banks and companies into issuing sub-prime loans to an already underprepared and weak financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks found themselves lacking capital reserves and passed this chaos onto the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration in 1999. Aiming for a second term, President Clinton sought to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions, which laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, has faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgages for low- and moderate-income people and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences, stating, “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, requiring a government rescue like the one for the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned earlier, and as Holmes foretold, reckless lending would indeed bring about economic disaster.\nMany factors combined to send the economy into a tailspin. One key factor was the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used leading up to the crisis, further entangling the economy in the housing market. This excessive use of leverage in the housing market made U.S. households and financial markets highly vulnerable to even slight price changes.\nThe housing bubble inevitably burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities high and dry. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a combined $4.1 trillion of mortgage debt in 2007, an astounding 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, holding $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",

In a film, it might be when one character shares a history with another like the Ancient Mariner. In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nLet's illustrate with an example. Picture a story where you're told that a heroine and her love met at a certain place and time, married in a grand ceremony, and tragically, her husband was murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this tale to stretch over two pages, during which both characters only utter a few lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his deep love for his wife through his speech and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to demonstrate her attachment to him in subtle and significant ways, showing how his presence enriched her life. This character development would allow you to mourn his death with her and, in turn, connect more deeply with the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you'd expect more than just the bare bones: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to offer that substance. (*takes a deep breath*) Sometimes it's tempting to skim over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who, you know, used to be in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, and secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday while indulging in a hearty breakfast of Eggs Benedict.\n\nPay attention to the meat, not just the bone.",
            "I tuned into two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live NBC 4 report on August 13, 2011, featured a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio who had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. His mug shot was shown, and he appeared menacing. The story was given two minutes, which I thought was reasonable given that it was still developing. The second story was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers who was critically injured in a shooting in Sharon Woods. There were no arrests or suspects yet, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed brief, and I suspect this was due to the victim being a minority. I've noticed that media coverage often glosses over stories involving minority victims. Conversely, if a \"white\" child or adult is involved, it's a different story. The following report was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The weather report predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This story was a teaser to keep viewers watching. A robbery at a Clime Road UDF was also reported, with the suspect described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. I found it unusual that such emphasis was placed on his race. Another story detailed the conviction of Rene Rodriguez, a Texas drug kingpin sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. It was unclear why the sentence was stated in months rather than years, and his Hispanic background seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "There's a unique bond between brothers; it's an unshakable, unchangeable connection. Within this bond, a swirl of emotions exist: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty, among others. Brothers understand each other deeply, seeing themselves reflected in one another's eyes. This bond is most evident in dire situations, where the raw emotions shine through, whether they're positive or negative. These emotions come at a price, and understanding them means dealing with their consequences. When a brother looks into another's eyes, they see not just another person but their own true self. The actions and consequences of those actions reveal their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the emotions it sparks. Through a richly described landscape, these boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment and intense pride collide in the story's climax, and only one brother survives the encounter. The theme is explored through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with others, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which shares the complex feelings of the protagonist and his views of the world, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by one key emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who would be his pupil, learning all his worldly skills like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\". He dreamed of a brother who would race to Horsehead Landing and perch with him in the great pine tree. These dreams were dashed when he realized that Doodle's weak heart made him unlikely to survive, let alone participate in vigorous activities. The protagonist even considered suffocating Doodle with a pillow, a chilling thought for a child his age, but his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple smile gave him hope, suggesting that his initial conviction was not strong. Deep down, he loved his brother.",
            "The brain, a sophisticated and imaginative information processor, has seen its metaphors evolve from ancient to contemporary. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, a book, and finally, a computer, these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to inaccurate conclusions. As you delve into the brain's workings, remember that each metaphor has a shelf life beyond which it may lose its usefulness.\n\nInformation processing begins with your senses, converting physical stimuli like tactile, thermal, auditory, or visual signals into electrochemical messages. These signals are continually transformed by the brain's algorithms, using both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple data like color, orientation, and edge location to recognize the box. Top-down processing employs earlier decisions to expedite the identification process, such as distinguishing a black box from a hole.\n\nAttention filters, crucial for information processing, decide the signal's importance and which cognitive processes should engage with it. For instance, while your brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from individually noticing them. Conversely, your name can be picked out even in a noisy environment. Various processing stages, each repeatedly influenced by attention, shape the final output.\n\nInformation must be stored for the brain to process it effectively. Different types of memory exist: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is initially encoded, with unique encoding methods for different stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally (how the word looks), phonemically (how it sounds), or semantically (what it means). Maintaining stored information involves various mechanisms, with working memory, which holds data for around 20 seconds, being sustained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nMany theories describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can further connect to “wooden,” illustrating the complex web of associations.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" serves as a cautionary tale about the looming threats of technology and capitalism, illustrating a dystopian society where the individual is overshadowed by the collective. From birth, citizens are conditioned to prioritize immediate happiness over all else, with the World Controller dictating their lives. This can be analyzed through a Marxist lens, highlighting the author's concerns about the developments of such systems. Key terms like homogeny and reification emphasize the commentaries on the flaws of the capitalist economy from Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the general populace remains unaware of their true economic relations. The workers, or \"proletariat,\" are manipulated into consuming and indulging, driven by hypnopædia, thus reinforcing the capitalist structure. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, are completely unaware of their manipulation, while the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, may be aware but remain complacent. Hegemony, the idea that one class dominates another, is evident here, with the lower classes buying into the ideology of capitalism and consumerism. The lack of meaningful relationships and the superficial nature of interactions – with comments focusing on physical appearance – further highlight the societal impact of capitalism. Man's free will is suppressed, and emotions are kept in check, illustrating how capitalism can oppress individuals and control their actions.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for about two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the sprawling campus can be a challenge, especially for freshmen like me who were placed in East Halls dorms, which are far from the center. Walking to classes in places like the Willard building can take up to 25 minutes on a bad weather day. Not long ago, these East Halls were isolated by vast, empty fields, but now they're surrounded by new sports facilities, buildings, and apartments, making it even harder to get around. The solution? Cycling. But it's not just about having a bike; the campus needs to be designed for cyclists too.\n\nRecently, I spoke to a friend who returned to cycling after a hiatus. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around, and it's good for you too.\" Cycling is incredibly efficient - a bowl of oatmeal and a bit of exercise can take you far. I, too, live off campus, and the smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. Instead of walking to Thomas building, which would take 25 minutes, I can now get there in just 5 minutes by bike. However, Pollock Road, the straightest path to Thomas, isn't always pleasant to cycle on. While walking has its merits, I'm too busy to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. Over the course of a week, that's over two and a half hours. Add that to the time spent walking to other classes and appointments, and it's more time than I can spare."
